There's things that you guess
And a'things a'that you know
There's boys you can trust
And a'girls that you don't
There's little things you hide
And little things that you show
Sometimes you think you're gonna get it
But you don't and that's just the way it goes

[Pre - Chorus]
I swear I won't tease you
Won't tell you no lies (Yeah)
Don't need no Bible
Just look in my eyes
I've a'waited so long baby
Now that we're friends
Every man's got his patience
And here's where mine ends

I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex

Sex is best when it's one on one

Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are (Ooo)
Or would you rather be a mule?

[Verse 1: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
A mule is an animal with long funny ears
He kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak
And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

[Chorus 2: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are, doo doo
Or would you rather be a pig?

[Verse 2: Bing Crosby & Chorus]
A pig is an animal with dirt on his face
His shoes are a terrible disgrace
He has no manners when he eats his food
He's fat and lazy and extremely rude
But if you don't care a feather or a fig
You may grow up to be a pig

He can't write his name or read a book
To fool the people is his only thought

But then if that sort of life is what you wish
You may grow up to be a fish

A new kind of jumped up slippery fish

Run, run, 'til you're spun, one shot, one gun
One 911 emergency, it's murder, B
It's excellent execution when I'm pulling the trigger
No mistake for that cake, I'm hitting you and your niggas
Feel the flame when I aim for the top of your brain
See the spark and the bang, nigga, shit ain't a game

Goes through your ass fast and the leather seat in your Nav

Walked many roads to witness ancient idols

Gave armies reason to rise

Two great European narcotics, alcohol and Christianity
I know which one I prefer

[Chorus: Mike Skinner, Laura Vane & The Wayne Hart Singers]
We never went to church
Just get on with work and sometimes things'll hurt
But it's hit me since you left us
And it's so hard not to search
If you were still about
I'd ask you what I'm supposed to do now
I just get a bit scared every now
I hope I made you proud

[Verse 1: Mike Skinner]
On your birthday when mum passed the forks and spoons
I put my head on the table, I was so distraught with you
You tidied your things into the bin the more poorly you grew
So there's nothing of yours to hold or to talk to
You put your hand up and interrupt the conversation with a ""But""
People say I interrupt people with the same look
Sometimes I think so hard, I can't remember how your face looked
Started reading about dreams in your favourite book
I panic and pace when I can't see the right thing to do
You'd be scratching your head through the best advice you knew
And I feel sad I can't hear you reciting it through
I miss you, Dad, but I've got nothing to remind me of you

[Verse 2: Mike Skinner]
I needed a break when your book about dreams was taken
I needed to pray or see a priest that day
I needed to leave this trade and just heave it away
But I cleaned up my place like you so I could see things straight
I never cared about God when life was sailin' on the calm
So I said I'd get my head down
And I'd deal with the ache in my heart
And, for that, if God exists, I'd reckon he'd pay me regard
Mum says me and you are the same from the start
I guess, then, you did leave me something to remind me of you
Every time I interrupt someone like you used to
When I do something like you, you'll be on my mind all through
'Cause I forgot you left me behind to remind me of you

[Chorus: Mike Skinner, Laura Vane & The Wayne Hart Singers]
We never went to church

But you used to tell me how you didn't know
What to do, even now
And then I'm not so scared somehow
'Cause I know that you'd be proud

Don't let 'em run, hurry up and catch 'em
You grab an arm, I grab an arm let's pull 'till we stretch 'em
Play pussy, get fucked means you're better off dead
I wanted seafood so I fished in a child’s head
Motherfuckers beware cause I'm sick
Dead heads and frog legs, mmm... cake mix!
Friday the 13th the night of the living dead
Vampire arms walkin' 'round givin niggas head
If you didn't die, I would say you got lucky
All bodies found dead, fuck it, blame it on Chuckie
But this is child's play... motherfucka!!!

Gimme some barb and I'll start by killin me

Now 100 missiles blew a little girl's back off
My name is Chuckie, some say I'm insane
You give me some gin, and I might eat a dog's brain
Give me a motherfuckin 15-pack
And I'll be damned if I don't bring 15 dead niggas back
A murder contest, you know I'll win it
Cause in every mailbox, there be a head with a knife in it
I'm gettin' hungry, I need to be fed
I feel like eatin' a bag of barbequed broke legs
Bustin' necks with a motherf*ckin' brick!
Half my body is Chuckie, the other half is Bushwick
A short nigga always pumpin' some lead
I haven't figured out a way to get my fist out your forehead
What up? Get up, sit up, you get lit up
A knife in his neck made a polar bear spit up
A 9, a Uzi is my only utensil
Inside his chest they found 10,000 pencils
You have the nerve to go against Chuck?
With fifty guns aimed at you, how the fuck you gonna duck, yo?

Was lightning from the top of a cloud
Moving through the dark
A million miles an hour with somewhere to be

So why does it seem like a picture
That's hangin' up on someone else's wall?
Lately I just haven't been myself at all
It's heavy on my mind

And I'm dreamin' again
Like I've always been
Way down low
I still know

That the prettiest thing I ever did see
Was dusty as the handle on the door
Rusty as a nail stuck in the old pine floor
It looks like home to me

Now I'm dreamin' again
Like I've always been

Poor thing

There was this judge, you see
Wanted her like mad
Every day he sent her a flower
But did she come down from her tower?
Sat up there and sobbed by the hour
Poor fool
But there was worse yet to come, poor thing

Well, Beadle calls on her all polite
Poor thing, poor thing
The Judge, he tells her, is all contrite
He blames himself for her dreadful plight
She must come straight to his house tonight
Poor thing, poor thing
Of course, when she goes there
Poor thing, poor thing
They're having this ball all in masks
There's no one she knows there
Poor dear, poor thing
She wanders tormented and drinks, poor thing
The Judge has repented, she thinks, poor thing
""Oh, where is Judge Turpin?"", she asks

He was there all right, only not so contrite

She wasn't no match for such craft, you see
And everyone thought it so droll
They figured she had to be daft, you see
So all of them stood there and laughed, you see
Poor soul
Poor thing

Hurt repeatedly

I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

Been here all along, so why can't you see?

I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

A beam light from a red, velvet moon illuminates me

From perfect skies, a dark and vengeful day
Faith and mercy gone astray

With strength of infinite measure
The mighty sword divides order from chaos in the kingdom below
And from the mansions of glory

I sacrifice my truth and loyalty
Seven deadly sins consume you all, a dance with death
I taste the victory

Rising from the north – the warrior prince (Eternal is the pain that leads me to temptation)
Judgment without compassion eyes of fear
Like the River Styx, the gates of hell (Eternal is the pain that leads me to temptation)
""Abandon hope all ye who enter here""

In the streets, the wind throws yesterday's headlines around
Another night comes and goes

So, for awhile back then there was someplace to go
Somewhere more home than a house
A family of choice, not an accident, but sometimes as soon as something gets started it's over

Now the days are much shorter and the people from the good part of town all come around, but the something is missing even though there's more there now
I shrug off my attempts to explain how a torn t-shirt made it all danger again

I don't like flashbacks in movies
I like the story to proceed
I don't like talking about the old days except if it tells where the future will lead

So we take a walk down this haunted hall or stumble through a shattered recall
I know there's nothing to relive, it's just the shape of it all
I don't want it different
Don't want it again but value for value, now I'd never want it to end
You think of the old friends and faces no more to be seen
You think how much fun a line-up would mean

And once that tape starts playing, it's too hard to make it rewind
That one special face takes over your mind

That end of the run
We almost won
The end of the run
We had our fun
The end of the run

Cause that was the season we make our dreams come true
There was no limit to what we could do

Though I know you're not home

You got your hair combed back and your
Sunglasses on, baby
And I can tell you, my love for you will still be strong
After the boys of summer have gone

I never will forget those nights
I wonder if it was a dream
Remember how you made me crazy? (Crazy)

I saw a Black Flag sticker on a Cadillac

Those days are gone forever
I should just let 'em go, but

When you see my friends sitting outside they were
There to help me pack my bags and
Tell me don't listen to you if you're beggin
Cause they know I'm coming straight back home to you
And they know I'm a constant fool for you
So I'm putting my things on a U-haul
And I'm blockin out your number when you call

No conversation you can keep your words
Cause 90% I done already heard
How long did you think that I would sit here for?

With his corny jokes and his cheap cigars
He could look you in the eye and sell you a car
That's not an easy thing to do
But no one ever knew a more charming creature
On this earth than my old man

He was a pilot in the big war in the U.S. Army Air Corps
In a C-47 with a heavy load
Full of combat cargo for the Burma Road
And after they dropped the bomb
He came home and married mom
And not long after that
He was my old man

And oh the fights we had
When my brother and I got him mad
He'd get all boiled up and he'd start to shout
And I knew what was coming so I tuned him out
And now the old man's gone, and I'd give all I own
To hear what he said when I wasn't listening
To my old man

I miss the old man tonight
And I can almost see his face
He was always trying to watch his weight
And his heart only made it to fifty-eight
For the first time since he died
Late last night I cried
I wondered when I was gonna do that

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it get sky high
We wasn't s'posed to make it past twenty-five
Joke's on you, we still alive

""We don't care what people say"" (Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If this is your first time hearin' this
You are about to experience somethin' so cold, man
We never had nothin' handed, took nothin' for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty, I looked up to the dope man
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flicking Starter coats, man—man, you don't know, man
We don't care what people say
This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer, they ain't finna say, ""Next summer, I'm finna...""
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil' Trey's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for having no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' your ass at home
So we forced to sell crack, rap, and get a job
You gotta do somethin', man, your ass is grown

We claim other people kids on our income tax
We take that money, cop work, then push packs to get paid
And we don't care what people say
Mama say she wanna move South
Scratching lottery tickets, eyes on a new house
'Round the same time, Doe ran up in dude house
Couldn't get a job
So since he couldn't get work, he figured he'd take work
The drug game bulimic, it's hard to get weight
So niggas' money is homo, it's hard to get straight
But we gon' keep bakin' 'til the day we get cake
And we don't care what people say, my niggas—

When you stop the programs for after school
And they DCFS, some of 'em dyslexic
They favorite 50 Cent song ""12 Questions""
We scream: ""Rocks, blow, weed, park,"" see, now we smart
We ain't retards the way teachers thought
Hold up, hold fast, we make more cash
Now, tell my mama I belong in that slow class
It's bad enough we on welfare
You tryna put me on the school bus with the space for the wheelchair
I'm tryna get the car with the chromey wheels here
You tryna cut our lights out like we don't live here
Look what was handed us, fathers abandoned us
When we get them hammers, go on, call the ambulance
Sometimes, I feel no one in this world understands us
But we don't care what people say, my niggas—

As meaningful to you as words written in water
I'm left to walk this world alone
In a broken mold they made me

I did something, now I'm nothing
Always wrong with this or that
Poisoned with fear
Watch it twist my measly brain mad

Talk about me when my back is turned
Next time we meet, it will be too late
The memory burnt in my ears of what you said
And now I've got a recipe for hate, taste it
Dark clouds on the horizon make it hard to breathe
A walking mistake
But every time I run away
I just come back for more
The choice is clear
I can quit and fall on my sword
Or light a fire to see who runs or stays
And plays the confidence game

Walking straight into a roadblock
Ending left, here bending
Your point of view was chosen by the serpent's ruse

[Verse 2]
With all its do's and don'ts
The future is an empty promise
Unconcerned and so tired of waiting
We could sell it wooden horses
Full of nightmares and when they open
This all might recompose
There's no going back to the good old days
It's just a phase bring in some new life
Archaism is a dusty road leading us back to nowhere

123,ML124,Pearl Jam,Crazy Mary,sad,"[Verse 1]
She lived on the curve in the road
In an old tar paper shack
On the south side of the town
On the wrong side of the tracks
Sometimes on the way into town
We'd say, ""Mama can we stop and give her a ride?""
Sometimes we did
But her hands flew from her side
Wild eyed crazy Mary

[Verse 2]
Down the long dirt road
Past the Parson's place
That old blue car
We used to race
Little country store with a sign tacked to the side
Said 'NO L-O-I-T-E-R-I-N-G ALLOWED.'
Underneath that sign always congregated quite a crowd

[Chorus]
Take a bottle drink it down, pass it around
Take a bottle drink it down, drink it... pass it around, pass it a...
A-take a bottle drink it down, pass it... pass it a... pass it around

[Verse 3]
One night thunder cracked
Mercy backed outside my windowsill
Dreamed I was flying
High above the trees, over the hills
Looked down into the house of Mary
Bare bulb hung, newspaper covered walls
And Mary rising up above it all
Oh... oh... oh...
[Verse 4]
Next morning on the way into town
Saw some skid marks and followed them around
Over the curve
Through the fields
Into the house of Mary

[Pre-Chorus]
That what you fear the most could meet you halfway
That what you fear the most could meet you halfway

[Chorus]
Take a bottle drink it down, pass it around
Take a bottle drink it down, pass it... pass it around, pass it a...

Vai, minha tristeza
E diz a ela que sem ela não pode ser
Diz-lhe numa prece que ela regresse
Porque eu não posso mais sofrer

Chega de saudade
A realidade é que sem ela não há paz
Não há beleza, é só tristeza e a melancolia
Que não sai de mim, não sai de mim, não sai

Mas se ela voltar, se ela voltar
Que coisa linda, que coisa louca
Pois há menos peixinhos a nadar no mar
Do que os beijinhos que eu darei na sua boca

And a coffee shop

I just want you around

Seconds and hours pass slowly

My hair is turning black
There's a rythm behind it
That you can't know

Still, I want you around

Wake the child from her sleep
Wipe the eyes of the dewy morning

My world revolved around him, I couldn't lie there anymore
So I made my way down, the mirrored hall, and tapped upon his door

[Chorus]

How would I go on, with you gone that way?
Don't wanna cry anymore, so may I stay with you?""
And he said ""That's my job, that's what I do
Everything I do is because of you, to keep you safe with me
That's my job, you see.""

[Verse 2]
Later we barely got along, this teenage boy and he
Most of the fights it seems were over different dreams
We each held for me
He wanted knowledge and learning, I wanted to fly out west
I said ""I could make it out there, if I just had the fare
I got half, will you loan me the rest?""

And I said, ""Daddy, I'm so afraid
There's no guarantee in the plans I've made
And if I should fail, who will pay my way back home?""

Get ready for the pain

If being right means being without you, I'd rather live a wrong doing life
Mom and daddy say, ""It's a shame, it's a downright disgrace""
Long as I got you by my side, I don't care what your people say

I can't see you when I want to, I'll see you when I can
If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right

Am I wrong to fall so deeply in love with you
Knowing you got a wife and two little children depending on you too?
Am I wrong to hunger for the gentleness of your touch
Knowing I got someone else at home, who needs me just as much?

Am I wrong, give my love to a married man?
Am I wrong tryin' to hold on to the best thing I ever had?
If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right

Am I wrong, give my love to a married man?
Tell me, am I wrong for trying to hold on to the best thing that I ever had?

I thought I'd take a walk today
It's a mistake I sometimes make
My kids lay asleep in bed
My wife lay wide-awake
I kissed her softly on the brow
I tried not to make a sound
But with stony eyes she looked at me
And gently squeezed my hand
Call it a premonition, call it a crazy vision
Call it intuition, something learned from mother
But when she looked up at me, I could clearly see
The Sword of Damocles hanging directly above her

[Chorus]
Oh Lord Oh my Lord
Oh Lord
How have I offended thee?
Wrap your tender arms around me
Oh Lord Oh Lord
Oh My Lord

[Verse 2]
They called at me through the fence
They were not making any sense
They claimed that I had lost the plot
Kept saying that I was not
The man I used to be
They held their babes aloft
Threw marsh mellows at the Security
And said that I'd grown soft
Call it intuition, call it a creeping suspicion
But their words of derision meant they hardly knew me
For even I could see in the way they stared at me
The Spear of Destiny sticking right through me

Now I'm at the hairdressers
People watch me as they move past
A guy wearing plastic antlers
Presses his bum against the glass
Now I'm down on my hands and knees
And it's so fucking hot!
Someone cries, ""What are you looking for?""
I scream, ""The plot, the plot!""
I grab my telephone, I call my wife at home
She screams, ""Leave us alone!"" I say, ""Hey, it's only me""
The hairdresser with his scissors, he holds up the mirror
I look back and shiver; I can't even believe what I can see

[Verse 4]
Be mindful of the prayers you send
Pray hard but pray with care
For the tears that you are crying now
Are just your answered prayers
The ladders of life that we scale merrily
Move mysteriously around
So that when you think you're climbing up, man
In fact you're climbing down
Into the hollows of glamour, where with spikes and hammer
With telescopic camera, they chose to turn the screw
Oh I hate them, Ma! Oh I hate them, Pa!
Oh I hate them all for what they went and done to you

Eluder of the fucked up styles that get wicked
So come on as I start to kick it
'Cause we're like the outlaws striding, suckers are hiding
Jump behind the bush when they see me driving by
Hanging out my window
And my magnum taking out some putos
Acting kinda loco, I'm just another local kid
From the street getting paid for my vocals

Hummin', comin' at ya

Time for some action, just a fraction of friction (Uh)
I got the clearance to run the interference
Into your satellite, shining a battle light
Swing out the gat, and I know that we'll gat you right
Here's an example, just a little sample
How I could just kill a man
One time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said, ""Yo, it's on
Take cover, son, or you're assed out
How'd you like my chrome?"" Then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast him but I did anyway

When you haven't been where I've been?

Sometimes i´m quite amused
To see it twist and turn
To taste - both sweet and dry

As others their wine

Gestrandet an leben und kunst
Und das spiel geht weiter

You try to force a smile -
As if to compensate -
Then you break down and cry

My master is calling - she is calling

She stays my hunger with a burning meal
And I feel shelter in her bloody sea
I call her devil and I call her God
She cures my soul while my senses rot

My master's calling - she is calling

I'm burned by love the heart of earth

Does one dare to think for himself?
The paradox of power and peace
Will destroy itself
To know the truth and live in fear of no man
To realize that this, in itself, is an ascension

O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent
Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help
Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round
They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels
My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death
For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet

Down in the workshop, all the elves were making toys
For the good Gentile girls and the good Gentile boys
When the boss busted in, nearly scared them half to death
Had a rifle in his hands and cheap whiskey on his breath
From his beard to his boots, he was covered with ammo
Like a big fat drunk disgruntled Yuletide Rambo
And he smiled as he said with a twinkle in his eye
""Merry Christmas to all! Now you're all gonna die!""

[Chorus]
The night Santa went crazy
The night Saint Nick went insane
Realized he'd been getting a raw deal
Something finally must have snapped in his brain

[Verse 2]
Well, the workshop is gone now—he decided to bomb it
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet
And he tied up his helpers, and he held the elves hostage
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage
He got Dancer and Prancer with an old German Luger
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger
And he picked up a flamethrower and he barbecued Blitzen
And he took a big bite and said, ""It tastes just like chicken!""

Goddamn, it's a brand new payback
From the straight gangsta mack in straight gangsta black
How many motherfuckers gotta pay?
Went to the shelf and dusted off the AK
Caps gotta get peeled
Cause ""The Nigga Ya Love to hate"" still can ""Kill at Will""
It ain't no pop cause that sucks
And you can New Jack Swing on my nuts
Down wit' the niggas that I bail out
I'm platinum, bitch, and I didn't have to sell out
""Fuck you, Ice Cube"", that's what the people say
Fuck America, still with the triple K
'Cause you know when my nine goes buck
It'll bust your head like a watermelon dropped from twelve stories up
Now let's see who'll drop
Punk motherfuckers tryin' to ban hip-hop
Fuck R&B and the runnin' man
I'm the one that stand, with the gun in hand
Make sure before you buck wit' duck quick

Hell yeah it's on, you better tell 'em
Ice Cube and I'm rolling with the motherfuckin' L.M
It's the number one crew in the area
Make a move for your gat and I'll bury ya
Ashes to ashes, dirt to dirt
Punks roll when I put in work
'Cause Lench Mob niggas are the craziest
And y'all motherfuckers can't fade my shit
South Central, that's where the Lench Mob dwell
Hittin' fools up with the big ass L
One time can't hold me back

Stop givin' juice to the Raiders
Cause Al Davis never paid us
I hope he wear a vest

That keeps me longing
For someone there, for someone new
You were so good
In doing the wrong thing
Now I'll be good in being untrue
I've bad my share
Of lazy lovers

Somebow, somewhere
You will discover
A decent girl named Belle de Jour
Glamour, fashion, diamond rings
Cars with shiny chrome
I rather care for simple things
Pure testosterone
What an affair
That keeps me longing
For someone there, for someone new

266,ML267,Dolores Keane,Never Be the Sun,relaxed,"You'll never be the sun turning in the sky
And you won't be the moon above us on the moonlit night
And you won't be the stars in heaven although they burn so bright
But even on the deepest ocean you will be the light

You may not always shine as you go barefoot over stones
You might be so long together or you might walk alone
And you'll find that love comes easy
Or that love is always right
So even when the storm clouds gather you will be the light

And if you lose a parting side when love turns round on you
Leaving the past behind is knowing you'll do like you always
Holding you blind
Keeping you true

You'll never be the sun turning in the sky
And you won't be the moon above us on the moonlit night
And you won't be the stars in heaven although they burn so bright
But even on the deepest ocean you will be the light

Who the boss? Niggas get tossed to the side
And I'm the dark side of the Force
Of course it's the Method, Man from the Wu-Tang Clan

But when the world was cold and black, you got by, and you survived

They say it gets easier at the end of everyday, so why do I wake up with tears?
You can turn a phrase 10million ways, and still it won't be true

Love is gravity with a pull that you can't deny, thats why you're always falling
But when you hit the ground you can't stay down, your life is calling

I bet you never thought it could be that bad, that nothing else could bring you back

Well, jackie jackson was a greedy boy
That's right, he liked to stuff his face
The thing that gave that boy the greatest joy
Was eating far too many cakes
And he ate one, two, three, four
But jackie wanted more
Five, six, seven, eight
Jackie had another plate
And by the time he got to twenty
Anybody woulda thought that he'd had plenty
But he had another eight which
Which makes it twenty-eight
So when he got to twenty-eight
He stopped
He stopped eating cakes but only because he'd run out of cakes
But
Jackie jackson was a greedy boy
Yes, he said, ""i've not had enough
I think that i could eat a thousand cakes
Then i could eat a thousand more
Because
Because i love the taste of tasty cakes
I think i'll find myself some more!""
And he did
He went down to the local shop where there were loads of cakes
Loads of cakes
So he ate one, two, three, four, five and six
Well, jackie was a little bit sick
And didn't stop when he got to eight
And said, ""i love the taste of cakes!
I love the taste of cakes, that's right
I'll eat all day and i'll eat all night""
And one, two, three, four
Jackie had a little bit more
At seventeen he said, ""i need to eat until the shop is clean
And cakes, and all the cakes pass through my mouth
I munch up a banana
I munched up cakes into my large expanding gut
My large expanding gut.""
And he did, he ate 32 cakes in that shop and
Ah, he'd already eaten 28 cakes
28 and 32, that means he'd eaten 60 cakes
And, well, do you think that jackie jackson's had eaten enough cakes?
Well, jackie was a greedy boy
He said, ""i'll never have enough!""
He ate 10, 20, 30, 40
Jackie said he'd never thought he'd
Get to eat so many tasty cakes and ate another 80
Jackie gave a little moan
His stomach gave a little groan
Jackie yelled and cried, ""oh no! I think my belly's overloaded! My belly's overloaded! My belly's overloaded! My belly's overloaded! My belly's overloaded!""
Bang!

He'd eaten over 200!

Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check
Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck

Ride wit' Her, 'cause I know for me She'd die

Walk this earth for Her, glory, I'm grateful

When my baby broke my heart and left me yearning

Glaring, tearing through me
Someone said welcome to your doom
Then they smiled with eyes
That looked as if they knew me
This is scaring me

She'll run to me
Like whispered dreams
Your eyes can't see
Soft and warm
She'll touch my face
A bed of straw
Against the lace

We believed we'd catch the rainbow
Ride the wind to the sun
Sail away on ships of wonder
But life's not a wheel
With chains made of steel
So bless me
Come the dawn

But should he abandon his supposed 'obedience'
To the 'White liberal doctrine' of non-violence
And embrace Black Nationalism

To pinpoint potential troublemakers and neutralize them

They're nailing up the coffin but you're smiling as you go

And tolerance depends upon the song you sing

Falling from an altercation, you're put in a situation
Denied access to the one thing bound to stop you going under

And tell a tale of springtime
Someone will call, hungry to spite me
Absent from luck and blame so slightly

In sight, the tale goes hiding
Reveal a bite, skin tightening
Soon gone the thought, am I distracted
Please cover up, our lies are abandoned

We took the tale so lightly

At ease
Eating well
No more microwave dinners and saturated fats
A patient, better driver
A safer car
Baby smiling in back seat
Sleeping well, no bad dreams
No paranoia
Careful to all animals
Never washing spiders down the plughole
Keep in contact with old friends
Enjoy a drink now and then
Will frequently check credit at moral bank
Hole in wall
Favors for favors
Fond, but not in love
Charity standing orders
On Sundays ring road supermarket
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
Car wash, also on Sundays
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows
Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
Nothing so childish
At a better pace
Slower and more calculated
No chance of escape
Now self-employed
Concerned, but powerless
An empowered and informed member of society Pragmatism, not idealism
Will not cry in public
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet
Shot of baby strapped in back seat
A good memory
Still cries at a good film
Still kisses with saliva

I will survive
Without you
Don't tell me that you wanna leave
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

If you wanna leave
I won't beg you to stay
And if you gotta go, darling
Maybe it's better that way

I'm gonna be strong, I'm gonna be fine
Don't worry about this heart of mine
Walk out that door, see if I care
Go on and go, but

[Chorus]
Don't turn around
'Cause you're gonna see my heart breaking
Don't turn around
I don't want you seeing me cry
Just walk away

Cause these Westside niggas is harder thugs
Enslave us but nothing can save us from sporting Ben Davis
Shootin' at your neighbors
Cause sometimes I feel like a nut
Don’t give a fuck when I open you up
Hot rocks
Fly from the back seat
And busta-ass niggas run like a track meet
And if you caught in the middle

Nothing to gain nothing to lose

Her stomach bursts, the casket breaks
The seed has taken form
A writhing shape of twisted flesh
The Devil's child is thrown
Hungry for the smell of death
He rules forbidden evil
Vengeance with a frenzied hatred
The bastard now must die

[Bridge]
Lost souls of the dead
Form legions that burst through Hell's gates
Death of one sacrifice
To avenge the raped corpse from the grave
Blood of one mortal man
The fire grows stronger within
Fate of a frenzied lust
Lucifer takes my dark soul

How many of you people out there
Been hurt in some kind of love affair
And how many times do you swear that you'll never love again?
How many lonely, sleepless nights
How many lies, how many fights
And why would you want to put yourself through all that again?
""Love is pain,"" I hear you say
Love has a cruel and bitter way
Of paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain
How could it be that what you need the most
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?
You never want to feel so sad and lost again
One day you could be looking
Through an old book in rainy weather
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together
You could be walking down the street
And who should you chance to meet
But that same old smile that you've been thinking of all day

Swims like seaweed down the hall
He briefly digs your wiggy pad
And seeps out through the wall

Liquid light on New York City
Like Christmas without the chintzy stuff

What exactly does he want

And eat cornpone 'til it's comin' outta my ears

And when they calm down nothing ever feels the same
Sheltered under the Kamani tree
Waiting for the passing rain

Listen close enough, all else fades

Her eye sockets dry and empty, her heels and elbows scraped and bloodied. Some on-lookers gasped in horror, some swooned and fainted melodramatically, most just stared in disbelief. Jennifer reached down between her thighs and pulled the crotch of her bathing suit to the side - exposing her vagina. The other girl slowly sat up and began sliding her fingers into Jennifer. A few minutes later, her wrists were in, then her elbows. Eventually she would completely disappear into her womb. Jennifer tilted her head to the side curiously.

Feeding on hunger and glaring through the promise
Upon the food that rots slowly in the aisle

That hides the graves beneath the master's hill
Buried for drinking the river's water while
Shackled to the the line at the empty well

""Take hope here, war is elsewhere
You were chosen, this is God's land
Soon we'll be free of blot and mixture
Seeds planted by our forefathers' hand""

Like the pockets of the new world kings
Like swollen stomachs In Appalachia
Like the priest that fucked you as he whispered holy things

Sharpened on suffering and woven into the slings
Hope lies in the rubble of this rich fortress
Taking today what tomorrow never brings

That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef (What?)

You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child? Scared to smile, they called you ugly?
Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TECs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case

Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn, though

Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy (Ill)

Remember how it all began
The apple and the fall of man
The price we paid
So the people say

Down a path of shame it lead us
Dared to bite the hand that fed us
The fairy tale
The moral end
The wheel of fortune
Never turns again

The worst of it has come and gone
In the chaos of millennium
In the falling out of the doomsday crowd
Their last retreat is moving slow
They burn their bridges as they go
The heretic is beautified
He'll teach the harlot's child to smile

Wracked again by indecision
Should we make that small incision
Testify to the bleeding heart inside?
We cut, we scratched
We ran, we slashed
And when he opened up at last
Found a cul-de-sac
Deep and black
Of smoke and ash
Deep and black

Consider well and bear in mind
What our good God for us has done
In sending His beloved Son
With Mary holy we should pray
To God with love this Christmas Day:
In Bethlehem upon that morn
There was a blessed Messiah born

Near Bethlehem did shepherds keep
Their flocks of lambs and feeding sheep;
To whom God's angels did appear
Which put the shepherds in great fear
""Arise and go,"" the angels said
""To Bethlehem, be not afraid;
For there you'll find, this happy morn
A princely Babe, sweet Jesus born.""

With thankful heart and joyful mind
The shepherds went the Babe to find
And as God's angel had foretold
They did our Saviour Christ behold
Within a manger He was laid
And by his side the Virgin Maid
As long foretold upon that morn

But the ache goes away, if you could see

And bring 'em back to the pad out by the woods

Say that I'm a bad girl, though I should

And is my life as bare as it is?
Cold and lonely enough?
Have you achieved what you were longing for?
Sad enough this cannot be undone

The reflection in the mirror of me
Have you given up, my friend?
Forgiveness be mine

I still reach for the stars, but all I touch is my horizon
Can I call this my burden
Or is this just my dream to fly?
I would be crying tears of laughter
If I could see me smile againEmbed"

But the girls want to know why boys like us so much
They like way we dance, they like the way we work
They like the way that L.A.M.B. is going 'cross my shirt
They like the way my pants, it compliments my shape (She's crazy, right?)

In the hour of our twilight
And soon it will be all said and done
And we will all be back together, as one
If we will continue at all

May god have mercy on our dirty little hearts

And all of this is a consequence
Brought on by our own hand
If you believe in that sort of thing
And did you ever really find
When you closed your eyes
Any place that was still
And at peace?
And I guess I just wanted to tell you
As the light starts to fade
That you are the reason
That I am not afraid
And I guess I just wanted to mention
As the heavens will fall
We will be together soon, if we
Will be anything at all

Shame on us for all we have done

You're deaf to it, blind to it
Been like a thunderclap
Feel the prickles running
Up and down your back
Why so divine, the pain of love?

[Verse 2]
You have to work at it, stay with it
Pay for it, bust your ass
Lie for it, cheat for it
Forget about your past
Why so divine, the pain of love?

[Verse 3]
You dream of it passionate
You get a rise from it
Feel the hot cum
Dripping on your thighs from it
Why is that so divine, the pain of love?

[Verse 4]
Sometimes you crave for it, cry for it
Women will die for it
Looking back, cut the crap
Was it really worth the rap?
It's hard to survive the pain of love

Gone are the old times when we used to say
Oh a woman was younger she knew what to do
Oh but I look around me, now that's not so

I'm lost on that open road no peace do I find
Maybe the wind'll blow a melody and ease my mind

But soon love is broken, they'll take you away
Oh the wars they been growing as no relief
And the old men who ruled them oh they're just like thieves
They rob from the sunshine, oh the air ain't so clean
Our rivers are dirty where once we could see

A smile from your lady friend looking down
Look at that river hey did you ever shiver
Well the earth is broken there is no one to save

I remember quite freely only yesterday
Ah the letter that I read from you read this way
Take care lonesome Timmy, ah don't you start
Thinking you're the only one year that's gone
Out on your lonesome road hey lend a hand to your friend
Yes he's just as lonely and the wind keeps you cold

Remember the rivers that once did flow clean

All the old folks have gone west, Lord preparing to die

Living each day with trivial hearts

We just stop once in a while cry over the news
In some foreign far city your brother's shot down

Because there was a reason a gun had a hand
And the old man killed youth, squeezed down its hope
Now I'm just waiting brother waiting for the land
Soon in my country there won't be a friend
Each one is trying so hard to defend
That one one last heartbeat before he's tugged away

Lost in the mechanized efficient world logical skies

Ah but no song was written on without a tear in your eyes

Turn back while there's time

No doubt, indeed
Where that weed? Nahmsayin'?
That old real shit

[Verse 1: Prodigy]
There's a war goin' on outside no man is safe from
You could run, but you can't hide forever
From these streets that we done took
You walkin' with your head down, scared to look
You shook, ‘cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
It's similar to Vietnam
Now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cops' control
They better have the riot gear ready
Tryin' to bag me and get rocked steady!
By the MAC one-double, I touch you
And leave you with not much to go home with
My skin is thick, ‘cause I be up in the mix of action
If I'm not at home, puffin' lye, relaxin'
New York got a nigga depressed
So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
God bless my soul
Before I put my foot down and begin to stroll
Into the drama I built
And all unfinished beef, you will soon be killed
Put us together — it's like mixin' vodka and milk
I'm goin out blastin', takin' my enemies with me
And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
Lord, forgive me, the Hennessy got me not knowin' how to act
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
Or maybe it's the words from my man Killa Black
That I can't say, so it's left a untold fact

I'm trapped in between two worlds, tryin' to get dough
Y'know, when the dough get low, the juice go
But never that! As long as fiends smoke crack
I'll be on the block hustlin', countin' my stacks
No doubt, watchin' my back and proceed with caution
Five-O's lurkin', no time to get lost in the system
Niggas usin' fake names to get out quick
My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
I live a world where squads hit the block hard
Ask my man Twin, when he got bagged, that fucked me up, God
But shit happens for a reason
You find out who's your true peoples when you're Upstate bleedin'
You can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you
Hit with a two-to-four is difficult
Wild on the streets, I try to maintain
Tight with my loot, ‘cause hoes like to run game
Some niggas like to trick, but I ain't with that trickin' shit
I'm like a Jew, savin' dough so I can big whip
Pushin' a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get, I'm stayin' in the projects forever!
Jakes on the blocks — we out-clever
If beef, we never separate, roll together
When worst comes to worst, my peoples come first
Try to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt

Tumble out of bed and I stumble to the kitchen
Pour myself a cup of ambition
And yawn and stretch and try to come to life
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
Out on the street, the traffic starts jumpin'
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5

[Chorus]
Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
They just use your mind and they never give you credit
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it
9 to 5, for service and devotion
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me
Mmmm

[Verse 2]
They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter
You're just a step on the bossman's ladder
But you've got dreams he'll never take away
In the same boat with a lot of your friends
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way

She watched the sky as it bathes into black
Watched with the lovers that never came back
The princes and kings, all the beautiful things and more

She won't wait, she'll never look back
Through the morgue where the mirrors have crashed
She slides through a dream with all her beautiful schemes and more

Watch her go as she sings

Love is gold, time is a thief
She's the river that runs to the sea
With her arms open wide, a sorrowful smile and more

Still she wonders soaked to the bone
The road she's on, well, it won't lead her home
To the place she cried for the stranger inside and more

You don't know, so you just go
As far as you can go, but go slow, hey yo
Know this I've noticed

Seperating real from the fake and bogus
Sitting at the dock of the bay like Otis
We just slide, do this thing called life
Everything gon’ be alright
As you stay true to the path that’s inside

Gave him a call ""To the crib"" (Hello)
Would I still been known as the fellow
Rolling with the dude with the cello
What if these questions arise
As I look in my eyes
And I see my own surprise
Wondering what, path lies before me
Probably the same as the ones before me
And I, pass it right down to my seed

With that heavy-metal gaze they'll have to measure in tons
And when you look up at the sky
All you see are zeros
And all you see are zeros and ones
You took my hand and led me down to watch a kewpie doll parade
And we let the kittens lick our hair and drank our chalky lemonade
It's not that I just didn't care, I must admit I was afraid
And I'm awfully glad my finger's resting gently on the masterfade
The masterfade, I could have played along
The masterfade, I could have played Mah Jongg
But it just takes too long
And I just can't remember which way the east wind blows
Does it matter? If we're all matter
What's the matter?
Does it matter if we're all matter when we're done
When the sky is full of zeros and ones?

Sometimes, people just destined
Destined to do what they do
And that's what it is

If ever you awake and find your inner light is gray
May I suggest a simple remedy to make your day?
Open up your windows and then open wide your eyes
Let your vision feast upon the golden yellow sunrise
You might be aching 'cause the one you love is far away
Thinking it's impossible to make it through another day
You can feel better, take it from me
Just look at the colors of the falling autumn leaves
Let them put you at ease

[Chorus]
As long as we have the weather
The dark skies that bind us will send the clear day to remind us
As long as we have the weather
The sunlight will guide us and the rainbows will surely find us

[Verse 2]
God created changing seasons not in vain
The beauty of the weather's here for some distraction from our pain
Let a warm summer's night romance you
Let a winter's snow fall entrance you
You don't have to pay nothing to take in the view

[Bridge]
Let the winter winds blow your pain away
Let the blue sky be your secret getaway
I got the antidote to keep you cool
You should loosen up because nature has no rules

Remind me of the night before
A pounding pain in my head
I think I'll spend all day in bed

A thousand cigarettes went nuts
The stranger's hand in mine went white
Smudged lipstick, feeling sick
Make out, fall out, make up

Make out, fall out, make up, fall out

Dancing in the living room
With light supplied by the moon
Things I've said but shouldn't
Tricks I've tried but couldn't

Sorry if the music's too loud
Now the air is thicker than the cloud
Did I really call you
I was looking for someone I knew

In a faraway city with a faraway feel

Minor threat cannot decline

And I wanna dive in an ocean of pink tourmaline

Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
Stuck in the game
Me against the world, baby

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets
Though bodies is droppin' there ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children, 'cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard-headed bastard, maybe he'll listen in his casket
The aftermath: more bodies bein' buried
I'm losin' my homies in a hurry, they're relocatin' to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurry
The question is will I live, no one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses
'Cause this is how it is, what's the use?
Unless we're shootin', no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world, baby

[Verse 2: Yaki Kadafi]
Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself, see
Ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein' Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons
Already crazy and screamin', I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route for a crooked Outlaw?
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

[Verse 3: E.D.I. Mean]
Everyday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
Scheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'
'Cause ain't no bucks to stack up
My nuts is backed up, I'm about to act up
Go load the MAC up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'
And evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'
So what? Go put some work in and make my mail
Makin' sales, riskin' 25 with a L, but oh well

I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
[Verse 4: 2Pac]
With all this extra stressin'
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this oppression?
They punish the people that's askin' questions
And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons
Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let this pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothin' like the game; it's just me against the world
[Chorus: 2Pac & Puff Johnson]
Me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Got me stuck in the game (Ooh yeah)
It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose

Don't make sound, yes

Do a rain dance and your brain's still marsh

As for me, see, I just do how I love to do
Try to deny me of my props then I'll be seeing you
Most of you suckers wanna be down for the tag-along

Virgil Caine is my name and I drove on the Danville train
Till so much cavalry came and tore up the tracks again
In the winter of 'sixty-five, we were hungry, just barely alive
I took the train to Richmond that fell
It was a time I remember, oh, so well

[Chorus]
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the bells were ringin'
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singin'
They went:
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la

Back with my wife in Tennessee
And one day she said to me
Virgil, quick come see
There goes the Robert E. Lee
Now I don't mind chopping wood
And I don't care if the money's no good
Just take what you need and leave the rest
But they should never have taken the very best

Wanna make a new start with a fire inside of her

She couldn't stay around, everybody let her down
Stole the light and the life and the child inside of her
She's so alone

Take her far away from everything she knows
And the way they make her feel
She leaves today
Never look back never lose track already strong
She's seen too much at seventeen
The past will fade with the future that she craves

THE VAMPIRE IN LITERATURE

A consideration of the Vampire theme in literature must of necessity be somewhat eclectic, if not even arbitrary in the selection of works which it reviews and with which it sets out to deal. Any exhaustive inquiry is well-nigh impossible, and this not so much, perhaps, on account of the wealth of the material, although indeed there is a far vaster field than might generally be supposed, as owing to the very vague definition and indeterminate interpretation one is able to give to vampirism from a purely literary point of view. It is the craft of an artist in the telling of ghost-stories to see that his colours should not be too vivid and too clear, and no mean skill is required to suggest without explanation, to mass the shadows without derangement, to be occult yet not to be obscure. Accordingly it would be a matter of extreme difficulty to differentiate the malignant and death-dealing spectre or it may be even corpse who returns to wreak his foul revenge from the Vampire,--using this latter word in its widest sense, as one must employ it when speaking of literature, a caution which here given as regards this Chapter will serve once for all. In such a story, for example, as Dr. M. R. James' Count Magnus[1] is the horrible revenant a ghost or a vampire? The writer has left the point ambiguous. It is of the very essence of his happy invention that he should do so, and the deftly veiled incertitude adds to the loathly terror of the thing. It will be readily remembered that the story relates how a traveller in Sweden about the middle of the last century whilst staying near an ancient manor house in Vestergothland obtains permission to examine the family papers and among these he comes upon the traces of a certain Count Magnus de la Gardie who in the year 1600 had built the house or herrgård. Even after the lapse of two and a half centuries dark traditions are still lingering concerning this mysterious nobleman, whose body lies in a richly ornate copper sarcophagus that stands the principal feature of a domed mausoleum at the eastern end of the church. Reluctantly the landlord tells a story which happened in the time of his grandfather ninety-two years before. Two men determined to go at night and have a free hunt in the woods upon the estate. They are warned: ""No, do not go; we are sure you will meet with persons walking who should not be walking. They should be resting, not walking."" The two men laughed and cried: ""The Count is dead; we do not care for him."" But in the night the villagers ""hear someone scream, just as if the most inside part of his soul was twisted out of him."" Then they hear a hideous laugh, ""it was not one of those two men that laughed, and, indeed, they have all of them said that it was not any man at all."" In the morning they go out with the priest, and they find one of the men dead, killed in so terrible a fashion that they buried him on the spot. ""He was once a beautiful man, but now his face was not there, because the flesh of it was sucked away off the bones."" The other man is standing with his back against a tree, ""pushing with his hands-pushing something away from him which was not there.""

There was some vague gossip that the Count had been ""on the Black Pilgrimage, and had brought something or someone back with him."" During his investigation of the papers the English traveller, Mr. Wraxall, found a Liber nigrae peregrinationis, or at least a few lines of such a document indicating that the Count had once journeyed to the city of Chorazin and there adored the prince of the air. In careless mood as he is passing near the mausoleum, Mr. Wraxall exclaims: ""Ah, Count Magnus, there you are. I should dearly like to see you."" He is indiscreet enough to cry out thus flippantly on two further occasions, and at last he is thoroughly alarmed by hearing the sound of metal hinges creaking and he knows that the sarcophagus is slowly opening wide. In a state of frenzied fear he sets out for England the next day, yet turn and double as he will he is everywhere haunted by two hideous figures, a man in a long black cloak and a broad-leafed hat and something in a dark cloak and hood. Upon landing at Harwich he makes his way across country to a neighbouring village, when on looking out of the carriage window he sees at a cross-road the two horrible creatures. He finds a lodging, but within the next forty-eight hours his pursuers fall upon him. He is discovered dead, and in the district it is still remembered how ""the jury that viewed the body fainted, seven of 'em did, and none of 'em wouldn't speak to what they see, and the verdict was visitation of God; and how the people as kep' the 'ouse moved out that same week and went away from that part.""

This story may, I think, certainly be considered as Vampire lore, and although it must, of course, be perfectly familiar to all who delight in tales of the supernatural I have related it at some little length here, partly because it is told so excellently well, and partly because it so admirably fulfils and exemplifies the qualities that this kind of literature should possess. It is brief and succinct, although there are many details, but every touch tells. No ghost story should be of any length. The horror and the awe evaporate with prolixity. The ghost is malevolent and odious. In fiction a helpful apparition is a notable weakness, and the whole narrative becomes flabby to a degree. The authentic note of horror is struck in the eerie suggestion which, as we have noticed, is of intent left ill-defined. Nothing could be more crude than an explanation, and it is this banality that often ruins a story which otherwise might be of the very first order.

To review the traces of vampire legends which appear in sagas, and which are in truth but few and unimportant, seems to be outside our province here, and even more foreign to our purpose would be the present examination of the vampire legend in folk-lore since this has already been dealt with in the course of the preceding chapters, and to regard such traditions merely as literature would be not only to look at them from a wrong perspective but to misrepresent their quality and essentially to pervert their purpose.

Since some point must be chosen at which to consider vampirism in literature we may most fairly recall to mind the many academic and philosophical treatises upon the Vampire which were rehearsed and discussed in German Universities during the earlier part of the eighteenth century, and these startling themes soon began to attract the attention of poets and literary men. Thus among the poems of Heinrich August Ossenfelder[2] we have a short piece entitled Der Vampir, which is as follows:

Mein liebes Mägdchen glaubet
Beständig steif und feste,
An die gegebnen Lehren
Der immer frommen Mutter
Als Völker an der Theyse
An tödtliche Vampiere
Heyduckisch feste glauben,
Nun warte nur Christianchen,
Du willst mich gar nich lieben;
Ich will mich an dir rächen,
Und heute in Tockayer
Zu einem Vampir trinken.
Und wenn du sanfte schlummerst,
Von deinen schönen Wangen
Den frischen Purpur saugen.
Alsdenn wirst du erschrecken,
Wenn ich dich werde küssen
Und als ein Vampir küssen:
Wann du dann recht erzitterst
Und matt in meine Arme,
Gleich einer Todten sinkest
Alsdenn will ich dich fragen,
Sind meine Lehren besser,
Als deiner guten Mutter?
The poet Wieland[3] has a passing reference to the Vampire

Der Jüngling aus den Wolken
Herab gefallen, stumm und bleich,
Als hätt' ein Vampyr ihm die Adern ausgemolken,
Steht ganz vernichtet von dem Streich.[4]

It would be an exaggeration to say that the Vampire entered German literature with Goethe's famous ballad Die Braut von Korinth, but it would be difficult to over-estimate the influence and the popularity of this piece, the subject of which is directly derived from Phlegon of Tralles. The young Athenian who visits his father's old friend to whose daughter he has been betrothed receives at midnight the Vampire body of the girl whom death has prevented from becoming his bride, and who declares:

Aus dem Grabe werd' ich ausgetrieben,
Noch zu suchen das vermifste Gut,
Noch den schon verlornen Mann zu lieben Und zu saugen seines Herzens Blut.
Ist's um den geschehn,
Muss nach andern gehn,
Und das junge Volk erliegt der Wut.[6]

Even more famous are the charnel horrors of Bürger's Lenore which was first printed in 1773 in the Gottinger Musenalmanach and which notwithstanding the legions of hostile comments and parodies whereof Brandl gives an ample list[6] has remained a household word.

In spite of the immense enthusiasm at that date in contemporary England for German romantic literature it is remarkable that no translation of Lenore was published here until 1796, when William Taylor of Norwich printed in the Monthly Review of March his rendering which in some respects must be called an adaptation. He had, however, by his own account written the translation as early as 1790,[7] and there can be no doubt that very shortly after its completion it was declaimed, applauded and much discussed in Norwich literary circles. We know that Mrs. Barbauld who visited Edinburgh ""about the summer of 1793 or 1794""[8] read aloud Taylor's version to a number of enthusiastic admirers. This event was described to Sir Walter Scott by Miss Cranstoun, afterwards Countess Purgstall,[9] although Scott himself mentions that his curiosity ""was first attracted to this truly romantic story by a gentleman, who, having heard Lenore once read in manuscript, could only recollect the general outline, and part of a couplet, which, from the singularity of its structure, and frequent recurrence,[10] had remained impressed on his memory.""[11] This gentleman Was Mr. Cranstoun, the brother of Countess Purgstall, and so her statement is no doubt accurate as Scott might well have received his account both from the brother as well as from the sister. It was in the course of 1794, or at any rate early in the following year that Scott made his own rendering of the ballad. The account of Taylor's version, Ellenore, which ""electrified"" the assembled company at Dugald Stewart's house when read by the famous Anna Letitia Barbauld had given him the strongest desire to see the original. Just about this time, however, it was a difficult matter to procure books from the continent, and it was not until after some delay that a copy of Bürger's works was conveyed to him from Hamburg. He immediately devoured the German ballad and was so impressed that he forthwith set about Englishing it. ""I well recollect"" he writes, ""that I began my task after supper, and finished it about daybreak next morning.""[12] Scott's friends privately printed a few copies of the poem as a surprise for the author,"" and as it went from hand to hand it met with the most flattering reception. In 1796, besides the public issue of the translations from Bürger by Taylor and by Scott, no less than three other versions appeared, from the several pens of W. R. Spencer, H. J. Pye and J. T. Stanley. The translation by the last named author was given to the public in an édition de luxe at five shillings, as well as in the ordinary edition of half a crown.[14] In 1797, a pasquil followed, Miss Kitty: a Parody on Lenora, a Ballad, ""Translated from the German, by several Hands,"" whilst in the following year, Mrs. Taylor turned the popular poem into Italian as a ""Novella Morale.""[15] Probably the most faithful, if not the most spirited translation, was that by the Rev. J. Beresford which was published in 1800.

It was in 1797 that Coleridge wrote the first part of Christabel, and German critics have somewhat superfluously endeavoured to emphasize herein the influence of Lenore, since upon examination it would hardly seem that such is present even in the smallest degree. For example, if the narrative of Geraldine be carefully read[16] it must be evident that the following judgment of Professor Brandl is without foundation. This critic writes: ""Ihre Vorgeschichte (of Geraldine) schöpfte er grossentheils aus Bürgers 'Lenore' in Taylors Uebersetzung: die Dame ist, wenigstens ihrer Erzählung nach, auf einem windschnellen Ross entführt und halbtodt vor Furcht hier abgesetzt worden; statt des schwarzen Leichenzuges, der Lenoren auf ihrem Ritt durch die Mondnacht aufstiess, will sie 'den Schatten der Nacht' gekreuzt haben; noch zittert das verdorrte Blatt neben ihr wie aus Herzenangst.""[17]

As we might expect, the young Shelley was enchanted by Lenore, and Medwin relates how the poet long treasured cc a copy of the whole poem, which he made with his own hand.""[18] Dowden tells the story how one Christmas Eve Shelley dramatically related the Bürger ballad with appropriate intonation and gesture ""working up the horror to such a height of fearful interest ""that the company fully expected to see Wilhelm stalk into the parlour."" In his study of Shelley, Charles Middleton has remarked: ""It is hinted, somewhat plausibly, that the Leonora of Bürgher first awakened his poetic faculty. A tale of such beauty and terror might well have kindled his lively imagination, but his earliest pieces, written about this time, and consisting only of a few ballads, are deficient in elegance and originality, and give no evidence whatever of the genius which soon after declared itself.""[20] To suggest, as Zeiger would have it,[21] that Lenore influenced the poem which in the romance St. Irvyne[22] Megalina inscribes on the wall of her prison, and which commences:

Ghosts of the dead! have I not heard your yelling
Rise on the night-rolling breast of the blast, . . .
is the merest ineptitude, since these verses are taken almost word for word from ""Lachin y Gair"" in Byron's Hours of Idleness, and that had been published some four years previously.[23]

As I have elsewhere shown in some detail, Shelley's two juvenile romances owe not only their inspiration but a great deal of their phrasing and noctivagations to Charlotte Dacre's Zofloya: or The Moor, which appeared in 1806, and which, as the poet himself declares ""quite enraptured"" him.[24] It is a very remarkable circumstance that in spite of the extremely plain hint which might profitably have been taken from such poems as Die Braut von Korinth and Lenore the novelists of the Gothic school, soaked though they were in German literature, searching the earth and the depths of the earth for thrills and sensation of every kind, do not seem to have utilized the tradition of the Vampire. It is a puzzle indeed if we ask how it was that such writers as Monk Lewis, ""Apollo's sexton,"" who would fain ""make Parnassus a churchyard"";[25] and Charles Robert Maturin who, as he himself confessed, loved bells rung by viewless hands, daggers encrusted with long shed blood, treacherous doors behind still more treacherous tapestry, mad nuns, apparitions,[26] et hoc genus omne; the two lords of macabre romance, should neither of them have sent some hideous vampire ghost ravening through their sepulchral pages. In the Gothic romance we have horror heaped on horror's head; mouldering abbeys, haunted castles, banditti, illuminati, sorcerers, conspirators, murderous monks and phantom friars, apparitions without number until the despairing reviewers cried aloud: ""Surely the misses themselves must be tired of so many stories of ghosts and murders."" We have such titles as the famous Horrid Mysteries; The Midnight Groan; The Abbot of Montserrat, or, The Pool of Blood; The Demon of Venice; The Convent Spectre; The Hag of the Mountains;[27] and a hundred such lurid nomenclatures, but until we come to Polidori's novel which will be considered later, nowhere, so far as I am aware, do we meet with the Vampire in the realm of Gothic fancy. So vast, however, is this fascinating library and so difficult to procure are these novels of a century and a quarter ago that I hesitate sweepingly to assert that this theme was entirely unexploited. There may be some romance which I have not had the good fortune to find where a hideous vampire swoops down upon his victims, but if such be the case I am at least prepared to say that the Vampire was not generally known to Gothic lore, and had his presence made itself felt in the sombre chapters of one votary of this school I think he would have re-appeared on many occasions, for the writers were as accustomed to convey from one another with an easy assurance, as they were wont deftly to plunder the foreign mines. Inevitably one of the band, T. J. Horseley Carties, Francis Lathom, William Herbert, Edward Montague, Mrs. Roche, Eliza Parsons, Miss M. Hamilton, Mrs. Helme, Mrs. Meeke, Isabella Kelley, and many another beside insatiably agog for horrid phantasmagoria would have utilized the Vampire in some funereal episode.

One might even have supposed that the notes to Southey's Thalaba the Destroyer,[28] must have put them on the track, and surely stanzas eight, nine and ten in Book VIII could not have passed unnoticed:

A night of darkness and of storms!
Into the Chamber of the Tomb
Thalaba led the Old Man,
To roof him from the rain.
A night of storms! the wind
Swept through the moonless sky,
And moan'd among the pillar'd sepulchres;
And in the pauses if its sweep
They heard the heavy rain
Beat on the monument above.
In silence on Oneiza's grave
Her father and her husband sate.
The Cryer from the Minaret
Proclaim'd the midnight hour.
""Now, now!"" cried Thalaba;
And o'er the chamber of the tomb
There spread a lurid gleam,
Like the reflection of a sulphur fire
And in that hideous light
Oneiza stood before them. It was She . . .
Her very lineaments. . . . and such as death
Had changed them, livid cheeks and lips of blue;
But in her eye there dwelt
Brightness more terrible
Than all the loathsomeness of death.
""Still art thou living, wretch? ""
In hollow tones she cried to Thalaba;
""And must I nightly leave my grave
To tell thee, still in vain,
God hath abandoned thee?
""This is not she!"" the Old Man exclaim'd;
""A Fiend; a manifest Fiend!""
And to the youth he held his lance;
""Strike and deliver thyself!""
""Strike HER!"" cried Thalaba,
And palsied of all power,
Gazed fixedly upon the dreadful form.
""Yea, strike her!"" cried a voice, whose tones
Flow'd with such a sudden healing through his soul,
As when the desert shower
From death deliver'd him;
But obedient to that well-known voice,
His eye was seeking it,
When Moath, firm of heart,
Perform 'd the bidding: through the vampire corpse
He thrust his lance; it fell,
And howling with the wound,
Its fiendish tenant fled.
A sapphire light fell on them,
And garmented with glory, in their sight
Oneiza's spirit stood.

It is important to remark that in his notes[29] upon this passage Southey cites at considerable length various cases of vampirism, particularly from the Lettres Juives, the Vampires of Gradisch, also the history of Arnold Paul, and the very ample account given by Tournefort. He further says: ""The Turks have an opinion that men that are buried have a sort of life in their graves. If any man makes affidavit before a judge, that he heard a noise in a man's grave, he [i.e., the body] is, by order, dug up and chopped all too pieces. The merchants (at Constantinople) once airing on horseback, had, as usual, for protection, a Janisary with them. Passing by the burying place of the Jews, it happened that an old Jew sat by a sepulchre. The Janisary rode up to him, and rated him for stinking the world a second time, and commanded him to get into his grave again--Roger North's Life of Sir Dudley North.""[30]

It might perhaps not unfairly be argued that the two notorious romances of the Marquis de Sade Justine, on les Malheurs de la Vertu and Juliette depict scenes of vampirism, and if we are to take the word in any extended sense this is certainly the case. In the first place it must be remembered that as it passed through various editions-it was first issued in 1791, 2 vols., 8vo,--until it appeared in its final and complete form in 1797 as La Nouvelle Justine, on les Malheurs de la Vertu, suivie de l'Histoire de Juliette, sa soeur, 10 vols., 18mo (of which Justine occupies four and Juliette six) Justine was added to and augmented until the last version is practically double the length of the first, and the book has been entirely re-written. In Justine we have the episodes in the house of Monsieur Rodin, and more particularly the orgies of the Comte de Gernade who takes a lustful pleasure in watching the blood flow from the veins of his victims, as also the cruelties of the monster Roland all of which. may well be esteemed vampirism. Many similar scenes are described with great prolixity in Juliette, and this romance is distinguished by such horrible figures as the Muscovite giant Minski, whose favourite meat is human flesh, and in whose castle the table and chairs are made of bleaching bones, and Cordelli, the necrophilist of Ancona.

In The New Monthly Magazine,[31] 1 April, 1819, was published The Vampyre: a Tale by Lord Byron, which although it may seem to us--steeped in Le Fanu and M. R. James--a little old-fashioned, at the time created an immense sensation and had the most extraordinary influence, being even more admired and imitated on the Continent than in England. It was almost immediately known that actually the story did not come from the pen of Lord Byron, but had been written by Dr. John William Polidori, physician-companion to the poet. Byron had, as a matter of fact, been writing a work of the same title in imitation of Mrs. Shelley's Frankenstein, but he denied the authorship of this piece in the famous letter facsimilied in Galignani's edition of his works. A first printed, The Vampyre forms a part of extracts from ""A letter from Geneva, with Anecdotes of Lord Byron."" Here is to be read that ""among other things which the lady, from whom I procured these anecdotes, related to me, she mentioned the outline of a ghost story by Lord Byron. It appears that one evening Lord Byron, Mr. p. B. Shelley, the two ladies and the gentleman (the daughters of Godwin and Dr. Polidori) before alluded to after having perused a German work, which was entitled Phantasmagoriana[32] began relating ghost stories; when his lordship having recited the beginning of Christabel, then unpublished, the whole took so strong a hold of Mr. Shelley's mind, that he suddenly started up and ran out of the room. The physician and Lord Byron followed, and discovered him leaning against a mantlepiece with cold drops of perspiration trickling down his face. After having given him something to refresh him, upon enquiring into the cause of his alarm, they found that his wild imagination having pictured to him the bosom of one of the ladies with eyes (which was reported of a lady in the neighbourhood where he lived) he was obliged to leave the room in order to destroy the impression. It was afterwards proposed in the course of conversation, that each of the company present should write a tale depending upon some supernatural agency, which was undertaken by Lord Byron, the physician, and Miss M. Godwin. My friend, the lady above referred to, had in her possession the outline of each of these stories, I obtained them as a great favour, and herewith forward them to you, as I was assured you would feel as much curiosity as myself, to peruse the ébauches of so great a genius, and those immediately under his influence."" Upon this the Editor has the following note: ""We have in our possession the Tale of Dr. ------ as well as the outline of that of Miss Godwin. The latter has already appeared under the title of 'Frankenstein, or the modern Prometheus'; the former, however, upon consulting this author, we may, probably, hereafter give to our readers.""

The Vampyre is introduced by several paragraphs which deal with the tradition. This preamble commences: ""The superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabians it appears to be common; it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human bloodsuckers fattened--and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.""

The Editor then recounts the famous instance of Arnold Paul, and continues: ""We have related this monstrous rodomontade, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance we could adduce. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is doomed to vampyrise, but be compelled to confine his visitations solely to those beings he loved most while on earth-those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection. This supposition is, we imagine, alluded to in the following fearfully sublime and prophetic curse from the 'Giaour.'[32]

But first on earth, as Vampyre sent,
Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent;
Then ghastly haunt thy native place,
And suck the blood of all thy race;
There from thy daughter, sister, wife, p. 283
At midnight drain the stream of life;
Yet loathe the banquet, which perforce
Must feed thy livid living corse,
Thy victims, ere they yet expire,
Shall know the demon for their sire;
As cursing thee, thou cursing them,
Thy flowers are withered on the stem.
But one that for thy crime must fall,
The youngest, best beloved of all,
Shall bless thee with a father's name--
That word shall wrap thy heart in flame!
Yet thou must end thy task and mark
Her check's last tinge--her eye's last spark,
And the last glassy glance must view
Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue;
Then with unhallowed hand shall tear
The tresses of her yellow hair,
Of which, in life a lock when shorn
Affection's fondest pledge was worn--
But now is borne away by thee
Memorial o thine agony!
Yet with thine own best blood shall drip
Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip;
Then stalking to thy sullen grave
Go--and with Ghouls and Afrits rave,
Till these in horror shrink away
From spectre more accursed than they.""

After an allusion to Southey's Thalaba, Tournefort's Travels, and Dom Calmet's classical work, the editor concludes: ""We could add many curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition, and we may, perhaps, resume our observations upon it at some future opportunity; for the present, we feel that we have very far exceeded the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to the explanation of the strange production to which we now invite the attention of our readers; and we shall therefore conclude by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several other synonimous with it, which are made use of in various parts of the world, namely, Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.""

The story tells how at the height of a London season there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose; some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward working of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass."" This original is invited to every house, and in the course of the winter he meets ""a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey"" he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood."" Aubrey is greatly fascinated by Lord Ruthven, for this is the name of the mysterious nobleman, and intending to travel upon the Continent he mentions this intention to my Lord, and is ""surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.""

As they travelled from town to town, Aubrey notices the peculiar conduct of his companion who bestows largess upon the most worthless characters, broken gamblers and the like, but refuses a doit to the deserving and virtuous poor. However the recipients of this charity ""inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they all were either led to the scaffold or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery."" Eventually the travellers arrive at Rome, and here Aubrey receives letters from his guardians who require him immediately to leave his companion as since their departure from London the most terrible scandals, adulteries and seductions, have come to light. At Rome Aubrey is able to foil Lord Ruthven's plans, frustrating an intrigue designed to ruin a heedless young girl, and then he ""directed his steps towards Greece, and, crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens."" Here he lodges in the house of a Greek, whose daughter Ianthe is a paragon of the most exquisite beauty. As he sketches the ruins of the city she is wont to entertain him with Greek legend and tradition, and ""often, as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heart-breaking to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.""

Before long it becomes evident that Aubrey is in love with Ianthe, ""and while he ridicules the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy form before him."" He endeavours to occupy his time with antiquarian excursions which lead him farther and farther afield, and at length he determines to proceed to a point beyond any he has as yet visited. When Ianthe's parents hear the name of the place he proposes to visit they most earnestly implore him on no account to return when once dusk has fallen, ""as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.""

Having given his promise to Ianthe that he will be back well before evening he sets out very early. The exploration, however, takes longer than he has supposed, and when he turns his horse homeward the darkness is already hurrying on urged by a terrific storm. The steed, alarmed at the battle of the elements dashes off at breakneck pace and only halts trembling and tired before a distant hovel in the heart of a solitary wood. ""As he approached, the thunder, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stiffled exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound."" With a terrific effort Aubrey burst open the door and rushing into the darkness ""found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized, when a voice cried ""again baffled,"" to which a loud laugh succeeded, and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled but it was in vain; he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground; his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hand upon his throat, when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him--he instantly rose and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood was not longer heard."" Several peasants now hastened into the hut bearing flambeaus which illuminate the scene, and to the horror of all there is discovered hard by, the lifeless body of Ianthe. A curious dagger lies near, but her death was not the result of a blow from this weapon. ""There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:--upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:--to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, 'a Vampyre, a Vampyre!'"" It appears that Ianthe had followed the traveller to watch over his safety. Aubrey is carried back to the city in a raging fever, and the parents of the unfortunate girl die brokenhearted owing to so terrible a loss.

Whilst Aubrey lies ill Lord Ruthven arrives in Athens and establishing himself in the same house nurses the invalid with such care that past differences are forgotten, since Aubrey not only becomes reconciled to his presence but even seeks his company. Together they travel into the wildest interior of Greece, and here in some mountain pass they are attacked by brigands, from whose guns Lord Ruthven receives a shot in the shoulder. His strength strangely decreasing, a couple of days later it is plain to all that he is at the point of death. He now exacts a terrific oath that his companion shall conceal all that is known of him and that the news of his death shall not be allowed to reach England. ""Swear!"" cried the dying man, ""Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see."" Aubrey binds himself most solemnly by the prescribed oath, and in a paroxysm of hideous laughter Ruthven expires.

According to a promise which has been obtained from the robbers by a heavy bribe the body was conveyed to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon which rose after his death. Aubrey insists that it shall be interred in the ordinary way, but when he is conducted to the place it is found that the body has disappeared, and in spite of the protestations of the band he is convinced that they have buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes. One circumstance, however, gives Aubrey much food for thought. Among the effects of the deceased he discovered a sheath of most curious pattern and make which exactly fits the dagger that had been found in the deserted hut upon the occasion of Ianthe's death.

Returning to England, as he retraces his journey through Rome to his horror Aubrey discovers that in spite of the precautions he had so carefully taken, Lord Ruthven succeeded only too well in his bad designs and now there is bitter sorrow and distress where once reigned peace and happiness. The lady had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship, and Aubrey instinctively divines that she has ""fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe.""

Upon his arrival in London the traveller is greeted by his sister, whose presentation into society had been delayed until her brother's return from the Continent, when he might be her protector. ""It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the busy scene."" Upon this gay occasion the crowd was excessive, and as Aubrey heedless and distracted is watching the gay throng a voice which he recognizes only too well, whispers in this ear: ""Remember

p. 288

your oath."" Turning he sees Lord Ruthven standing near him. A few nights later at the assembly of a near relation among the crowd of admirers by whom his sister is surrounded--the most prominent of the throng--he again perceives the mysterious and horrible figure. Hurrying forward he seizes his sister's arm and requests her immediately to accompany him home. However, before they have had time to retire again does the voice whisper close to him: ""Remember your oath!""

Aubrey now becomes almost distracted. He sees no remedy against a monster who has already once mocked at death. Even if he were to declare all that he knew it is probable that he would hardly be believed. Whenever he attends a social gathering his looks as he scans the company become so suspicious and strange that he soon acquires a reputation for great eccentricity. As the months go on his loathing and his fears drive him well-nigh to madness, so that eventually a physician is engaged to reside in the house and take charge of him. He is a little consoled by the thought that when the year and the day have passed he will at least be able to unburden his mind and be at any rate freed from his terrible oath. It so happens that he overhears a conversation between the doctor and one of his guardians who enlarges upon the melancholy circumstance of her brother being in so critical a state when Miss Aubrey is to be married on the following day. He instantly demands the name of the bridegroom and is told the Earl of Marsden. He requests to see his sister and in an hour or two she visits him. As they are conversing she opens a locket and shows him a miniature of the man who has won her affections. To his horror he perceives that it is a portrait of Lord Ruthven and falling into convulsions of rage he tramples it under foot. In twenty-four hours the period of his oath will have expired, and he implores them to delay the wedding at least for that time. Since there seems no good reason for doing this the request is disregarded, upon which Aubrey falls into so sad a state of utter depression succeeded by an outburst of fury that the physician concludes him to be not far removed from lunacy and doubles the restraint. During the night the busy preparations for the nuptial are ceaselessly continued. It appears that upon the pretext of being her brother's dearest friend and travelling

p. 289

companion Lord Ruthven had visited the house to inquire after Aubrey during his supposed derangement, and from the character of a visitor gradually insinuated himself into that of an accepted suitor. When the bridal party has assembled Aubrey, neglected by the servants, contrives to make his way into the public apartments which are decorated for the nuptials. Ere he can utter a cry, he is, however, at once perceived by Lord Ruthven who with more than human strength thrusts him, speechless with rage, from the room, at the same time whispering in his ear: ""Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to-day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!"" The attendants at once secure the unhappy man, but he can no longer support his distress. In his agonies a blood vessel breaks and he is incontinently conveyed to bed. This sad accident is kept from his sister; the marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.

""Aubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused--he died immediately after.

""The guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a Vampyre!""

It were not easy to overestimate the astounding sensation which was caused by this story, and the narrative is certainly not without considerable merit, for in places the eerie atmosphere is well conveyed, Nor is it difficult to understand the extraordinary influence of the tale, since it introduced a tradition which had been long forgotten and which promised infinite possibilities in the way of that sensation and melodramatic calentures which the period craved. The first separate edition of The Vampyre appeared in 1819, and was published by Sherwood. The first issue of this, which is now very rare, contains a certain amount of preliminary matter concerning the Shelleys, Byron and Godwin. This was omitted in later issues, and accordingly one often finds that copies of The Vampyre are described as First Edition, which is strictly quite correct, although they are the Second Issue,

p. 290

and naturally of far less value in a bibliographer's eyes. A large number of reprints increased with amazing rapidity and in the same year the novel was translated into French by Henri Faber, Le Vampire, nouvelle traduite de l'anglais de Lord Byron, Paris, 1819. In February, 1820, there followed under the aegis of Charles Nodier a very obvious imitation, or rather continuation by Cyprien Bérard, Lord Ruthwen ou les Vampires. ""Roman de C. B. Publié par l'auteur de Jean Sbogar et de Thérèse Aubert.[34] Paris, 1820."" In 1825, a new translation of Polidori's story was given by Eusèbe de Salles. Nor was Germany behind hand, for The Vampyre was first translated in 1819: Der Vampyr. Eine Erzahlung aus dem Englischen des Lord Byron. Nebst einer Schilderung seines Aufenthaltes in Mytilene. Leipzig, 1819. In the following year there appeared at Frankfort a version by J. V. Adrian of Byron's poems and prose, wherein was included Der Blutsuger. In a collection of Byron's work the first volume of which was published at Zwickau in 1821, The Vampyre again found a place in volume V (1821), translated by Christian Karl Meifsner as Der Vampyr. The tale has also been included in various other continental collections and translations of Byron's work even until a recent date.

Yet it was well-known all the while that Polidori was the author of the story, but as Byron's was by far the greater name, so this sensational novella must be attributed to the cavaliero whose romantic adventures and the scandal of whose amours were thrilling the whole of Europe. Writing in the same Year as the great poet's death Amédée Pichot of the University of Marseilles in his Essai sur le génie et le caractère de Lord Byron[35] declared that this spurious issue ""a autant contribué à faire connaître le nom de lord Byron en France, que ses poëmes les plus estimés."" Publishers insisted upon Le Vampire, ""nouvelle,"" being included among Byron's works, and it is said that Ladvocat was furious when it was represented to him that since it was openly acknowledged that Polidori had written The Vampire, the translation should properly be no longer given among the poet's work nor put forth under his name.

As might have been expected it was not long before the Vampire appeared upon the stage, and the first play of this kind would seem to be the famous melodrama by Charles

p. 291

Nodier (with Achille Jouffroy and Carmouche) which with music by Alexandre Piccini and scenery by Ciceri, was produced in Paris on 13th June, 1820, at the Théâtre de la Porte-Saint-Martin, whose directors were the popular M. M. Croznier and Merle. The rôle of Lord Rutwen was taken by M. Philippe; the celebrated Madame Dorval was Malvina;[36] and the new play had an extraordinary success.

It was immediately published as Le Vampire, mélodrame en trois actes avec un prologue, Par M. M. . . .; Musique, de M. Alexandre Piccini; Decors de M. Ciceri. This might be purchased at 1 fr. 25cs. ""au magasin général de pièces de Théâtre, Chez J.-N. Barba, Libraire, Palais Royal, derrière le Théâtre Français, No. 51. ""The characters in the Prologue are Ituriel, ange de la Lune, Mlle. Descotte; Oscar, génie des Mariages, M. Moëssard; and Un Vampire, M. Philippe. The scene opens in ""une grotte basaltique,"" the Caledonian caves of Staffa. Oscar and Ituriel discourse of Vampires, and the latter asks: ""Serait-il vrai que d'horribles fantômes viennent quelquefois, sous l'apparence des droits de l'hymen, égorger une vierge timide, et s'abreuver de son sang?"" This is indeed the case, and it is significant that on the morrow Malvina (Miss Aubray) is to wed ""le comte de Marsden."" A vision of the sleeping Malvina appears when ""Un spectre vêtu d'un linceuil s'échappe de la plus apparente de ces tombes"" and rushes upon her. He is swiftly repulsed by Oscar, the good genius and the curtain falls. The characters in the play are: Lord Rutwen, M. Philippe; Sir Aubray, M. Perrin ou Théringy; Malvina, Mad. Dorval; Brigitte, Mad. St. Amand; Edgar, M. Edmon; Scop, M. Pierson; Petterson, M. Dugy; Lovette, Mlle. J. Vertpré; Oscar, M. Moëssard; with attendances of Domestiques and Villageois. The drama to a certain extent adroitly follows the lines of the Polidori novel, but with notable changes, which are well contrived and introduced. Lord Rutwen and Aubray have been fellow travellers, but the latter has no suspicion of Rutwen's real nature. In fact he holds him in the dearest affection since once he was saved from death by his friend who, whilst shielding him from a brigand's attack, fell by a chance shot. When Lord Rutwen arrives to claim Malvina's hand it is with delight Aubray hails his preserver on whom he supposed killed by the bandit's gun. It is cleverly explained how

p. 292

the wound did not after all prove fatal, whereupon ""Rutwen, mes desirs sont remplis"" cries Aubray, ""nous allons être frères"" (Ils s'embrassent). Lovette a farmer's daughter of the Marsden estate is to wed Edgar, and Rutwen graciously presents himself at the marriage feast. As Lord of the Manor he is received with every respect and homage, but he immediately proceeds to attempt Lovette's virtue. Oscar ""un viellard dont la tête vénérable inspire le respect. Sa démarche a quelque chose d'imposant et de mystérieux,"" has already warned the maiden, and she coldly avoids such ardent importunities. Whilst Rutwen is actually pursuing the coy lass who shuns his embrace, Edgar in a fury fires a pistol at the seducer and he falls crying, ""Je meurs."" Aubray hastening to the spot is barely in time to receive him in his arms, and with dying lips Rutwen adjures him to swear the following oath. ""Promets-moi que Malvina ne saura point ce qui m'est arrivé; que tu ne feras rien pour venger ma mort avant que la première heure de la nuit n'ait sonné. Jure-moi le secret sur ce coeur expirant."" Aubray much moved cries, ""Je to le jure,"" and as Rutwen expires they lay the body gently on the ground. ""A`ce moment on voit la lune planer entièrement sur le corps de Rutwen, et éclairer les glaçons de la montagne. La toile tombe.""

Act III. ""représente un grand vestibule gothique, la porte de la chapelle se voit au fond."" Oscar solemnly utters words of warning to Brigitte, who is already full of fears which are not unnoticed by Malvina. When Aubray meets his sister she speaks joyfully of her marriage but as he is about to tell her of the fatal happening suddenly Rutwen appears and seizing his arm ""lui dit d'une voix sombre: 'Songe à ton serment'!"" Aubray now realizes that there is some horrid secret and displays violent emotion crying out in broken tones: ""Eloigne-toi fantôme! . . ma soeur . . . dérobe-toi, aux poursuites de ce monstre . . . il te dira qu'il est ton époux . . . refuse ton serment . . . cet hymen est un crime"" At length he is carried off by the servants who fear that he has lost his senses, an idea Rutwen encourages. In spite of this disorder the bridegroom now hotly presses on the nuptials; the great doors are opened ""et laisse voir la chapelle éclairée,"" Rutwen and Malvina approach the altar. With a wild cry Aubray rushes in to intercept the ceremony,

p. 293

upon which the monster drawing his dagger is about to plunge it deep into Malvina's heart when one o'clock strikes,--his power is gone."" Il laisse tomber son poignard et cherche & s'enfuir, des ombres sortent de la terre et l'entraînent avec elles; l'Ange exterminateur paraît dans un nuage, la foudre éclate et les Ombres s'engloutissent avec Rutwen. Pluie de feu. TABLEAU GÉNÉRAL.""

The dialogue of this melodrama is spirited, the situations striking and well managed, and even in reading the play, one can clearly visualize that upon the stage it must have been extraordinarily effective, especially when set off with all the attractions of the scene painter's glowing perspectives, the magic craft of the subtle machinist, and the richest adornment of romantic costume.[37] Even before he had introduced the Vampire on to the boards Nodier had prophesied that this macabre monster would win a veritable triumph, and his prediction was amply fulfilled. ""Le Vampire épouvantera, de son horrible amour, les songes de toutes les femmes, et bientôt sans doute, ce monstre encore exhumé prêtera son masque immobile, sa voix sépulcrale, son oeil d'un gris mort, . . . tout cet attirail de mélodrame à la Melpomène des boulevards; et quel succès alors ne lui est pas réservé!""[38] On 1st July, 1819, writing in the Drapeau Blanc he was far more serious and far more emphatic: ""La fable du vampire est peut-être la plus universelle de nos superstitions. . . Elle a partout l'autorité de la tradition: elle ne manque ni de celle de la théologie ni do celle de la, médicine. La philosophie même en a parlé.""

All Paris flocked to see Le Vampire, and nightly the Porte-Saint-Martin was packed to the doors. Philippe and Madame Dorval were applauded to the echo by enthusiastic audiences who recalled them again and again after the final tableau. Even the book of the play had an immense circulation and every morning Barba's counter was freshly stocked with huge piles of the duodecimo, which rapidly diminished during the day.

Not a few critics, however, adopted a very uncompromising attitude, and were unsparing in their condemnation of so popular a melodrama. In Les Lettres Normandes, 1820, (tome XI, p. 93) Le Vampire was thus noticed: ""Le mélodrame du Vampire dans lequel on voit paraître un monstre

p. 294

qui suce le sang des petites filles et qui offre des Tableaux qu'une honnête femme ne pout voir sans rougir, est l'ouvrage de MM. Ch. Nodier, rédacteur du Drapeau Blanc; Achille Jouffroy, rédacteur de La Gazette et auteur des Festes de l'anarchie; et Carmouche autre rédacteur du Drapeau Blanc."" This censure is, however, wholly inspired by political feeling which thus inveighed against the royalist Nodier, and which not unmingled with green jealousy we also find prominent in the Conservateur littéraire of April, 1820 (Tome II, p. 245) where we had: ""Pour balancer le succès du Vampire mélodrame dégoûtant et si monstreux que les auteurs MM. Ch. Nodier et Carmouche m'ont pas osé se faire connaître, le théâtre de la Porte-Saint-Martin se prépare à représenter la traduction littérale, en prose, de la Marie Stuart de Schiller.""

Yet another critic is even more trenchant and severe: ""Le Vampire Ruthwen veut violer ou sucer dans les coulisses une jeune fiancée qui fuit devant lui sur le théâtre: cette situation est-elle morale? . . . Toute la pièce représente indirectement Dieu comme un être faible ou odieux qui abandonne le monde aux génies de l'enfer.""[39]

Yet all these attacks served but to enhance the attraction, and it is remarkable for how many years this continued undiminished. In 1823 a revival of Le Vampire with Philippe and Madame Dorval again thronged the Porte-Saint-Martin to excess. Alexandre Dumas, who was present at this production has recorded how vast was his delight, how ineffable his thrills during the sombre scenes of this sepulchral melodrame. How the theatre applauded the lean livid mask of the Vampire, how it shuddered at his stealthy steps! There are, perhaps, to be found throughout the whole of the many works of Alexandre, Dumas few pages more entertaining than those chapters in his Memoires which relate with rarest humour and not a few flashes of brilliant wit his adventures at a performance of Le Vampire at the Porte-Saint-Martin in 1823. It would be difficult to find a livelier, and yet at the same time entirely serious and even critical, account of a theatrical performance. Unfortunately it is too long to give in full. In the edition of Mes Mémoires, Troisième Série, Michel Lévy, Paris, 1863, it occupies no less than five chapters, LXXIII-LXXVII, and these are none of the shortest, (pp. 136-193). One is tempted to quote some delicious passages, but the

p. 295

account might lose thereby; it must be read as a delightful whole. Yet there is one extract which May certainly be made without impertinence, the story of the Vampire which was related to Dumas by his neighbour ""le monsieur poli qui lisait un Elzévir."" They have discussed the tradition at some length, and incidentally the good bibliophile refers his young acquaintance to the work of Dom Calmet, from whom he gives ample citations. He further remarks that he has resided in Illyria for three years, and he very sharply animadverts upon certain details on Nodier's melodrama which are foreign to the vampire tradition. ""You speak of vampires as though they really existed,"" remarks Dumas. ""Of course they exist,"" said his neighbour dryly. ""Have you ever seen one then?"" ""Most certainly I have."" ""That was whilst you were in Illyria?"" ""Yes.""

""Et vous y avez vu des vampires?""

""Vous savez que c'est la, terre claissique des vampires, l'Illyrie, comme la Hongrie, la Servie, la Pologne.

""Non, je no sais pas . . . je ne sais rien. Où étaient ces vampires que vous avez vus?

""A Spalatro. Je logeais chez un bonhomme de soixante-deux ans. Il mourut. Trois jours après avoir été enterré, il apparut la nuit à son fils et lui demanda à manger; son fils le servit selon des desirs; il mangea et disparut. Le lendemain, le fils me raconta ce qui lui était arrivé, me disant que bien certainement son père ne reviendrait pas pour une fois, et m'invitant a me mettre, la nuit suivante, à une fenêtre pour le voir entrer et sortir. J'étais curieux de voir un vampire. Je me mis à la fenêtre; mais, cette nuit-la, il ne vint pas. Le fils me dit, alors, do ne pas me décourager, qu'il viendrait probablement la nuit suivante.--La nuit suivante, je me remis donc à ma fenêtre, et, en effet, vers minuit, je reconnus parfaitement le vieillard. Il venait du côté de cimetière; il marchait d'un bon pas; mais son pas ne faisait aucun bruit. Arrivé à la porte, il frappa,; je comptai trois coups; les coups résonnèrent secs sur le chêne, comme si l'on eut frappé avec un os, et non avec un doigt. Le fils, vint ouvrir la porte, et le vieillard entra. . . .

""J'écoutais ce récit avec la plus grande attention, et je commençais à prefèrer les entr'actes au mélodrame.

""Ma curiosité était trop vivement excitée, reprit men voisin,

p. 296

pour que je quittasse ma fenêtre; j'y demeurai donc. Une demi-heure après, le vieillard sortit; il retournait d'où il était venu, c'est-a-dire du côté du cimetiere. A l'angle d'une muraille, il disparut. Presque au même instant, ma porte s'ouvrit. Je me retournai vivement, c'était son fils. It était fort pâle. 'Et bien, lui dis-je, votre père est venu?--Oui . . . L'avez-vous vu entrer? Entrer et sortir. . . Qu'a-t-il fait aujourd'hui? Il m'a demandé à boire et à manger, comme l'autre jour. Et il a bu et mangé? Il a bu et mangé . . . Mais ce n'est pas le tout. . . voici ce qui m'inquiète. . . Il m'a dit . . . Ah! il vous a parlé pour autre chose que pour vous demander à, boire et a manger? . . . Oui, il m'a dit: 'Voici deux fois que je viens manger chez toi. C'est à ton tour maintenant de venir manger chez moi.' Diable! . . . Je l'attends après demain à la même heure. Diable! Diable! Eh! oui, justement, voilà ce qui me tracasse.' Le surlendemain, on le trouva mort dans son lit! Ce même jour, deux ou trois autres, personnes du même village qui avaient vu aussi le vieillard, et qui lui avaient parlé, tombèrent malades et moururent à leur tour. Il fut donc reconnu que le vieillard était vampire. On s'informa auprès de moi; je racontai ce que favais vu et entendu. La justice se transporta au cimetière. On ouvrit les tombeaux de tous ceux qui étaient morts depuis six semaines; tous ces, cadavres étaient en décomposition. Mais, quand on en vint au tombeau de Kisilova,--c'était le nom du vieillard,--on le trouva les yeux ouverts, la bouche vermeille, respirant à pleins poumons, et cependant immobile, comme mort. On lui enfonça un pieu dans le coeur; il jeta un grand cri, et rendit le sang par le bouche; puis on le mit sur un bûcher, on le réduisit en cendre, et l'on jeta la cendre au vent. . . . Quelque temps après, je quittai le pays de sorte que je ne pus savoir si son fils était devenu vampire comme lui.

""Pourquoi serait-il devenu vampire comme lui? demandai-je.

""Ah! parce que c'est l'habitude, que les personnes qui meurent du vampirisme deviennent vampires.

""En vérité, vous dites cela comme si c'était un fait avéré.

""Mais c'est qu'aussi c'est un fait avéré, connu, enregistré!""

It will readily be remembered that in Monte-Cristo when

p. 297

during the performance of Parisina at the Teatro Argentino, Rome, the Count and Haidée enter their box, the Countess G------ directing her opera-glass in that direction asks Franz d'Epinay who they may be remarking that as for herself, ""All I can say is that the gentleman whose history I am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up; be looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly gravedigger to quit his tomb for a while, and revisit this earth of ours, than anything human. How ghastly pale he is!"" ""Oh, he is always as colourless as you now see him,"" said Franz. ""Then you know him?"" almost screamed the countess. ""Oh! pray do, for Heaven's sake, tell us all about--is he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse, or what?"" A few moments later when the lady has carefully studied the loge of their mysterious vis-à-vis, Franz demands: ""Well, what do you think of our mysterious neighbour?"" ""Why, that he is no other than Lord Ruthven himself in a living frame,"" was the reply. This fresh allusion to Byron drew a smile to Franz's countenance; although he could not but allow that if anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires, it would be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him . . . . . Is it possible,"" whispered Franz, ""that you entertain any fear?"" ""I'll tell you,"" answered the countess. ""Byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires, and even assured me he had seen some. The description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the features and character of the man before us. Oh! it is the exact personification of what I have been led to expect. The coal-black hair, large bright, glittering eyes, in which a wild, unearthly fire seems burning,-the same ghastly paleness!""[40]

Nearly thirty years after Dumas in collaboration with Maquet utilized the theme of Le Vampire for his own drama of the same name which was given at the Ambigu-Comique, 20th December, 1851, and which may conveniently be considered here.

Le Vampire is described as a ""Drame Fantastique en Cinq Actes, en Dix Tableaux"" and there are very many characters in this remarkable play. The principal parts were taken as follows: Lord Ruthwen, M. Arnault; Gilbert de Tiffauges, M. Goujet; Juan Rozo, a Spanish inn-keeper, M. Coquet;

p. 298

Botaro, his son-in-law, M. Curcy; Lazare, M. Laurent; Lahennée, M. Thierry; Jarwick, M. Lavergne; the Ghoul, Mme. Lucie Mabire; Hélène de Tiffauges, Mile. Jane Essler; Juana, Mile. Marie Clarisse; Antonia, Mlle. Daroux; Petra, Rozo's daughter, Mile. Heloïse; and the mystic fairy Mélusine, Mlle. Isabelle Constant. Lazare is a capital character, but the intrusion from Oriental legend of the ghoul cannot be considered happy. On the other hand the appearance of Mélusine, whose legend was collected about the end of the fourteenth century by Jean d'Arras, is certainly effective and entirely in keeping with the history, since according to Paracelsus she was an occult power, and in folk lore she is often represented as protecting ancient houses--in Belgium she is the guardian of the old family de Gavre,--whilst one of her four sons became King of Brittany.

It is hardly necessary to do more than give the very briefest outline of the story as Dumas tells it. The play opens with a crowded scene of merrymakers in the patio of Juan Rozo's inn. They are celebrating the nuptials of his daughter with young Botaro, and every room is occupied by his friends. and acquaintance in festive mood. Juana, who is staying at the hostlery seeks for a guide to the castle of Tormenar, which lies at some little distance, for there she is to meet Don Luis de Figuerroa, whom she will wed upon the following day. She has secretly left the convent of Annunciades, where she was a boarder, since her father has other designs for her hand, and accordingly it is necessary that she should meet her betrothed in some lonely spot. But nobody, not even the good-natured Lazare, the servant of the inn, will conduct her to the haunted castle, ""un château qui est en ruine, un château qui ne loge que des reptiles, et qui n'héberge que des fantômes."" However, a numerous company, amongst whom is Gilbert de Tiffauges, arrives at the inn, and these travellers on being told that they cannot be accommodated in spite of the fact that night is falling, incontinently resolve to take up their quarters in Tormenar, so in spite of the warnings about ghosts and goblins, having once well stocked themselves with wine and food they merrily set forth, Gilbert taking charge of Juana who has confided to him her story. However, a mysterious figure, a lady, apparently of rank, who has been staying at the inn watches them as they take

p. 299

their departure and mutters to herself as she fixes her gaze upon Juana: ""Il te faut deux heures pour aller retrouver ton beau fiancé. . . . Je l'aurai joint dans trois minutes!"" She is in fact the ghoul, a female vampire, and with the speed of lightning she has gone to destroy the unfortunate Don Luis.

In the second Act we see the huge Gothic hall of the old castle. A door opens and from an inner chamber the ghoul rushes out exclaiming: ""Il était jeune! Il était beau! . . . Me voilà, redevenue jeune et belle!"" The voice of Gilbert is now heard, and with the cry, ""À l'an prochain, Gilbert."" she disappears from sight. It will be remarked that in his treatment of the vampire tradition Dumas has adopted the legend that the vampire must year by year rejuvenate his waning forces by absorbing the life of another and sucking from another's veins fresh blood, a detail which although it may recommend itself to, and legitimately be used by, the dramatist and the writer of romances is actually inexact and but rarely to be met with, and only then in folk-lore not of the first value. The travellers, no small party, spread their provisions upon the huge tables in the old hall and laughing at the stories of ghosts and apparitions are soon in convivial mood. The conversation, however, eventually turns on the supernatural and Gilbert tells of his old home in Brittany, where one room in the castle is hung with the tapestry of the Fairy Mélusine, representing this lady and all her attendants. The story goes that if any of the family sleeps in that room she will descend from the tapestry and reveal his fortune, warning him of danger should such threaten. Another companion who has sojourned in Epirus speaks of the vampires, the women who will attack men and leave them dead and sapless; the men who will attack women to drink their blood. Just as the words are uttered Lord Ruthwen enters and announces himself as a belated traveller, who, finding no room at Rozo's inn down in the village has made his way thither,-he has even taken Lazare into his service. Presently the company disperse to their several rooms to make themselves as comfortable as may be for the night in such difficult circumstances. To his horror Gilbert discovers in the chamber he is to occupy the body of a young man, strangely pale, with a slight wound in the throat. By a letter he finds near upon the body it is plain that this can be none other

p. 300

than the unfortunate Don Luis. At the same moment a piercing cry is heard, and Juana ghostly pale and dying totters from her room. Gilbert rushes to her assistance just in time to see Lord Ruthwen dart out after her as she falls dead at his feet. In a moment he has drawn his sword and strikes Ruthwen to the heart, before he recognizes who it may be. In faltering accents Ruthwen explains that hearing a cry he has gone to the assistance of the lady, and with his last breath he implores Gilbert, who is well-nigh distracted at the unhappy accident, to bear his body to the hillside, where it may be bathed in the earliest rays of the new moon. This Gilbert promises, and in the final tableau we see the body of Lord Ruthwen laid upon the mountain. The moon slowly issues from the clouds, and as its silver light falls upon the corpse it seems as though the eyes opened and the mouth smiled. A moment more and the Vampire leaps to his feet re-vitalized and with fresh energy for some new demoniac enterprise.

In Act III. we find ourselves in Brittany, about a year later, at the château de Tiffauges where Hélène awaits her brother's return. After an affectionate greeting he confides to her the secret of his love for Antonia a lady of Spalatro in Dalmatia, and she in her turn informs him that she is about to give her hand to the Baron de Marsden. This latter proves to be none other than Lord Ruthwen, who informs Gilbert that he was sore wounded indeed at Tormenar, but that certain kindly shepherds finding him on the mountain side nursed him back to life. Moreover, he explains his change of name by informing them that his elder brother having recently died, he has succeeded to the title and estates. Visiting Tiffauges in the hope of meeting Gilbert once more, he has fallen a victim to the charms of Hélène. The explanation is cleverly contrived, but at the same time Gilbert is hardly convinced; he feels that there is some mysterious and terrible secret lurking in the background. A happy idea strikes him. He will sleep that night in the tapestry chamber of the lady Mélusine. The scene that follows must have been extraordinarily effective upon the stage. Gilbert is slumbering, and from their places in the tapestry step forth Mélusine and her court to warn the scion of her house that danger is near. From the framed canvas and the panels descend with stately stride

p. 301

the old barons to tell their descendant of the horror that encompasses him, Mélusine reveals the secret.

""Prions, pour qu' à Gilbert Dieu tout-puissant inspire Un généreux effort.
Ruthwen est un démon, Ruthwen est un vampire; Son amour, c'est la mort!""

(One cannot but recall the famous scene in Gilbert and Sullivan's Ruddigore with its subtle admixture of beauty, fantasy and humour.)

In Act IV of Le Vampire we are shown the accomplishment of Ruthwen's designs against Hélène. Gilbert's frenzied warnings and denunciations are heard with alarm but with unbelief. They whisper that he is a lunatic, and when Ruthwen relates a cunning story of a mischance in Spain which temporarily unsettled Gilbert's reason, a story that seems borne out in every detail by the unhappy brother's horror and despair, the attendants for his own safety seek to restrain their young master. Ruthwen triumphs. But now the ghoul appears and bids him take heed how he seeks Gilbert's life for that is hers, and she will not likely relinquish her prey. Ruthwen defies her and the two vampires part in horrid enmity. Lazare cautions Hélène that her brother's story is no figment, but it is too late, the vampire seizes his victim and as midnight strikes, he destroys his hapless bride and quaffs his fill from her veins. Too late Gilbert succeeds in forcing an entrance. There is a terrific struggle, and Ruthwen is hurled from the window into the depths of a tremendous valley.

In the last act we find that in order to escape the pursuit of Ruthwen, who has extricated himself unhurt but filled with designs of even more malignant vengeance, Gilbert has transported Antonia to Circassia. Here, however, we meet the ghoul who, disguising herself under the name of Ziska, obtained admittance to the castle in the quality of an attendant upon Antonia. She informs Gilbert that she alone can save his betrothed from the vampire, and at that moment the ghastly face of Ruthwen is actually seen peering through the window. She demands that he shall relinquish Antonia's hand, and accept her love though it be to death. He refuses to betray Antonia, and at length by a supreme act of renunciation she divulges the secret whereby the Vampire may be annihilated, although this revelation must put an end to her own

p. 302

existence. Ziska explains how Gilbert's sword is to be blessed by a priest with a certain occult formula and if the weapon thus consecrated be driven through the Vampire's heart it will once and for all rid the world of this infernal pest. Yet as she speaks she seems to vanish in flames and they hear her last sad sigh; ""Adieu pour ce monde! Adieu pour l'autre! Adieu pour l'éternité""!

The final scene is a deserted cemetery. ""Tombes, cyprès. Fond sombre et fantastique; neige sur la terre; lune rouge au ciel."" The Vampire lies half in and half out of his grave, grinning hideously. Gilbert is standing near. ""Pour la dernière fois, adore Dieu!"" he adjures. ""Non,"" yells the monster. ""Alors, desespère et meurs""! cries Gilbert and plunges the hallowed sword into the monster's heart. The Vampire falls back into the grave, howling fearfully, and a heavy stone closing him in fast seals him there in the womb of the earth for ever and ever. ""Au nom du Seigneur, Ruthwen, je to scelle dans cette tombe pour l'éternité"", et Gilbert trace sur la pierre une croix que devient lumineuse. A great aureola fills the sky and. multitudes of rejoicing angels are seen. Among them are Hélène and Juana, smiling in happiest benison, whilst there rises from the earth the body of Ziska, radiant and beautiful, to join the glorious throng among whose immortal ranks she is enrolled by the merits of her great act of renunciation and unselfish love.

This drama of Dumas is infinitely more elaborate than the play of Nodier, but I am not altogether certain whether it is in some respects so good a work. The first two acts attain a high level; the scene in the tapestry chamber would be most picturesque upon the stage; there are several other telling situations and effective speeches, but as a whole it is too prolix, and we feel that the episode of Antonia in particular is an anti-climax. Nor, as I have remarked before, although material use is made of the character, can one consider the figure of the ghoul entirely in keeping with the rest. Had the level of the opening scenes been maintained we should possess an excellent piece of work. But without concentration and compression that was hardly possible, and here we have the secret of Nodier's success. Although he has an occasional crudity, it may be, which Dumas might not have tolerated, so swift is his action, as is essential to

p. 303

melodrama, so cleverly does he engage the interest of his audience, that we have no time to criticize a roughness here and there, but are rather intent to follow the next turn of the tale.

Immediately upon the furore created by Nodier's Le Vampire at the Porte-Saint-Martin in 1819 vampire plays of every kind from the most luridly sensational to the most farcically ridiculous pressed on to the boards. A contemporary critic cries: ""There is not a theatre in Paris without its Vampire! At the Porte-Saint-Martin we have le Vampire; at the Vaudeville le Vampire again; at the Variétés les trois Vampires ou le clair de la lune.""

Jean Larat[41] further mentions a play by Paul Féval, Le fils Vampire. The version by John Wilson Ross of The Loves of Paris, a romance, published by G. Vickers, 3, Catherine Street, Strand, 1846, is said to be ""Translated from the French of Paul Féval, author of 'The Vampire,' 'The Loves of the Palais-Royal,' 'The Receipt at Midnight,' 'Stella,' 'The Son of the Devil,' etc., etc."", but it does not appear whether ""The Vampire"" mentioned here is a play or a romance. Probably it is the latter but no such translation is known.

Le Vampire which was produced at the Vaudeville, 15 June, 1820,[42] is a comédic-vaudeville in one act by Scribe and Mélesville. The scene is laid Hungary, ""une salle d'un chateau gothique,"" and the characters are as follows: Le Comte de Valberg, feld-maréchal, M. Guillemin; Adolphe de Valberg, son néveu, M. Isambert; le Baron do Lourdorff, M. Fontenay; Saussmann, concierge du chateau, M. Hippolyte; Charles, valet du comte, M. Fichet; un Notaire, M. Justin; Hermance de Mansfred, Madame Rivière; Nancy, sa soeur, Madame Lucie; Péters, filleul de Saussmann, Madame Minette; with attendance of domestics and wedding guests. This elegant little piece opens with nuptials of Hermance de Mansfred at the castle of the Baron de Lourdorff, to whom she is betrothed. It appears that she has something trifled with the affections of Adolphe de Valberg, now supposed dead. Her sister, Nancy, acknowledges that she loved Adolphe, but kept silence owing to his courtship of Hermance. Adolphe's uncle, the Count de Valberg, who knows nothing of the two ladies, fearing his nephew is unworthily entangled has had him held in military detention at Temesvar, whence

p. 304

however he has disappeared. The intrigue of the seventeen scenes, although clearly unravelled in the play, is a little complicated, and it must suffice to relate by an accident Adolphe appears at the castle. Upon being asked his name he answers: ""Lord Ruthwen. An Englishman,"" whereupon he is immediately taken to be a Vampire and the servants are thrown into a state of panic. Eventually he is reconciled to his uncle who recognizes him as the brave young hero by whom his life was saved on a recent battlefield; Nancy's fidelity is rewarded with the hand of the man she loves, and who now realizes that Hermance's heart was never his; so that the curtain falls upon a double wedding.

Several Pretty lyrics are interwoven with the dialogue and Nancy's first song, to the air ""De sommeiller, encor ma chère from Fanchon la vielleuse, is as follows:

Oui, ces paysans respectables
Nous rapellent le bon vieux temps:
Chez eux on croit encore au diable,
Aux vampires, au revenants;
On croit à toutes les magies,
Aux amours, aux soins assidus,
Aux grands sorciers, aux grands genies . . .
Bref à tout ce qu'on ne voit plus!

Les Trois Vampires, ou le clair de, la lune[43] which was being played at the Variétés is a thoroughly amusing farce in one act by Brazier, Gabriel, and Armand. It shows the adventures of a bon bourgeois, M. Gobetout, who has so distracted his brain by reading stories of Vampires and ghosts that when one night he sees in his garden three shadowy figures he is well nigh beside himself with terror as he supposes they can be no other than three vampires infesting his house. A little later he catches sight of his two daughters and their abigail who appear actually to be eating with the mysterious strangers. ""Les vampires qui soupent avec mes filles!"" he groans in accents of despair. However it proves that the supper is very material, cold chicken and a glass of good wine, whilst the rendezvous is of an amorous nature, since the visitors are two young sparks and their valet. So the play ends with a triple marriage. One remark of the worthy M. Gobetout was, it is said, nightly greeted with a hurricane of applause. He was wont to murmur in pensive accents: ""Les vampires

p. 305

il nous viennent d'Angleterre . . . C'est encore une gentilesse de ces Messieurs . . . ils nous font de jolis cadeaux!""

Another farce, Encore un Vampire, which when produced in 1820 at Paris, met with considerable success, was published as by Emile B. L., and yet another vampire burlesque was contributed by A. Rousseau. Les Etrennes d'un Vampire at a minor theatre was billed as from a manuscript ""trouvé au cimitière de Père-Lachaise.""

More amusing is the work of Désaugiers who in August, 1820, gave Cadet Buteux, vampire, avec relation véridique du prologue et des trois actes de cet épouvantable mélodrame écrit sous la dictée de ce passeux du Gros Caillou, par son secretaire, Désaugiers. When published by Rosa, 1820, this libretto bore the motto: ""Vivent les morts!""

Yet another burlesque published by Martinet, 1820, is Le Vampire, mélodrame en trois actes, paroles de Pierre de la Fosse de la rue des Morts.[44] A few verses from this vaudeville may be interesting to quote, particularly as showing the long continued popularity of Nodier's melodrama.

Lisant pour un sou d'politique
Plac' Royale, sur un banc,
J'tombe, le tour est diabolique,
A' point nommé, sur l'Drapeau blanc.

J'prends un billet, non pas pour le parterre,
Ces places sont réservées aux amis,
Sans l'secours de l'abbé Saint-Pierre,
Avec treiz sous' j'monte au paradis.

Au dernier bane, paix, qu'chacun s'taise
A' bas la gueule on crie du premier rang,
L'rideau s'lève et quoique très mal à l'aise,
Le croirez-vous, j'vois le Père Lachaise,
Du dernier bane.

The Vampire is described as ""d'échappé de corbillard,"" One sees everywhere

Des fantôms, des revenans,
Mettant la téte a la fenêtre,
Afin d'regarder les passans.

There was even a Polichinel Vampire which when performed at the Circus Maurice in 1822 attracted all who had a mind

p. 306

for a hearty laugh, and a contemporary visitor[45] to Paris merrily wrote that ""Polichinel is the very jolliest fellow in the world.""[46]

A comic operetta in one act, Le Vampire by Martin Joseph Mengals which was produced at Ghent, 1 March, 1826, deserves no more than passing mention.

James Robinson Planché speedily adapted Nodier's Le Vampire as The Vampire, or, The Bride of the Isles, and his version with music by Joseph Binns Hart[47] was brought out at the English Opera House, 9th August, 1820, with T. P. Cooke[48] as Ruthven, Earl of Marsden, the Vampire. Owing to his fine acting in the part, and perhaps a little to the scenic effects--the scene is laid in the Caverns of Staffa--the play was given nightly to packed houses. It is interesting to remark that for this piece the celebrated vampire trap was invented. Of this I quote the following simple description: ""A vampire trap consists of two or more flaps, usually india-rubber, through which the sprite can disappear almost instantly, where he falls into a blanket fixed to the under surface of the stage. As with the star trap, this trap is secured against accidents by placing another piece or slide, fitting close beneath when not required, and removed when the prompter's bell gives the signal to make ready.""

The following account of the production of The Vampire is given by Planché in his Recollections and Reflections, Chapter III.[49] Having just spoken of an Easter piece with which he had furnished Drury Lane, Abudah, or, The Talisman of Oromanes,[50] founded upon one of the Tales of the Genii[51] and which although it had a run of nine nights Planché calls a very poor piece, ""miserably put on the stage,"" he continues to speak of a subsequent success, and tells us: ""A more fortunate melodrama of mine, ""The Vampire, or The Bride of the Isles,"" was produced at the Lyceum, or English Opera House, as it was then called, 9th August, 1820. Mr. Samuel James Arnold, the proprietor and manager, had placed in my hands, for adaptation, a French melodrama, entitled ""Le Vampire,"" the scene of which was laid, with the usual recklessness of French dramatists, in Scotland, where the superstition never existed. I vainly endeavoured to induce Mr. Arnold to let me change it to some place in the East of Europe. He had set his heart on Scotch music and dresses--

p. 307

the latter, by the way, were in stock--laughed at my scruples, assured me that the public would neither know nor care--and in those days they certainly did not--and therefore there was nothing left for me but to do my best with it. The result was most satisfactory to the management. The situations were novel and effective; the music lively and popular; the cast strong, comprising T. P. Cooke, who made a great hit in the principal character, Harley, Bartley, Pearman, Mrs. Chatterley and Miss Love. The trap now so well known as ""the Vampire trap"" was invented for this piece, and the final disappearance of the Vampire caused quite a sensation. The melodrama had a long run, was often revived, and is to this day a stock piece in the country. I had an opportunity many years afterwards, however, to treat the same subject in a manner much more satisfactory to myself, and, as it happened, in the same theatre, under the same management; but of that anon.""

The full cast of The Vampire, or, The Bride of the Isles was originally as follows: ""In the Introductory Vision""; Unda, Spirit of the Flood, Miss Love; Ariel, Spirit of the Air, Miss Worgman; The Vampire, Mr. T. P. Cooke; Lady Margaret, Mrs. Chatterly. ""In the Drama "": Ruthven, Earl of Marsden, the Vampire, Mr. T. P. Cooke; Ronald, Baron of the Isles, Mr. Bartley; Robert, an English Attendant on the Baron, Mr. Pearman; M'Swill, the Baron's Henchman, Mr. Harley; Andrew, Steward to Ruthven, Mr. Minton; Father Francis, Mr. Shaw; Lady Margaret, Daughter of Ronald, Mrs. Chatterly; Effie, Daughter of Andrew, Miss Carew; Bridget Lord Ronald's Housekeeper, Mrs. Grove. With regard to the costumes of which Planché speaks it is interesting to remark that the principal characters Ruthven and Lady Margaret are described as follows: Ruthven, Silver breast plate, studded with steel buttons; plaid kilt; philibeg; flesh arms and leggings; sandals; Scotch hat and feathers; sword and dagger. Lady Margaret, white satin dress, trimmed with plaid and silver; plaid silk sash; Scotch hat and feather. This is in the true transpontine tradition of Ossianic attire. The play is timed to take one hour and thirty minutes in representation-and Planché has done his work of adaptation very well, although I doubt whether his few slight departures from the original are improvements. Nevertheless he has

p. 308

given the dialogue a native turn and an ease which were at this period too often lacking in similar versions from the French.

In 1825, T. P. Cooke visited Paris and appeared as Le Monstre at the Porte-Saint-Martin in Planché's melodrama which proved a remarkable success, running for no less than eighty nights.

The Vampire or The Bride of the Isles has its place among the repertory of Hodgson's ""Juvenile Drama,"" and this in itself is an indication of no small popularity.

In The Second Maiden's Tragedy,[52] a Globe play of 1611, licensed for the stage by Sir George Buc on 31st October of that year, a macabre drama now generally attributed to Tourneur,[53] there are some remarkable scenes which culminate in something very like necrophilia, and a perverse ill-omened melancholy pervades the whole action. In Act IV the Tyrant, a usurper, ordering soldiers to attend him with ""Lanthornes and a pickax"" makes his way at midnight to the Cathedral, crying:

Death nor the marble prison my love sleeps in
Shall keep her body lockt up from mine arms.
I must not be so cozened.

A little later: ""Enter the Tirant agen at a farder dore, which opened, bringes hym to the Toombe wher the Lady lies buried; The Toombe here discouered ritchly set forthe."" He adjures the sepulchre:

The house of silence and the Calms of rest
After tempestuous life, I claim of thee
A mistress one of the most beauteous sleepers
That ever lay so cold.

The vault is forced, whilst the lover soliloquizes:

O the moon rises; what reflection
Is thrown about the sanctified building,
E'en in a twinkling, how the monuments glisten
As if Death's palaces were all massy silver
And scorned the name of marble. Art thou cold?
I have no faith in't, yet I believe none.
Madam; 'tis I, sweet lady, pry'thee speak
'Tis thy love calls on thee; thy king, thy servant.
No! not a word, all prisoners to pale silence
I'll prove a kiss.

p. 309

First Soldier:

Here's chill venery!
'Twould make a pandar's heels ache. I'll be sworn
All my teeth chatter in my head to see't.

Tyrant:

By th' mass, thou'rt cold indeed. Beshrew thee for't,
Unkind to thine own blood? Hard hearted lady,
What injury hast thou offered to the youth
And pleasure of thy days: refuse the Court
And steal to this hard lodging, was that wisdom
.      .      .      .      Since thy life has left me
I'll clasp the body for the spirit that dwelt in't,
And love the house still for the mistress' sake.
Thou art mine now spite of destruction
And Govianus; and I will possess thee.
I once read of a Herod whose affection.
Pursued a virgin's love as I did thine,
Who for the hate she owed him killed herself
(As thou too rashly didst), without all pity;
Yet he preserved her body dead in honey,
And kept her long after her funeral:
But I'll unlock the treasure house of art
With keys of gold and bestow all on thee
Here slaves receive her humbly from our arms,
.      .      .      .      So reverently
Bear her before us gently to our palace.
Place you the stone again where we first found it.

After a while the scene is in the palace: ""They bringe the Body in a Chaire drest up in black veluet which setts out the pailenes of the handes and face, And a faire Chayne of pearle crosse her brest and the Crucyfex aboue it; He standes silent awhile letting the Musique play, beeknyng the soldiers that bringe her in to make obeisaunce to her, and he hym self makes a lowe honour to the body and kisses the hande. A song within in Voyces.

Song:

O what is Beauty that's so much adored
A flattring glass that cozens her beholders.
The Night of Death makes it look pale and horrid
The Daynty preseru'd flesh how soone it molders
To loue it lyuinge it bewitchett manye
But after life is seldom heard of any.""

Tyrant:

How pleasing art thou to us even in death
I love thee yet, above all women living
And shall do seven years hence. p. 310
I can see nothing to be mended in thee
But the too constant paleness of thy cheek.
I'd give the kingdom, but to purchase there
The breadth of a red Rose, in natural colour,
And think it the best bargain that ever king made yet,
But Fate's my hinderer,
And I must only rest content with Art,
And that I'll have in spite on't.

Accordingly an artist in painting and perfumery is summoned to adorn the face of the corpse and give it a fresh lively red colour. However this merchant of cosmetics is none other than Govianus, the rightful heir, disguised, and he fucuses the dead cheeks and lips with a peter which is confected with a strong poison, so that when the Tyrant lustfully kisses the cold flesh, he is blasted with the venom and falls in the agonies of death. The incident is extremely powerful, if extremely horrible. As the Tyrant expires Govianus taunts him thus

O thou sacrilegious villain,
Thou thief of rest, robber of monuments,
Cannot the body after funeral
Sleep in the grave for thee? Must it be raised?
Only to please the wickedness of thine eye?
Does all things end with death and not thy lust?
Hast thou devised a new way to damnation,
More dreadful than the soul of any sin
Did ever pass yet between earth and hell?

A very large number of plays are founded upon what may be termed the ""Romeo and Juliet"" motive, the awakening, or the restoration to life in some sort, of a loved one supposed dead, arousing from a trance, it may be, or a coma, a theme admitting almost innumerable variants. In the Italian, French and German theatres alone--nor does this rough list pretend to be exhaustive--we have Sforza d' Oddi's Imorti vivi (1576); Pagnini's Imorti vivi (1600); Rota's La morta viva (1674); Douville's Les morts vivans (1654); Quinault's Le fantôme amoureux (1659); Boursault's Le Mort vivant (1662); Sedaine's Der Tote ein Freyer (1778); Kurländer's Der tote Neffe; Friedrich Rambach's Der Scheintote; Leopold Huber's Der Scheintote; Theodore Friedrich's Die Scheintoten; F. L. W. Meyer's Der Verstorbene; G. Lebrun's Die Verstorbenen; Tenelli's Der Verstorbene; Holbein's ""romantisches Gemälde"" Der Verstorbene; Paers' opera Die lebenden Toten; and a ballet

It may be convenient here briefly to review the progress of the Vampire in the theatre, at least in his most important appearances.

An Italian opera, I vampiri, the work of the much applauded Neapolitian composer Silvestro di Palma, which was performed at the Teatro San Carlo[54] in 1800 did not of course take anything from the novel by Polidori which indeed, it preceded by nearly twenty years. but was rather inspired by the famous treatise of Guiseppe Davanzati: Dissertazione sopra i Vampiri di Gioseppe Davanzati Patrizio Fiorentino e Tranese, Cavaliere Gerosolimitano, Arcivescovo di Trani, e Patriarca d'Alessandria. (Seconda edizione.) Nalopi. M.D.CC.LXXXIX. Presso Filippo Raimondi. Con licenzi de' Superiori.

On 28th March, 1828,[65] at Leipzig, was produced an opera, ""Grosse romantische Oper,"" Der Vampyr, founded on the original French melodrama, the scene being changed from Scotland to Hungary. The libretto is by Wilhelm August Wohlbrück and the music by his yet more famous brother-in-law Heinrich August Marschner. Der Vampyr was an enormous success. A free adaptation of this being made by J. R. Planché, and produced at the Lyceum, 25th August, 1829, it ran for sixty nights. In his Recollections and Reflections which have before been quoted, Planché commences Chapter X by some account of this. ""In the summer of 1829 I had the opportunity of treating the subject of 'The Vampire' in accordance with my own ideas of propriety. The French melodrama had been converted into an opera for the German stage, and the music composed by Marschner.

""Mr. Hawes, who had obtained a score of it, having induced Mr. Arnold to produce it at the Lyceum, I was engaged to write the libretto, and consequently laid the scene of action in Hungary, where the superstition exists to this day, substituted for a Scotch chieftain a Wallachian Boyard, and in many other respects improved upon my earlier version. The opera was extremely well sung, and the costumes novel as well as correct, thanks to the kindness of Dr. Walsh, the traveller,[66] who gave me some valuable information respecting the national dresses of the Magyars and the Wallachians.

p. 312

""I am surprised that Marschner's most dramatic and melodious works, 'Der Vampyr,' 'Die Judin,' &c., have not been introduced to our more advanced musical audiences at one or other of our great operatic establishments.

""The production of 'Der Vampyr' was followed by that of 'The Brigand' at Drury Lane.""

Polidori's tale formed the basis of a romantic opera in three acts, the libretto of which was from the pen of C. M. Heigel, and the music by p. von Lindpaintner. This was seen at Stuttgart on 2 Ist September, 1828, and it proved a remarkable success. It was announced as being from ""Byron's famous tale,"" although at this date such an attribution can hardly have deceived any.

On 25th May, 1857, there was produced in Berlin a ""Komischen Zauber-Ballet Morgano"" by Paul Taglioni with music by J. Hertzel. The scene is laid in Hungary during the seventeenth century, and in the sixth tableau Elsa dances an infernal lavolta with the vampires in their haunted castle, but she is rescued by her lover, Retzka, who slays the vampire Morgano with a consecrated poniard. In 1861 at Milan appeared a ballet by Rotta, Il vampiro, with music by Paolo Giorza. Guten Abend Herr Fischer! oder, Der Vampyr is a light vaudeville in one act by G. Belly and G. Löffler, with music by W. Telle, which had some success in its day. Ein Vampyr by Ulrich Franks (Ulla Wolf) given at Vienna in 1877 is a farce taken from Scribe.

In England Dion Boucicault's[57] The Vampire, in three acts was produced at the Princess's Theatre, London, 19th June, 1852, when the author made his first appearance before a metropolitan audience. Of this drama the following criticism, if criticism it may be called, was given by Henry Morley in his ""Journal of a London Playgoer."" It must be remembered that Morley continually shows himself extremely prejudiced and his censure must not be taken any more seriously than we regard the ill-word of many critics to-day, for example, the shrill petulant piping and the childish miffs of St. John Ervine in the sullens. Under 19th June Morley writes: ""If there be any truth in the old adage, that 'when things are at the worst they must mend,' the bettering of Spectral Melodrama is not distant; for it has reached the extreme point of inanity in the new piece which was produced on

p. 313

Monday at the Princess's Theatre, under the attractive title of The Vampire.

""Its plot is chiefly copied from a piece which some years ago turned the Lyceum into a Chamber of Horrors; but it has been spun out into three parts, facetiously described as 'Three Dramas': the little period of a century has been interposed between each part; and, in order that the outrage on the possible shall be complete, the third part is projected forward into the year that will be 1860! By this ingenious arrangement, the resuscitation of the original Vampire has been enabled to supply the lovers of the revolting at the Princess's with three acts of murder--that is, two consumated, and one attempted; but, as the delicate process of vampirical killing is exactly after the same pattern in each case, the horror is quite worn out before the career of the creature terminates. Nothing but tedious trash remains.

""To 'an honest ghost' one has no objection; but an animated corpse which goes about in Christian attire, and although never known to eat, or drink, or shake hands, is allowed to sit at good men's feasts; which renews its odious life every hundred years by sucking a young lady's blood, after fascinating her by motions which resemble mesmerism burlesqued; and which, notwithstanding its well-purchased longevity, is capable of being killed during its term in order that it may be revived by moonbeams--such a ghost as this passes all bounds of toleration.

""The monster of absurdity was personated by its reviver Mr. Boucicault, with due paleness of visage, stealthiness of pace, and solemnity of tone; the scenery, especially a moonlit ridge amidst the heights of Snowdon, was beautiful, and the costumes were prettily diversified; but the dreary repetition of fantastical horror almost exhausted even the patience which a benefit enjoins. Unfortunately, the mischief of such a piece, produced at a respectable theatre, does not end with the weariness of the spectators, who come to shudder and remain to yawn; for it is not only 'beside the purpose of playing,' but directly contravenes it; and though it may be too dull to pervert the tastes of those who witness its vapid extravagances, it has power to bring discredit on the most genial of arts.""

It may be pointed out that this account, probably through ignorance, possibly of intent, is deliberately inaccurate. p. 314 Although confessedly a poorer play than Planché's The Vampire Dion Boucicault's drama is not derived from the earlier piece, but both are taken from the same source, Polidori's romance. Seeing that Henry Morley was Emeritus Professor of English Literature in University College, London, it were reasonable to suppose that he should have been acquainted with Polidori's novella. Or perhaps I rather ought to say that therefor it was not to be expected he should have known of this famous work.

Boucicault afterwards revived The Vampire as The Phantom, and this was given in London with good applause. The American cast of the characters of The Phantom, ""As Produced at Wallack's Theatre, New York City,"" is as follows: In Act I (1645), The Phantom, Dion Boucicault; Lord Albert Clavering, Mr. J. B. Howe; Sir Hugh Neville of Graystock, Mr. Ralton; Sir Guy Musgrave, Mr. Etynge; Ralph Gwynne, Mr. Levere; Davy, Mr. T. B. Johnstone; Lucy Peveryl, Miss Agnes Robertson; Ellen, Miss Alleyne; Maud, Miss Ada Clare; Janet, Mrs. H. P. Grattan. In Act II (1750), Alan Raby, Dion Boucicault; Colonel Raby, Mr. Ralton; Edgar, his nephew, Mr. J. B. Howe; Dr. Rees, Mr. Burnett; Curate, Mr. Paul; Corporal Stump, Mr. Peters; Ada Raby, Miss Agnes Robertson; Jenny, Mrs. L. H. Allen.

Subsequently, I presume when The Phantom was given in London, some modifications were made which seem to me most decidedly to be improvements. The first act was placed in the latter part of the reign of Charles II, and two hundred years were supposed to elapse between the first and the second acts. This necessitated trifling changes in the dialogue at certain points; and naturally a complete alteration of costume to a modern style for Act II. In fact the script of the play which is printed in Dicks' Standard Plays, No. 697, (c. 1887) under ""Costume"" gives the following direction"": ""The costumes in the First Act are of the period of the latter part of the reign of Charles the Second. In the Second Art the respective characters are dressed in the provincial costume of Wales at the middle of the present century, The following description of Alan Raby's costume for each act will show the necessity of a complete change in the style of dress which this drama requires.

Alan Raby.--First Act: A Puritan's suit of black serge, bound with black velvet---cloak and breeches to match-black

p. 315

belt and buckle-black gauntlets---shirt collar thrown back so as to show the throat bare-black stockings-black velvet shoes with strap across the instep--black sugar-loaf hat and broad riband and steel buckle--phosphoric livid countenance--slightly bald head--long black lank hair combed behind the ears--bushy black eyebrows and heavy black moustache. 2nd dress: Black dress coat and overcoat of the same colour--black trousers--black waistcoat--black kid gloves, white wristbands over them--white cravat and black German hat--all modern, and such as would be worn by a gentleman at the present time."" In the theatre such a contrast would have proved very effective.

I notice that Boucicault has in certain scenes borrowed his situations pretty freely from Le Vampire of Dumas, and occasionally he has even conveyed actual dialogue from the French play.

At the commencement of The Phantom we are shown a room in a Welsh inn, and it appears that Davy and Janet the hostess have just been married. A sudden storm sends Lucy Peveryl thither for shelter, and she confides to Janet that she is on her way to meet at sundown her cousin Roland Peveryl, who is a fugitive and proscribed. On this account he dare not openly seek her hand, but the lovers are secretly betrothed. He has promised to meet her, in order to bid her farewell for a time, in the most unfrequented spot, the ruins of Raby Castle. No sooner does Janet hear that name than she cries out with horror, and speaks of a fearful story connected with the place. They are interrupted by the arrival of Lord Clavering with a party of guests, amongst whom are friends of Lucy. She frankly informs them of her rendezvous, and they decide to accompany her, more especially as the inn has not sufficient accommodation for the travellers, who resolve to take provisions and wine and spend the night in the deserted chambers of the old castle. Davy endeavours to prevent them, nor are his efforts altogether selfish. He tells them: ""No one ever sought a night's shelter in the ruins of Raby Castle, that ever lived to see the morning. . . . Within the ruins of Raby dwells some terrible thing--man or fiend! . . . No traveller that knows the road will ever venture near that spot after nightfall; but strange wayfarers, benighted in the storm have wandered to this place of shelter, and the next morning they are found--dead--each with a wound in his throat in the right side, from which they

p. 316

have evidently bled to death;--but no blood is spilt around, the face is white and fixed, as if it had died of horror."" ""And he, my betrothed,"" cries Lucy, ""Roland is there."" Nevertheless the company laugh at these old stories and determine to make their way to the old castle. This they actually find in far better state than they have been led to expect, and their servants who have insisted upon Davy showing them the way soon get a very fair supper from the provisions they have purchased at his inn. Roland Peveryl is not to be found, but whilst they are eating a stranger enters, a Puritan, and announces himself as Gervase Rookwood, a traveller who has lost his way in the mountains. Davy, however, almost collapses with terror. He recollects that many years before the castle belonged to Sir Owen Raby, a noble cavalier, while Alan Raby, his younger brother had joined the forces of Cromwell. Taking advantage of this difference the traitor one midnight with a band of Puritan soldiers surprises the castle, and butchers the sleeping garrison, killing his brother with his own hand. About a year later, however, the tables are turned, the Royalists recapture the place, Alan Raby is seized, and in their rage they hurl the fratricide from a window which hung shudderingly over a fearful precipice. Curiously enough no trace of the body could ever be recovered. But Davy recognizes that Gervase Rookwood is none other than Alan Raby. Here we have the old belief that a man guilty of some, monstrous crime, in this case rebellion against the King and the murder of a brother, is compelled to return as a vampire. When the company disperse to their various apartments for the night Lord Clavering is horrified to discover in his room the dead body of young Roland Peveryl, ""a wound deep in his throat, but bloodless."" At the same moment a piercing scream is heard and Lucy Peveryl rushing from her chamber with her hands wildly clasping her neck falls dead in Lord Clavering's arms. Seeing as he thinks a shadowy form that steals from her room he draws a pistol and fires. When the company hurry in with lights they discover Alan Raby has been shot. In faltering accents the dying man explains that hearing a cry for help he hastened to the lady's assistance. He will only forgive Lord Clavering on one condition. ""When I have breathed my last, let my body be conveyed amongst the peaks of Snowdon, and there exposed to the first rays of the rising

p. 317

moon which touch the earth."" This is done, and the first act concludes with a tableau of the peaks of Snowdon, whilst from behind the clouds there sails high in the heaven a silver sickle that strikes the corpse with her argent shaft of mystic light. The vampire wakes, and leaps to his feet crying in exultant tones: ""Fountain of my life: once more thy rays restore me. Death! I defy thee!""

It cannot escape notice that in this act there are many parallels with Le Vampire of Dumas. Raby Castle is the Castle of Tormenar; Lucy Peveryl is Juana; Roland Peveryl, Don Luis de Figuerroa; Lord Clavering, Gilbert de Tiffauges; and Davy the gracioso Lazare.

Two centuries have flown. Raby Castle is now inhabited in possession of Colonel Raby, whose daughter is betrothed to her cousin Edgar. It has been falsely reported that this latter fell in battle, but the scene opens with his return. When the sad news first arrived Ada Raby was stricken almost to death, and, as they believed, actually died; but she was recalled to life by a mysterious stranger, since which hour she seems to, have fallen completely under his influence and in some extraordinary way only to respond to his power. This is none other than Gervase Rookwood, who now appears and informs Colonel Raby that he and none other is the lawful lord of Raby Castle. The Colonel's claim lies in the fact that when years before the last of the old Raby family, Sir Alan Raby died, or rather was killed, and no will could be found, the estate reverted to a distant branch of the Rabys, now represented by the Colonel. However, a document is produced in the handwriting of Alan Raby, his will, wherein he bequeaths the estate to Gervase Rookwood and the Rookwood successors. It seemed as though such a title cannot be resisted, but Doctor Rees, a scholar of occultism, is filled with the gravest suspicions of the stranger. In a ""Dictionary of Necromancy, a rare work by Dr. Dee,"" he has read of vampires, and he divines the demoniac nature of the pretended Rookwood. In a trancelike state Ada Raby has rejected Edgar and is to be given to the stranger, when Dr. Rees examining the documents discovers that the will of Sir Alan Raby, which must be some two hundred years old, although the hand is doubtless that of Raby as the archives prove, is written upon paper which has a watermark of 1850, ""scarcely five years old."" The vampire who

p. 318

endeavours to assassinate Edgar, is killed by a charmed bullet. Whilst his limbs relax in death the hypnotic spell vanishes from Ada's mind and she is united to her lover. But to their horror they notice that as the moonlight touches the body of Alan Raby where he has fallen, his members begin to twitch anew with life. Dr. Rees seizes the vampire and hurls the body into the darkest chasm of the mountain side, where no beam nor ray can ever penetrate or find the smallest chink of entrance.

The Phantom is, of course, somewhat old-fashioned and a little stilted, as was the mode, in its diction. No doubt some of the situations could be revised and far more neatly turned, yet on the whole I conceive that it should prove of its kind excellent fare in the theatre, and some scenes, at least, in capable hands were not without emotional appeal, I had almost said a certain impressiveness. Far worse dramas have (not undeservedly) earned their meed of approbation and applause.

On 15th August, 1872, was advertised: ""Royal Strand Theatre. Production of a Bit of Moonshine in Three Rays, entitled 'The Vampire,' written by R. Reece."" There was indeed a bounteous bill of fare. At seven was given a farce, The Married Bachelor; at 7.30 Byron's Not Such a Fool as He Looks; ""At Half Past Nine the new and original Burlesque, a little Bit of Moonshine in Three Rays, called The Vampire, written by R. Reece. The new Music by John Fitzgerald, the New Scenery Painted by H. P. Hall; Dresses by May, Mrs. Richardson and Assistants; Machinery by Wood; Properties by Ball. The Piece produced under the direction of Mrs. Swanborough, Mr. J. Wallace, and Mr. Reece."" The house, says the Era, 18th August, 1872, was crowded for this ""satirical burlesque."" His play, the author wrote, was founded upon ""a German legend, Lord Byron's story, and a Boucicaultian drama."" The Vampire, according to Reece, is a plagiarist who lives on other people's brains. The title rôle was acted by Edward Terry who kept the audience in roars of laughter. ""Mr. Terry's make-up as the Vampire was something extraordinary, and he worked with unflagging energy to add 'go' to the novelty."" During a picnic in the ruins of Raby Castle the Vampire endeavours to steal the note books of Ada Raby (Miss Emily Pitt) and Lady Audley Moonstone (Mrs. Raymond) two lady novelists, so that he may utilize their efforts for his weekly instalment of the ""penny dreadful"" and other fiction.

p. 319

He is attacked by the two lovers of the ladies, Lord Albert Clavering (Miss Bella Goodall) and Edgar (Miss Topsy Venn), and a good deal of broadest farce follows. ""The author was cordially greeted upon his appearance before the curtain, and the latest Strand burlesque may be noted as an undoubted success."" The Illustrated London News, 24th August, 1872, although very justly doubting the propriety of the subject as a theme for travesty highly praised Edward. Terry ""as the Hibernian plagiarist with the broadest of brogues and the most ghastly of faces."" As Allan Raby he haunts the ruins of Raby Castle, Raby Hall, and the Peak of Snowdon, seeking to filch the notebooks of tourists, ""from which he may gather materials for a three-volume novel which he has been engaged by a publisher to compose.""

On Monday, 27th September, 1909, at the Paragon Theatre was produced The Vampire, a ""two-scene sketch,"" adapted by Mr. José G. Levy from the French of Mme. C. le Vylars and Pierre Souvestre. ""It is a capitally written little piece conceived. in the grand Guignol vein;"" The Stage, 30th September, 1909. The first scene is Harry le Strang's smoking-room. Harry has been infatuated with a demi-mondaine named Sonia, who shot herself in a fit of remorse. The despairing lover is in communication with a Hindoo spiritualist Seratsih, who has evoked the spirit of the dead woman, now become a vampire and preying upon Harry's vitality and reason. An old friend, Jack Harlinger, in order as he thinks to save the situation persuades his own fiancée, Olga Kay, to personate the ghost of Sonia. The result is swift tragedy, for the maddened Harry le Strang shoots her dead destroying the vampire, whilst he himself falls at the revolver of Jack Harlingen Harry le Strang was played by Charles Hanbury; Jack Harlinger, Lauderdale Maitland; Seratsih, Clinton Barrett; and Olga Kay, Janet Alexander. The piece was very well received.

The Vampire, a Tragedy in Five Acts, by St. John Dorset (the Rev. Hugo John Belfour), Second Edition, 1821,[60] does not appear to have been acted. It was dedicated to W. G. Macready, Esq., whose kindness the author acknowledges in most grateful terms. The story is Oriental, the same being laid in Alexandria, and it is a ""moral"" vampire that is shown by the poet. In his ""advertisement"" he quotes a passage

p. 320

from the Examiner, when noticing Planché's melodrama wrote: ""There are Vampires who waste the heart and happiness of those they are connected with, Vampires of avarice, Vampires of spleen, Vampires of debauchery, Vampires in all the shapes of selfishness and domestic tyranny."" This is his theme, and although his pages have considerable merit I do not conceive that his scenes would have been entirely successful on the stage, since they are poetical and reflective rather than dramatic,

In Germany sensational fiction was long largely influenced by Polidori, and we have such romances as Zschokke's Der tote Gast, Spindler's Der Vampyr und seine Braut, Theodor Hildebrand's Der Vampyr, oder die Totenbraut. Edwin Bauer's roman à clef the clever Der Baron Vampyr,"" which was published at Leipzig in 1846, hardly concerns as here, whilst Ewald August König's sensational Ein moderner Vampyr,[62] which appeared in 1883, or Franz Hirsch's Moderne Vampyr,[63] 1873, productions which only use in their titles the word ""Vampire"" to attract,--one might say, to ensnare attention, are in this connexion no more deserving of consideration than mere chap-books and pedlar's penny-ware such as Morelli's Der Vampyr, and Dr. Seltzam's pornographic Die Vampyre der Residenz.

Undoubtedly the vampire tradition has never been treated with such consummate skill as by Théophile Gautier in his exquisite prose poem La Morte Amoureuse, which first appeared in the Chronique de Paris on 23rd and 26th June, 1836, when the young author was not quite twenty-five. Although the theme is not original yet perhaps nowhere beside has it been so ingeniously moulded with such delicacy of style, with such rich and vivid colouring, with such emotion and such repression. The darker shadows of the tradition are suggested rather than portrayed, yet none can deny that there is an atmosphere of sombre mystery, even a touch of morbid horror which with complete artistry the writer allows us to suspect rather than to comprehend. The very vagueness of the relation adds to the illusion. We hardly know whether Romuald is the young country priest occupied in prayer and good works, or whether he is the Renaissance seignior living a life of passion and hot extravagance. As he himself cries: ""Sometimes I thought I was a priest who dreamed every night that be was a nobleman, sometimes that I was a nobleman who dreamed that he was a

p. 321

priest. I could no longer distinguish dreams from real life; I did not know where reality began and illusion ended. The dissolute, supercilious young lord jeered at the priest, and the priest abhorred the dissipations of the young lord."" But were he humble priest, or were he profligate patrician, one emotion remained eternally the same, his love for Clarimonde. At length the Abbé Serapion dissolves the glamour. Sternly he bids young Romuald accompany him to the deserted cemetery where Clarimonde lies buried; he exhumes the body, and as he sprinkles it with holy water it crumbles into dust. Then also has the lord Romuald gone for ever. There only remains the poor priest of God broken and alone, who grows old in an obscure parish in the depths of a wood, and who well-nigh half a century after scarcely dares to stir the ashes of that memory.

There are in English not a few stories which deal with the vampire tradition, and many of these are well imagined and cleverly contrived; the morbid horror of the thing has often been conveyed with considerable power, but yet it will, I think, be universally allowed that no author has written pages comparable to this story of Gautier. It is hardly to be disputed that the best of the English vampire stories is Sheridan Le Fanu's Carmilla, which the authorities upon the bibliography of this author[64] have not traced further back than its appearance in the collection entitled In A Glass Darkly, 1872,[65] Carmilla which is a story of some length, containing sixteen chapters, is exceedingly well told and it certainly exhibits that note of haunting dread which is peculiar to Le Fanu's work. The castle in Styria and the family who inhabit it are excellently done, nor will the arrival of Carmilla and the mysterious coach wherein sat ""a hideous black woman, with a sort of coloured turban on her head, who was gazing all the time from the carriage window, nodding and grinning derisively towards the ladies, with gleaming eyes and large white eyeballs, and her teeth set as if in fury,"" easily be forgotten.

It must suffice to mention very briefly but a few short stories in English where the vampire element is present. E. F. Benson has evoked real horror in his The Boom in the Tower and the horrible creature tangled in her rotting shroud all foul with mould and damp who returns from her accursed grave is loathly to the last degree.

p. 322

The Flowering of the Strange Orchid, by H. G. Wells, introduces a botanical vampire. An orchid collector is found dead in a jungle in the Andaman Islands, with a strange bulb lying near him. This is brought to England and carefully tended by a botanist until it comes to flower. But when at last the blossoms burst open great tendrils suddenly reach out to grasp the man sucking his blood with hideous gusts. The unfortunate wretch has to be violently torn away from the plant which drips with blood scare e in time to save his life.

This idea closely resembles Fred M. White's story, The Purple Terror, which appeared in the Strand Magazine, September, 1899, Vol. xviii, No. 105. Here Lieutenant Will Scarlett, an American officer and a number of his men have to make their way across a certain tract of Cuban Territory. Spending the night in a country posada they are attracted by a pretty dancing girl who is wearing twined round her shoulders a garland of purple orchids larger than any known variety. The blossoms which a blood-red centre exhale a strange exotic perfume. Scarlett is fired with the enthusiasm of giving a new orchid to the horticultural world, and on the following morning a native, named Tito, undertakes to guide him to the spot. He learns that the natives call them ""the devil's poppies"" and that the flowers grow in the high trees where their blossoms cling to long green tendrils. As night falls the little company arrives at a plateau ringed by tall trees whose branches are crowned with great wreaths of the purple flower nestling amid coils of long green ropery. To their alarm they note that the ground is covered with bleaching bones, the skeletons of men, animals, and birds alike. Yet perforce they must camp there rather than risk the miasma of the lower valley. Scarlett keeps watch. In the darkness there is a rustling sound and suddenly a long green tendril furnished at the end with a sucker armed with sharp spines like teeth descends and snatches one of the men from the ground. As it is about to withdraw Scarlett with inconceivable swiftness slashes it through with his knife. But the man's clothing has even in that moment been cut through by the razor spines and his body is marked by a number of punctures where his blood is oozing in great drops. Immediately half-a-dozen and more lithe living cords with fanged mouths fall groping for their prey. The men are hurriedly awakened and with

p. 323

difficulty they extricate themselves by sending their whingers, ripping and tearing in every direction. It appears that the vampire poppies at night send down these tendrils to gather moisture. Anything which the fearful suckers can catch they drain dry, be it man or beast or bird. Lieutenant Scarlett and his men have been deliberately led into this trap by Tito, who is madly jealous of their compliments to Zara, the dancing-girl. They hold him prisoner and threaten him with condign punishment at headquarters.

Algernon Blackwood brings together two types of vampires in his story The Transfer. One is a human being, the psychic sponge, who absorbs and seems to live upon the vitality of others. He is thus described by the governess: ""I watched his hard, bleak face; I noticed how thin he was, and the curious oily brightness of his steady eyes. And everything he said or did announced what I may dare to call the suction of his presence."" There is also a yet more horrible monster, if one may term it so, the Forbidden Corner, an arid barren spot in the midst of the rose garden, naked and bald amid luxuriant growth. A child who knows its evil secret says: ""It's bad. It's hungry. It's dying because it can't get the food it wants. But I know what would make it feel right."" When the human vampire ventures near this spot it exerts its secret strength and draws him to itself. He falls into the middle of the patch and it drinks his energy. He lives on, but he seems to be nothing more than a physical husk or shell without vitality. As for the Forbidden Corner ""it lay untouched, full of great, luscious, driving weeds and creepers, very strong, full fed and bursting thick with life.""

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in his little story, The Parasite, has depicted a human vampire or psychic sponge in the person of Miss Penelosa, who is described as being a small frail creature, ""with a pale peaky face, an insignificant presence and retiring manner."" Nevertheless she is able to obsess Professor Gilroy who says: ""She has a parasite soul, yes, she is a parasite; a monster parasite. She creeps into my form as the hermit crab creeps into the whelk's shell."" To his horror he realizes that under her influence his will becomes weaker and weaker and he is bound to seek her presence. He resists for a while, but the force becomes so overmastering that he is compelled to yield, loathing himself as he does so. When he visits her,

p. 324

with a terrific effort he breaks the spell and denounces her unhallowed fascination in burning words. However, his victory is short indeed. She persecutes him most bitterly, and when he unburdens his troubles to his college professor the only result is a prescription of chloral and bromide, which promptly goes into the gutter. With devilish craft the vampire destroys his reputation as a scholar, and brings about ill-natured gossip and comment. She is able to confuse his brain during his lectures, so that he talks unintelligible nonsense and his classes become the laughing-stock of the university, until at length the authorities are obliged to suspend him from his position. Almost in despair he cries: ""And the most dreadful part of it all is my loneliness. Here I sit in a commonplace English bow-window looking out upon a common-place English street, with its garish buses and its lounging policemen, and behind me there hangs a shadow which is out of all keeping with the age and place. In the home of knowledge I am weighed down and tortured by a power of which science knows nothing. No magistrate would listen to me. No paper would discuss my case. No doctor would believe my symptoms. My own most intimate friends would only look upon it as a sign of brain derangement. I am out of all touch with my kind.""

The unfortunate victim is driven even deeper still by this unhallowed influence, which causes him to rob a bank, violently assault a friend, and finally to come within an ace of mutilating the features of his betrothed. At length the persecution ceases with the sudden death of the vampire, Miss Penelosa.

The True Story of a Vampire is a pathetic little story, very exquisitely told, in Studies of Death, by Stanislaus Eric, Count Stenbock, who wrote some verses of extraordinary charm in Love, Sleep, and Dreams; Myrtle, Rue, and Cypress; The Shadow of Death; and who at least once in The Other Side told a macabre legend with most powerful and haunting effect. A mysterious Count Vardaleh visits the remote styrian castle of old Baron Wronski, and before long attains an occult influence over the boy heir, Gabriel. The lad wastes away, and Count Vardaleh is heard to murmur: ""My darling, I fain would spare thee; but thy life is my life, and I must live, I who would rather die. Will God not have any mercy on me? Oh, oh! life; oh, the torture of life! . . . O Gabriel, my beloved! My life, yes, life--oh, my life? I am sure this is

p. 325

but a little I demand of thee. Surely the superabundance of life can spare a little to one who is already dead."" As the boy lies wan and ill, the Count enters the room and presses a long feverish kiss upon his lips. Vardaleh rushes forth, and can never be traced again. Gabriel has expired in the agony of that embrace.

In a novel, The Vampire, by Reginald Hodder, a woman who is the leader of an occult society is forced to exercise her powers as a vampire to prevent the ebbing of her vitality. Here her ravages are psychic rather than physical, albeit in fact the two so closely commingled that they are not to be separated. A curious feature in the tale is that this woman is represented as putting forth her energies through the medium of a metallic talisman, and various struggles to gain possession of the object form the theme of the story. It falls into the hands of persons who would employ it for evil purposes, when it constitutes a very formidable menace, but at the last after a number of extraordinary happenings it is happily recovered.

The traditional, but yet more horrible vampire is presented to us by F. Marion Crawford in For the Blood Is the Life. Here a young man, who has been loved by a girl whose affection he was unable to return, is after her death vampirised by her, and when his friends suspect the truth they determine to rescue him. They find him upon her grave, a thin stream of blood trickling from his throat. ""And the flickering light of the lantern played upon another face that looked up from the feast,--upon two deep, dead eyes that saw in spite of death--upon parted lips redder than life itself--upon gleaming teeth on which glistened a rosy drop."" The situation is effectively dealt with according to the good old tradition. A hawthorn stake is driven through the heart of the vampire who emits a quantity of blood and with a despairing shriek dies the last death.

Almost equally vivid in its details must be accounted the tale, Four Wooden Stakes, by Victor Roman. The ghastly events in the lonely old house with its little grey crypt, some ten miles from the small town of Charing, a place of not more than fifteen hundred souls, are most vividly described. There lived the Holroyds, the grandfather, the father, and three brothers. Whilst in South America the grandfather ""was

p. 326

attacked while asleep by one of those huge bats. Next morning he was so weak be couldn't walk. That awful thing had sucked his life blood away. He arrived here, but was sickly until his death, a few weeks later."" So says Remson Holroyd, who is left the sole survivor of the family, and who has summoned his old college friend to help him solve the secret of the hideous doom which is taking toll one by one. The grandfather was not buried in the usual way; but, as his will directed, his remains were interred in the vault built near the house. Remson Holroyd continues: ""Then my dad began failing and just pined away until he died. What puzzled the doctors was the fact that right up until the end he consumed enough food to sustain three men, yet he was so weak he lacked the strength to drag his legs over the floor. He was buried, or rather interred with grand-dad. The same symptoms were in evidence in the cases of George and Fred. They are both lying in the vault. And now, Jack, I'm going, too, for of late my appetite has increased to alarming proportions, yet I am as weak as a kitten."" The next morning the visitor finds himself so weak that he is hardly able to rise and he feels a slight pain in the neck. ""I rushed to examine it in the mirror. Two tiny dots rimmed with blood--my blood--and on my neck! No longer did I chuckle at Remson's fears, for it, the thing, had attacked me--as I slept."" The host himself is in a state of utter exhaustion. That night watch is kept by the friend, and as from his concealment he is gazing into Remson's room he notices ""a faint reddish glow outside one of the windows. It apparently emanated from nowhere. Hundreds of little specks danced and whirled in the spot of light, and as I watched them fascinated, they seemed to take oil the form of a human face. The features were masculine, as was also the arrangement of the hair. Then the mysterious glow disappeared."" After a few moments there appears a vague form of which the watcher is able to distinguish the head, and to his horror he sees that the features are the same as those of a portrait of the grandfather which is hanging in the picture gallery of the house. ""But oh, the difference in expression! The lips were drawn back in a snarl, disclosing two sets of pearly white teeth, the canines over developed and remarkably sharp. The eyes, an emerald green in colour, stared in a look of consuming hate."" The horror is revealed. The house is infested by a vampire. In the morning

p. 327

the two friends visit the vault. ""As if by mutual understanding, we both turned toward the coffin on our left. It belonged to the grandfather. We unplaced the lid, and there lay the old Holroyd. He appeared to be sleeping; his face was full of colour, and he had none of the stiffness of death. The hair was matted, the moustache untrimmed, and on the beard were matted stains of a dull brownish hue. But it was his eyes that attracted me. They were greenish, and they glowed with an expression of fiendish malevolence such as I had never seen before. The look of baffled rage on the face might well have adorned the features of the devil in hell."" They drive a stake through the living corpse, which shrieks and writhes, whilst the gushing blood drenches coffins and floor spurting out in great jets over the very walls. The head is severed from the body, and as the final stroke of the knife cut the connexion a scream issued from the mouth; and the whole corpse fell away into dust, leaving nothing but a wooden stake lying in a bed of bones."" The remaining three bodies are treated in the same way, and thus the thrall of the curse is lifted from the old house, ten miles from the little town of Charing.

Although the genius of Charles Baudelaire, when his art required it, shrank from no extremity of physical horror, yet in his exquisite poem Le Vampire he has rather portrayed the darkness and desolation of the soul:

Toi qui, comme un coup de couteau,
Dans mon coeur plaintif est entrée;
Toi qui, forte comme un troupeau
De démons, vins, folle et parée.

De mon esprit humilié
Faire ton lit et ton domaine
--Infâme a qui je suis lié
Comme le forcat a la chaîne,

Comme au jeu le joueur têtu,
Comme à la bouteille l'ivrogne,
Comme aux vermines la charogne,
--Maudite, maudite sois-tu!

J'ai prié le glaive rapide
De conquerir ma liberté
Et j'ai dit au poison perfide
De secourir ma lâcheté.

p. 328

Helas! le poison et le glaive
M'ont pris en dédain et m'ont dit
Tu n'es pas digne qu'on t'enlève
A ton esclavage maudit.

Imbécile!--de son empire
Si nos efforts te délivraient,
Tes baisers ressusciteraient
Le cadavre de ton vampire!

In England there is a poem--truly of a very different kind--which appears in the life of the famous scientist, James Clerk Maxwell, by Lewis Campbell and William Garnett, verses written by Maxwell in 1845 when he was fourteen Years of age. The verses should not perhaps, because of the youth of the author, be criticized too sharply, and although they show Wardour Street fustian and gimcrack, since the piece is of no great length it may pardonably be quoted here. It is not entirely without a certain feeling after the right atmosphere, and much will be forgiven on account of the precocity. It is grandiosely entitled The Vampyre: Compylt into Meeter by James Clerk Maxwell.""

Thair is a knichte rydis through the wood,
And a douchty knichte is hee.
And sure bee is on a message sent,
He rydis sae hastilie.
He passit the aik, and hee passit the birk,
And bee passit monie a tre,
Bot plesant to him was the saugh sae slim,
For beneath it hee did see
The boniest ladye that ever hee saw,
Scho was sae schyn and fair.
And thair scho sat, beneath the saugh,
Kaiming hir gowden hair.
And then the knichte--""Oh ladye brichte,
What chance has broucht you here?
But sae the word, and ye schall gang
Back to your kindred dear,""
Then up and spok the ladye fair--
""I have nae friends or kin,
Bot in a little boat I live,
Amidst the waves' loud din.""
Then answered thus the douchty knichte""
I'll follow you through all,
For gin ye bee in a littel boat,
The world to it seemis small."" p. 329
They goed through the wood, and through the wood,
To the end of the wood they came:
And when they came to the end of the wood
They saw the salt sea faem.
And when they saw the wee, wee boat,
That daunced on the top of the wave,
And first got in the ladye fair,
And then the knichte sae brave.
They got into the wee, wee boat
And rowed wi' a' their micht
When the knichte sae brave, he turnit about,
And lookit at the ladye bricht

And bee lookit at hir twa bricht eyne,

And schoe seymit as scho deid had been.
The fause, fause knichte growe pale with frichte.
And his hair rose up on end,
For gane-by days cam to his mynde,
And his former love he kenned.
Then spake the ladye--""Thou, fause knichte,
Hast done to me much ill,
For didst forsake me long ago,
Bot I am constant still:
For though I ligg in the woods sae cald,
At rest I canna bee
Until I sucks the gude lyfe blude
Of the man that gart me dee.""

And hee saw hir lufolesse eyne,
And loud bee cry'd, ""get frae my syde,

But no, bee is in hir magic boat,
And on the wyde, wyde sea;
And the vampyr suckis his gude lyfe blude,
Sho suckis him till hee dee.
So now beware, whoe'er you are,
That walkis in this lone wood:
Beware of that deceitfull spright,
The ghaist that suckis the blude.

The Vampire Bride, a ballad by the Hon. Henry Liddell, has considerable merit, It may be found in The Wizard of the North, The Vampire Bride, and other Poems, Blackwood, Edinburgh, and Cadell, London, 1833. These stanzas are founded upon the old tale of the knight who having placed a ring--some say his wedding-ring--around the finger of the statue of Venus whilst he is a quoiting, when he would reclaim it

p. 330

finds that the finger is crooked so that the jewel may not be withdrawn, whilst that night a phantom claims him as her spouse. With difficulty is he freed from the thrall of the succubus.

In 1845 there was published at the Columbian Press Weston-super-mare, a little book entitled The Last of the Vampires, by Smyth Upton. The chief, some critics might say the only, merit of this tale is its excessive rarity. The narrative is somewhat curiously divided into Epochs, the first of which takes place in 1769, the second in 1777, the third and last in 1780. Chapter I opens in an English village named Frampton, but in Chapter II ""we find ourselves upon the borders of Bohemia"" in the Castle Von Oberfels. Four chapters of no great length and somewhat disconnected in their sequence comprise the First Epoch. A little later we meet with the mysterious Lord de Montfort, and apparently he has just committed a murder, since he is one of the two men who stand in a dreary outhouse adjoining Montfort Abbey. ""Red blood, yet warm, stains their murderous hands, and is seen also in pools upon the floor; the same marks are observable, also, on their clothes."" ""The scene is a fearful one; it is one of those of which the mere recital makes the blood run cold,"" and the writer wisely does not attempt the task. In the penultimate chapter of this extraordinary production we are introduced to ""a certain young German, the Baron Von Oberfels,"" who weds Mary Learmont, the elder daughter of ""Sir James Learmont, who being a Baronet, was, moreover, a Knight of the Bath and M.P."" Unfortunately the Baron ""was one of that horrible class, the Vampires! He had sold his soul to the evil one, for the enjoyment of perpetual youth; being bound, besides, to what are understood to be the penalties of that wretched and accursed race. Every tenth year a female was sacrificed to his infernal master. Mary Learmont was to be the next victim; may she escape the threatened doom."" But apparently, so far as I can gather, she is not so lucky for we are vaguely told ""The Baron and his bride departed on his wedding tour. Her father and mother never hear of her more."" A page or two later there is ""a midnight wedding"" at the Castle Von Oberfels. Of the bride we are told nothing save that she had a ""fair presence."" ""The Baron Von Oberfels was there, once more arrayed in the

p. 331

garments of a bridegroom."" The ceremony proceeds. The grand organ peals; the heavenly voices of white-robed choristers added greatly to the beauty of the scene. ""But hark! another noise is heard; sulphureous smoke half fills the sacred building; the floor opens for an instant; and mocking shrieks are audible as the spirit of the Last of the Vampires descended into perdition.""

I am bound to acknowledge that after a somewhat careful reading of this curious and most disjointed little piece of seventy-six pages the only impression with which I am met is that Mr. Smyth Upton knew nothing whatsoever of what the word vampire connotes. The idea of the victims who are sacrificed for the sake of eternal youth is, of course fairly common and was very effectively utilized by G. W. M. Reynolds in his romance The Necromancer, which ran in Reynolds's Miscellany from Saturday, 27th December, 1851, to Saturday, 31st July, 1852.[66] Incidentally it maybe remarked as a somewhat curious fact that this prolific novelist never availed himself of the vampire tradition in his melodramatic chapters.

The Vampyre. ""By the Wife of a Medical Man,"" 1858, is a, violent teetotal tract, of twenty-seven short chapters presented in the guise of fiction. The villain of the piece is ""The Vampyre Inn,"" and the dipsomaniac hero--if it be allowable to use the term in such a context--is given to ravings such as these: ""They fly--they bite--they suck my blood--I die. That hideous 'Vampyre!' Its eyes pierce me thro'--they are red--they are bloodshot. Tear it from my pillow. I dare not lie down. It bites--I die! Give me brandy--brandy--more brandy.""

A Vampire of Souls, by H. M. P., published in 1904, is a book of little value. The hero, George Ventnor, when aged twenty, is killed in a railway accident, and the narrative consists of his after experiences which are singularly material and crude. There is, perhaps, a good touch here and there, but the thing certainly does not deserve to be rescued from oblivion.

It will have been noticed that beyond the titles these two last works have really little or nothing to do with vampires at all, but we may now consider a romance which may at least be ranked as a very serious rival to--in my opinion it is far ghostlier than--its famous successor Dracula. Varney the Vampire, or, The Feast of Blood, is undoubtedly the best novel

p. 332

of Thomas Preskett Prest, a prolific writer of the fourth and fifth decades of the nineteenth century. It is true that his productions published by the well-known Edward Lloyd, of 231, Shoreditch,[67] may be classed as simple ""shockers,"" but none the less he has considerable power in this kind, and he had at any rate the craft of telling his story with skill and address. There is a certain quality in his work, which appeared during the years from 1839 to the earlier fifties, that is entirely lacking in the productions of his fellows. To him have been ascribed, doubtless with some exaggeration, well nigh two hundred titles, but the following list comprises, I believe, his principal romances: Ela, the Outcast, or, the Gipsy of Rosemary Dell; Angelina, or, the Mystery of S. Mark's Abbey, ""a Tale of Other Days ""; The Death Grasp, or, A Father's Curse; Ernnestine De Lacy, or, The Robbers' Foundling; Gallant Tom, or, The Perils of a Sailor Ashore and Afloat, ""an original nautical romance of deep and pathetic interest ""; Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street (the most famous of Prest's novels); Newgate (which has some capital episodes); Emily Fitzormond; Mary Clifford; The Maniac Father, or, The Victim of Seduction; Gertrude of the Rock; Rosalie, or, The Vagrant's Daughter; The Miller's Maid; Jane Brightwell; Blanche, or, The Mystery of the Doomed House; The Blighted Heart, or, The Priory Ruins; Sawney Bean, the Man-eater of Midlothian; The Skeleton Clutch, or, The Goblet of Gore; The Black Monk, or, The Secret of the Grey Turret[68]; The Miller and His Men, or, The Secret Robbers of Bohemia. To Prest also has been attributed, but I conceive without foundation, Susan Hoply, an audacious piracy upon the famous novel by Mrs. Crowe, Susan Hopley.

Varney the Vampire, or, The Feast of Blood, was first published in 1847. It contains no less than CCXX chapters and runs to 868 pages. The many incidents succeed each other with such breathless rapidity that it were well-nigh impossible to attempt any conspectus of the whole romance. The very length would make this analysis a work of extreme difficulty, and incidentally we may note the amazing copiousness of Prest which must ever remain a matter for wonderment. Such a romance, for example, as Newgate runs to no less than on, hundred and forty-nine chapters comprising 772 pages. The Maniac Father has fifty-four chapters, each of considerable

p. 333

length, which total 604 pages, and I have not selected these on account of their exceptional volume.

Varney the Vampire was among the most popular of Prest's productions, and on account of its ""unprecedented success"" it was reprinted in 1853 in penny parts. To-day the book is unprocurable and considerable sums have been for many years in vain offered to secure a copy. Indeed, it may be noted that all Prest's work is excessively scarce.

It is hardly an exaggeration to affirm that of recent years there have been few books which have been more popular than Brain Stoker's Dracula, A tale, and certainly there is no sensational romance which in modern days has achieved so universal a reputation. Since it was first published in 1897, that is to say one and twenty years ago, it has run into a great number of editions, and the name has veritably become a household word. It will prove interesting to inquire into the immediate causes which have brought this book such wide and enduring fame. It has already been remarked that it is well-nigh impossible for a story which deals with the supernatural or the horrible to be sustained to any great length. Elements which at first are almost unendurable, will lose their effect if they are continued, for the reader's mind insensibly becomes inured to fresh emotions of awe and horror, and Dracula is by no means briefly told. In the ordinary reprints (Tenth Edition, 1913) it extends to more than four hundred pages, nor does it escape the penalty of its prolixity. The first part, ""Jonathan Harker's Journal,"" which consists of four chapters is most admirably done, and could the whole story have been sustained at so high a level we should have had a complete masterpiece. But that were scarcely possible. The description of the journey through Transylvania is interesting to a degree, and even has passages which attain to something like charm. ""All day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind. Sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and running strong, to sweep the outside edge of a river clear."" Very effective is the arrival of the English traveller at the ""vast ruined castle, from, whose tall black windows came no ray of light, and whose

p. 334

broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky."" Very adroitly are the various incidents managed in their quick succession, those mysterious happenings which at last convince the matter-of-fact commonplace young solicitor of Exeter that he is a helpless prisoner in the power of a relentless and fearful being. The continual contrasts between business conversations, the most ordinary events of the dull listless days, and all the while the mantling of dark shadows in the background and the onrushing of some monstrous doom are in these opening chapters most excellently managed.

So tense a strain could not be preserved, and consequently when we are abruptly transported to Whitby and the rather tedious courtships of Lucy Westenra, who is a lay figure at best, we feel that a good deal of the interest has already begun to evaporate. I would hasten to add that before long it is again picked up, but it is never sustained in the same degree; and good sound sensational fare as we have set before us, fare which I have myself more than once thoroughly enjoyed, yet it is difficult not to feel that one's palate, has been a little spoiled by the nonpareil of an antipast. This is not to say that the various complications are not sufficiently thrilling, but because of their very bounty now and again they most palpably fail of effect, and it can hardly escape notice that the author begins to avail himself of those more extravagant details of vampirism which frankly have no place outside the stories told round a winter's hearth, It would have been better had he confined himself to those particulars which are known and accepted, which indeed have been officially certified and definitely proved. But to have limited himself thus would have meant the shortening of his narrative, and here we return to the point which was made above.

If we review Dracula from a purely literary point of approach it must be acknowledged that there is much careless writing and many pages could have been compressed and something revised with considerable profit. It is hardly possible to feel any great interest in the characters, they are labels rather than individuals. As I have said, there are passages of graphic beauty, passages of graphic horror, but these again almost entirely occur within the first sixty pages. There are some capital incidents, for example the method by which Lord p. 335 Godalming and his friend obtain admittance to No. 347 Piccadilly. Nor does this by any means stand alone.

However, when we have--quite fairly, I hope--thus criticized Dracula, the fact remains that it is a book of unwonted interest and fascination. Accordingly we are bound to acknowledge that the reason for the immense popularity of this romance, the reason why, in spite of obvious faults it is read and re-read--lies in the choice of subject and for this the author deserves all praise.

It might not have seemed that Dracula would have been a very promising subject for the stage, but nevertheless it was dramatized by Hamilton Deans and produced at the Wimbledon Theatre on 9th March, 1925. This version was performed in London at the Little Theatre, 14th February, 1927. On the preceding Thursday the Daily Mirror published a photograph of the late Mr. Brain Stoker accompanied by the following paragraphs. ""Herewith, one of the very few photographs of the late Brain Stoker, who, besides being Sir Henry Irving's manager for years, was an industrious novelist. As I have already said, a dramatic version of his most famous book, 'Dracula,' is to be done at the Little on Monday, and the scene of the Grand Guignol plays is appropriate, for the new piece, I hear, is so full of gruesome thrills that, in the provinces women having been carried fainting from the auditorium. Truly we take our pleasures sadly.

""The dramatic adaptation is by Hamilton Deans, whose grandfather, Colonel Deans, and the Rev. Abraham Stoker, Bram's father, lived on adjoining estates in County Dublin. Young Bram and Hamilton Deane's mother, then a young girl, were great friends. Stoker had the book 'Dracula' in his mind, and the young people used to discuss its possibilities. Strange that it should be young Hamilton Deane who has dramatized the book and brought the play to London.""

At the Little Theatre the cast of Dracula was as follows: Count Dracula, Raymond Huntley; Abraham van Helsing, Hamilton Deane; Dr. Seward, Stuart Lomath; Jonathan Harker, Bernard Guest; Quincey P. Morris, Frieda Hearn; Lord Godalming, Peter Jackson; R. M. Renfield, Bernard Jukes; The Warden, Jack Howarth; The Parlourmaid, Hilda Macleod; The Housemaid, Betty Murgatroyd; Mina Harker, Dora Mary Patrick.

p. 336

By no stretch could it be called a good play, whilst the presentation, at the best, can hardly be described as more than reasonably adequate. In one or two instances the effects, upon which so much depends and which obviously demanded the most scrupulous care, were so clumsily contrived as to excite an involuntary smile. ""It was only a step from the devilish to the ridiculous on Monday night,"" said the Era, 16th February, 1927. Very remarkable was a lady, dressed in the uniform of a hospital nurse who sat in the vestibule of the theatre, and it was bruited that her services were required by members of the audience who were overcome owing to the horrors of the drama. I can only say that I find this canard impossible to believe, quodcumque ostendis mihi sic, incredulus odi. As an advertisement, and it can surely have been nothing else, the attendance of a nurse was in deplorable taste. I am informed that after the first few weeks a kind of epilogue was spoken when all the characters were assembled upon the stage, and it was explained that the audience must not be distressed at what they had seen, that it was comically intended for their entertainment. So gross a lapse of good manners, not to speak of the artistic indecorum, is hardly credible.[69]

Confessedly the play was extremely weak, and yet such is the fascination of this subject that it had an exceptional success, and triumphantly made its way from theatre to theatre. On 25th July, 1927, Dracula was transferred to the Duke of York's; on the 29th August, following to the Prince of Wales, on 10th October to the Garrick; and all the while it was given to thronging houses. It has also toured, and at the present moment is still touring the provincial theatres with the most marked success, the drama being given with more spirit and vigour than originally was the case at the Little, and Wilfrid Fletcher in particular playing the lunatic Renfield with a real touch of wistful pathos and uncanny horror. This is is extremely instructive, and it is curious that the vogue of the ""vampire play"" in London should be repeated almost exactly after the interval of a century. On 5th November, 1927, a new version of Dracula by Charles Morrel was presented at the Court Theatre, Warrington.

In America the dramatization of Dracula was produced at the Shubert, New Haven, 19th September, 1927. This was given at the Fulton, New York, upon the following 5th October.

p. 337

Jonathan Harker was acted by Terence Neil; Abraham Van Helsing by Edward Van Sloan; Renfield by Bernard Jukes; and Count Dracula by Bela Lugoni .

As I have before remarked, the striking fact that an indifferent play should prove so successful can, I think, only be attributed to the fascination of the theme. Consciously or unconsciously it is realized that the vampire tradition contains far more truth than the ordinary individual cares to appreciate and acknowledge. ""La fable du vampire est peut-être, la plus universelle de nos superstitions. . . . Elle a partout l'autorité de la tradition: elle ne manque ni de cello de la philosophic ni de celle de la médicine. La théologie même en a parlé.""Embed"

[Verse 1: Chuck D]
I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
Here's your ticket;
Hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to Black attack
So I sack and jack, then slapped the Mac
Now I'm ready to mic it
(You know I like it) huh
Hear my favoritism roll ""Oh""
Never be a brother like, ""Me go solo""
Laser, anesthesia, maze ya
Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way I'm livin', forgiven, what I'm givin' up
X on the flex, hit me now
I don't know about later
As for now, I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man, I've had it up to here
Yeah, I wear got 'em going in fear
Rhetoric said and read just a bit ago
Not quitting, though signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from getting jerked
Checkin' some ways (Ways)
To way back in the better days
Raw metaphysically bold, never followed a code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am, God knows, huh!
'Cause it's coming from the heart
What I got, better get some
Get on up, hustler of culture
Snake bitten, been spit in the face, huh!
But the rhymes keep fittin'
Respect's been given, how's ya livin'
Now I can't protect, a paid-off defect
Check the record and reckon an intentional wreck
Played, off as some intellect
Made the call, took the fall, broke the laws
Not my fault that they're fallin' off
Known as fair and square throughout my years
So I growl at the livin' foul
Black to the bone, my home is your home
But welcome to the Terrordome

Yo, who you trust, man?

[Verse 2: Chuck D & Flavor Flav]
Subordinate terror, kickin' off an era
Cold deliverin' pain
My '98 was '87 on a record, yo
So now I go Bronco
(Oh Chuck, they out to get us, man!
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh Chuck, they out to get us, man!
Yo, we gotta dust these boys off!)
Crucifixion ain't no fiction
So-called chosen frozen
Apology made to whoever pleases
Still they got me like Jesus
I rather sing, bring, think, reminisce
'Bout a brother while I'm in sync
Every brother ain't a brother 'cause a color
Just as well could be undercover
Backstabbed, grabbed a flag from the back of the lab
Told a Rab get off the rag
Sad to say, I got sold down the river
Still some quiver when I deliver
Never to say I never knew or had a clue
Word was Herb, plus hard on the boulevard
Lies, scandalizin', basin'
Traits of hate, who's celebratin' with Satan?
I rope-a-dope the evil with righteous, bobbin' and weavin'
And let the good get even
C'mon down (C'mon!)
But welcome to the Terrordome

Come on down
Ohhh (Get down)

Come on down

[Verse 3]
Caught in the race against time, the pit and the pendulum
Check the rhythm and rhymes while I'm bending 'em
Snakes blowing up the lines of design (Would you join me please in welcome-in-ing...)
Trying to blind the science I'm sending 'em
How to fight the power, cannot run and hide
But it shouldn't be suicide
In a game, a fool without the rules
Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
Every brother ain't a brother
'Cause a black hand squeezed on Malcolm X the man
The shooting of Huey Newton
From a hand of a Nig who pulled the trig

[Interlude]
Come on down
Come on down

""Would you join me please in welcome-in-ing...""
[Verse 4]
It's weak to speak and blame somebody else
When you destroy yourself
First, nothin' worse
Than a mother's pain of a son slain in Bensonhurst
Can't wait for the state to decide the fate
So this jam I dedicate
Places with the racist faces
Example, one of many places
Greek, week-end, speech, I speak
From a lesson, learned in Virginia
I don't smile in the line of fire, I go wildin'
But it's on bass and drums, even violins
Whatcha do, getcha head ready
Instead of getting physically sweaty
When I get mad, I put it down on a pad, huh!
Give ya something that ya never had
Controllin', fear of high rollin'
God bless your soul and keep livin'
Never allowed, kickin' it loud
Droppin' a bomb, brain game, intellectual Vietnam
Move as a team, never move alone

I couldn't stop you from getting ganked
Now let's play big bank take little bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
'Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair? Nah, cut them balls
'Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Getting money out your ass like a motherfucking ready teller
Giving up the dollar bills
Now they got The Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
'Cause he's going out like Kunta Kinte
But I got a whip for you, Toby
Used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide and conquer
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yelling Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren
'Cause I remember when you drove a B210
Broke as a motherfucking joke
Let you on the scene to back up the first team
It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart
And they ripping your asshole apart
By taking your green
Oh, yeah, The Villain does get fucked with no Vaseline

I never have dinner with the president

I never have dinner with the president
And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half pint bitch, fucking your homeboys, you little maggot
Eazy-E turned faggot
With your manager, fella
Fucking MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me
Eazy-E would be hanging from a tree
With no Vaseline
Just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on
'Til that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation
Off the massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga, what you thinking 'bout?
Get rid of that devil real simple
Put a bullet in his temple
'Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white Jew telling you what to do
Pulling wools with your scams
Now I gotta play The Silence of the Lambs
With a midget who's a punk too
Tryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you

Giving voice to the flame
Calling you through flesh that burns
Breaking down your will

That has become now an open sore

It is a false messiah
It is the face of pain
The bringer of the bittersweet
The heretic insane

To break the walls

Taught to believe that it is the way
Taught to divide and exactly why

Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosa's Cantina
Music would play and Feleena would whirl

[Verse 2]
Blacker than night were the eyes of Feleena
Wicked and evil while casting her spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain, I could tell

[Chorus 1]
One night, a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Feleena, the girl that I love

[Verse 3]
So in anger, I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor
[Full-Length Version - Verse 4]
Just for a moment, I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul, evil deed I had done
Many thoughts raced through my mind as I stood there
I had but one chance, and that was to run

Out where the horses were tied

Up on its back, and away I did ride

From the West Texas town of El Paso
Out to the badlands of New Mexico

[Verse 5]
Back in El Paso my life would be worthless
Everything's gone in life, nothing is left
It's been so long since I've seen the young maiden
My love is stronger than my fear of death

[Chorus 3]
I saddled up, and away I did go
Riding alone in the dark
Maybe tomorrow a bullet may find me
Tonight, nothing's worse than this pain in my heart

[Verse 6]
And at last, here I am on the hill overlooking El Paso
I can see Rosa's Cantina below
My love is strong and it pushes me onward
Down off the hill to Feleena, I go
[Verse 7]
Off to my right I see five mounted cowboys
Off to my left ride a dozen or more
Shouting and shooting, I can't let them catch me
I have to make it to Rosa's back door

[Chorus 4]
Something is dreadfully wrong, for I feel
A deep burning pain in my side
Though I am trying to stay in the saddle
I'm getting weary, unable to ride

[Verse 8]
But my love for Feleena is strong, and I rise where I've fallen
Though I am weary, I can't stop to rest
I see the white puff of smoke from the rifle
I feel the bullet go deep in my chest

From out of nowhere, Feleena has found me
Kissing my cheek as she kneels by my side
Cradled by two loving arms that I'll die for
One little kiss, and Feleena, goodbye13Embed"

Well we both said, ""Hello""
There was nowhere else to go
'Cause his rent I couldn't afford

How money makes a man grow
Ah, some people they claim

You live over the rainbow, over the rainbow

Out on buses or on feet
We all got the same blood flow
Oh in society every dollar got a deed
We all need a place that we can go

I couldn’t hear my stage directions
And the fog on the windshield
Obscured our sad reflections

And the moonlight soaked the branches in ever-deepening degrees

If I were any older I would act my age

Only to vanish in the spring
It never fails to make him shiver
To see the outline of her wings

Where she made her last snow angel
Little did they know
That it’d make a lasting impression
Deeper than the snow
In his soul, snow angel never faded

And when love calls to make that promise
One to be faithful and be true
It’s then temptation falls upon us
The world turns awkward and aloof

And with this betrayal
An angel descended from on high
Oh, but this was not a manger
And as he came inside to his fright
T’was no angel hanging naked

Strange how each year ‘round late November
When the first snow is on the ground
She reappears so he’ll remember
How a love so young can be cut down?

867,ML868,Bruce Springsteen,War,angry,"[Intro]
If you grew up in the sixties
You grew up with war on TV every night
The war that your friends were involved in
And uh, I wanna do this song tonight for all the young people out there
If you're in your teens
'Cause I remember
A lot of my friends when we were seventeen or eighteen we didn't
Have much of a chance to think about how we felt about a lot of things
And uh, the next time
They're gonna be lookin' at you
And you're gonna need a lot of information to know
What you're gonna wanna do
Because in 1985
Blind faith in your leaders or in anything will get you killed
'Cause what I'm talkin' about here is

[Chorus]
War, huh (Yeah yeah yeah)
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Say it again

Absolutely nothing

War is something that I despise
For it means the destruction of innocent lives
And thousand words in mothers' cry
When their sons go out to fight to give their lives

Handed down from generation to generation

War has shattered many young men's dreams
Made them disabled, bitter and mean
Life is too precious to be fighting wars each day
War can't give life, it can only take it away

War, huh (Oh oh yeah)
What is it good for?
Absolutely nothing
Say it again

Killing Dracula MC's who bit from my vernacular

I'm makin' devils cower to the Caucasus Mountains

Except she got a little more ass

Unless you've got that thing she likes
Ooh, I hope she's goin' home with me tonight

881,ML882,Cradle of Filth,Lovesick for Mina,angry,"One might see in Mina my disease
But it was She who has infected me for all eternity

As the sun slips the tearaway stars
Into the scented scheme of night
I kissed her mouth like a dark red rose
Set upon a marbled dream of white
So pure of thought like a Vestal statue
Jewelled with a God-lent grace
I was close to coming when she bid adieu
Fuelled by heartache rent upon her face there

Oh Mina, obscener
Thoughts obsess my days
Oh Mina, obscener
Thoughts possess me
That I must now obey

They say the darkest hour is that before the dawn
When nothing in one's power can dissipate the great forlorn
Shadows of fire that haunt me
Like risen whispers of her name
For dawn is a dusk wherein needs must
Erupt from the grave, aflame

Written in the dead of night, dead of night
And riding on the burning wind
Smitten by her read delight, read delight
My words alight like leaves of sin
You might also likeStepping through a mirror
The princess of the emerald glass
Brought me one step nearer
Love's infernal past

They say Hell hath no furies like a woman scorned by life
When the Heavenly Judge and juries participate to chain this wife
With forced virtue Her secret needs drew on my foreign blood
On warm we nights with storm-wracked bites I gave her Eden after the flood

Written in the dead of night, dead of night
And riding on the burning wind
Smitten by her read delight, read delight
My words alight like leaves of sin

Verona, Marishka, Aleera
Brides of old and goddesses all
Forgive my wishes to be always near her
Forever or whenever seas recall

The Aphrodite from my embrace
For as Mars whom her lips placate
I tore these shores with wars of hatred
Before our Paris set his fate
In Helen, one might find mistake
In winning tragedy for all eternity
I am still lovesick for Mina
I am still so lovesick for her
I am still lovesick for Mina
I am still so lovesick for herEmbed"

Holy hot rocks, I'm hot, so give up the props
My style is hummin', comin' at ya, duck or get backed up
Dispatcher, ""Red, get freaky to the rapture""
So come on light the buddha, check your honey while I scoop her

Then hook off on your crew, to the check a-one, two

And she's quivering with fright
Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes x4
The doctors are avoiding me
My vision is confused
I listen to my earphones
And I catch the evening news
A murderer's been killed
And he donates his sight to science
I'm locked into a private ward
I realise that I must be
Looking through Gary Gilmore's eyes x4

I smash the light in anger
Push my bed against the door
I close my lids across the eyes
And wish to see no more
The eye receives the messages
And sends them to the brain
No guarantee the stimuli
Must be perceived the same way

913,ML914,Bright Eyes,Classic Cars,relaxed,"She was a real royal lady, true patron of the arts
She said the best country singers die in the back of classic cars
So if I ever got too hungry for a suitcase or guitar
To think of them all alone in the dark
So I laid some nights beside her in a bed made for a queen
She said I kissed her different, that all the men her age were mean
Gave me anything I wanted, oh the generosity
I took all that I could, it was free

Now the sky's a torn-up denim and the clouds are just splattered paint
It's a room I'm renovating; it's a name I got to change
If I get out of California, I'm going back to my home state
To tell them all that I made a mistake

And I keep looking for that blindfold faith
Lighting candles to a cynical saint
Who wants the last laugh at the fly trapped in the windowsill tape
You can go right out of your mind trying to escape
From the panicked paradox of day to day
If you can't understand something then it's best to be afraid
The whole world it loves you if you're a chic chameleon
Intersecting circles, she could hang with anyone
But when conducting business she would lie about where she's from
Saying, ""Life is how it is not how it was""
You might also likeI learned to listen, felt like I was back at school
She'd talk forever about the phases of the moon
Saying, ""Everything is a cycle, you've got to let it come to you
And when it does, you will know what to do""

Without even knowing, I guess I took up her advice
Painted her front door, it seemed a suitable goodbye
It's not that often but I think of her sometimes
Just something quaint, a couple ships in the night

And they keep moving at a glacial pace
Turning circles in a memory maze
I made a new cast of the death mask that's gonna cover my face
I had to change the combination to the safe
Hide it all behind a wall, let people wait
And never trust a heart that's so bent it can't break1Embed"

But my mind was ill at ease
They were coming to take it away that afternoon
I was all by myself in a mellow mood
Improvising symphonies
My right hand was playing Mozart's minuet
And at the same time my left hand was playing; have a banana; from Carmen
And at the same time my mouth was whistling a sextet from Luicini
And at the same time What do you think my foot was doing?
While keeping time it was cracking walnuts; see I had to eat too
Then in the midst of all soliloquy
I found it, I found it
The Lost Chord, The Lost Chord!
So let's celebrate I'm feeling great
I'm the guy that found the Lost chord
I'll have my name in the hall of fame; cos I went and found that lost chord

Everyone knows Tchaikovsky wasn't recognised for 300 years
Brahms wasn't recognised for 400 years
Beethoven wasn't recognised for 500 years
But I can't wait that long I've only got two changes of clothes!

They said Mozart was mad
They said Puccini was mad
They said Louis was mad

Then I put a B minor with and F major
Then I put and F minor with a B major
Then I tried an A and a B and a B and a C
And a C and a D and a D and E and an E and a F

She told me that you made some money
You got yourself framed on the wall
And people come by and they look at your face
And they say it's the fairest of all
Of course you protest, that's what you do best
And you're modest and shy to the end
You're watching them as they're looking at you
And you know it was money well spent

She told me you'd given up drinking
To be with somebody you knew
And you tried to get into the Bible
But it never got into you
You've still got some loyal disciples

It sounds so foolish if I even try
Love is an arrow and it points at you
It tells you what you gotta do

Love is a verb and a noun as well
You find it in a dictionary under 'L'
To give you a description to spell it out
But they don't say what it's all about

Love is a fire that you can't control
It burns in the middle and it leaves a hole
You can fill it up and you don't know when
It's gonna start to burn again

Love is a good way to lose a friend
It's a two-faced liar that you can't defend
Love is a virus that invades your heart
It starts to take it all apart

Love is a shape that you can't define
With an odd set of angles and uneven sides
Your head's that paper and your hearts the pen

Upon that spot as upon all
And the wind would pass me by

To the terror of the lone lake

The last time I saw Richard was Detroit in '68
And he told me, ""All romantics meet the same fate someday
Cynical and drunk and boring someone in some dark café
""You laugh,"" he said, ""you think you're immune
Go look at your eyes, they're full of moon
You like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell you
All those pretty lies, pretty lies
When you gonna realize they're only pretty lies?
Only pretty lies, just pretty lies""

[Verse 2]
He put a quarter in the Wurlitzer
And he pushed three buttons and the thing began to whirr
And a bar maid came by in fishnet stockings and a bow tie
And she said ""Drink up now, it's gettin' on time to close.""
""Richard, you haven't really changed,"" I said, it's just that
Now you're romanticizing some pain that's in your head
You got tombs in your eyes, but the songs you punched are dreamy
Listen, they sing of love so sweet, love so sweet
When you gonna get yourself back on your feet?
Oh and love can be so sweet, love so sweet

[Verse 3]
Richard got married to a figure skater
And he bought her a dishwasher and a coffee percolator
And he drinks at home now most nights with the TV on
And all the house lights left up bright

951,ML952,Jens Lekman,Friday Night at the Drive-In Bingo,happy,"[Verse 1]
In a tiny, tiny southern Swedish country town
Two acres of field and a gas station
Riding on my moped, looking for fun
Staring into the blood red sun
On the country road is a boulevard
With neon lights and night open bars
In my jacket a pack of playing cards
Just jacks, jokers, and the queen of hearts

[Chorus]
My heart is beating
Beating like Ringo
As I pull into the drive-in bingo

[Verse 2]
Why do the people in the country want to look like the people in the city
When the people in the city aren't the slightest pretty?
I want the people in the country to wear flannel shirts and saggy jeans all covered in dirt
I want the people in the country to be open and kind
But most times I've met those with a narrow mind
With a big black dog to bite your behind
If they ever find out you're not one of their kind

[Chorus]
All these thoughts as I open up a Zingo
Friday night at the drive-in bingo

So this is what they do out here for fun?
They play bingo and let their engines run?
Tonight's jackpot is a pig, hey that's criminal!
G-42! Ooh, I'm going diagonal!
I'm gonna gather up a few of my friends
As many fits into an army tent
Just bring our savings and a bottle of wine
To the Friday night's reversal of time!

[Verse 3]
This little south-west village shouldn't cost that much
Maybe a handful of silver or a hundred bucks
We could have wild, wild parties in that big old lodge
And the windmill's perfect for movies and such
We could fake our deaths to get insurance money
And take on hippie names, I'd be Snowphish, you'd be Sunny
We could start a little farm with little white bunnies
Just because watching them copulate is very funny
There's a cow and an ostrich just waiting for you!
A glass of apple cider just waiting for you!
The smell of 1952 just waiting for you!
And all I'm doing here is just waiting for you...

A daydream, I'm caught up in limbo
Friday night at the drive-in bingoEmbed"

And make you holla still

Never gonna live in no lavish spot
Always gonna live at home with mom and pop

Hopefully radio plays this I doubt it though
Yo pass that Olde English

Sometimes I feel like I party way too much
Premieres openings and shows and such but
What else is a girl to do
Go home by myself at 2

I'm doin the same stupid shit and it's day in day out
I know that there's gotta be a way out
But I keep drinking and I just stay out
At the hot spots with superstars and the hardrocks
I wish that I could disappear to the boondocks

Maybe if I socialize I'll feel alright but those
Never seem to be the best laid plans
Never did I dream I'd go to foreign lands I just
Wanna lay in creamy sands
Doing nothin all day with my dreamy man maybe
Buy that house across from the projects
So I can stay trading gossip like stock tips

These are the days that I won't get back
Won't hear you cry or hear you laugh
When it's quiet I don't hear a thing
I can always hear you breathe

You know there's nowhere else that I've wanted to be
But be there when you need me
I'm sorry too but don't give up on me

Yo word up, get the fucking mop!
We about to leave all your FUCKING blood on the floor!
Bitch we will...

When Mr. Hyde enters the room you'll reside inside a tomb
When I off you with the blade in a coffin's where you stay
There ain't a fucker rough enough or tough enough to step it
And God forbid you knuckle up you'll probably get snuffed to death
A hook up right in they left my juks will spike in your flesh
But you received it like a man and took it right in your chest
Y'all are thinking that you're thugs I'mma split open your jugs
Rather spit at you with slugs than kick and get blood on my Lugs
Never acted fucking nice, like to hack and cut, and slice
So if you front it's logical that I attack you with a knife
I stay strapped and shady cause I'm packing a 380
After life decision makers wanna banish me to Hades
But I'm still gripping the heat spraying off a pound of shells
Gonna need a thicker leash to restrain the hounds of Hell
See my bloody fists'll drip then I'll add like 50 kicks
To your cranium I'm Damien with the biscuit itch

And if you disrespect you'll probably see a troop of kids
They'll be marching to your door strapping hard to start a war

With the parasite attached to me
I had hoped the salt below
Would divorce what was wed above

But league after league
It yet remained
For the fleshy vessel I
Kept it sustained
And so we froze a while surrounded by one big tear
Which only reminded me of a former home
But we weren't welcome
The sea made that clear
By filling us with saline
And sailing us blue blue back into
The atmosphere

""You choked as you surfaced, tangled in seaweed""

But what remained?
Of the driving intent?
That led me to tract such watery depths
Many things have betrayed me

[Intro]
One time
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee, I ducked, could it be my time is up?
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I shoot back, fuck gettin' hit
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it
'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon, sent from the stars, sun and the moon
In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience leavin' victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die with nines out

All I need is one blunt, one page and one pen
One prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter fact, maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me, fuck all of them
Jesus died at age thirty-three, there's thirty-three shots
From twin Glocks, there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two
Which means one of my guns was holdin' seventeen
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggas roll up shootin' from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, two mini nines
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way, they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now
[Chorus]
All I need is one mic (That's all I need, niggas, that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (There's nothin' else in the world)
All I need is one mic (That's all a nigga need to do his thing, you know?)
All I need is one mic (This is all I need)

[Verse 3]
All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is, niggas'll move on you
Only if they know what your weakness is, I have none
Too late to grab guns, I'm blastin' 'cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards
Drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a cop'll get killed, body found in a dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggas throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous 'cause fiends got they work and complained
Bitches left me 'cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true, she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon 'cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found
You need some soul-searchin', the time is now

All I need is one mic (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

With no way to hold my head, that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad
So I had one more for dessert
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day

I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and the songs I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playin' with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's fryin' chicken
And it took me back to somethin'
That I'd lost somewhere, somehow along the way

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned
Cause there's something in a Sunday
That makes a body feel alone
And there's nothin' short of dyin'
That's half as lonesome as the sound
Of a sleepin' city sidewalk
And Sunday mornin' comin' down

With a laughin' little girl that he was swingin'

And it echoed thru the canyon
Like the disappearing dreams of yesterday

On a Sunday morning sidewalk
I'm wishing Lord that I was stoned

And even on the darkest night, she can't deny

That nothing else exists

Beyond his own two sails and wooden shell
And what is held within
All else is sure to pass, we clutch and grasp
And debate what's truly permanent
But when the wind starts to shift
Well, there's no argument

Now, I sing and drink and sleep on floors

I exchange thoughts with the clouds
I hold my breath
Ahh, it's just hard shell you can't see
Is that where the bottom is? The shadow burns me
Ahh, I just want to keep forgetting
Slip your desires into the ants' nest
Come now, all you have to do now is be reborn again

Let tomorrow sleep and peacefulness will turn to you
Free yourself and go with your razor sharp emotions
Even the twisted flow is the proof that you are alive
I invite the tearfully-indulging tomorrow

The inculcated Dogra Magra
The pain of the mark and the one and only personality
And those colorful eyes all decorated I don't want them anymore
Is hypocrisy going to come and take it away?
The lonely red stage at night
I dedicate the following to the aspiring leading actor
That's where the truth is

The small corner of my un-cheatable heart says ""I still want to be here""
Who can't we forgive?
I let them hear my cold voice
And i swear

I will live with my work I scream with this body of flesh that separates heaven and hell
I carve the sins What will be the proof of my existence if it disappears with the wind?

""I've stared at the strong shining moon long enough to be bored
Can't even turn myself into a werewolf
But just enough to become crazy by the darkness
I want to suck the neck
The emptiness of the remains
I won't let you sleep
At the age where you just want attention...tonight I might go crazy for you.""

Everyone wants to reach out their hand and grab happiness
But they just end up becoming the monster that lies deep in darkness
The end has already come to life
It will take form at zero and will crawl back into the uterus and rot
Every time this happens your faces crumble

No one wants to talk about truth that hurts the ear
The suppressed minds

Compensate the sins and let life be gone

The emptiness of the antithesis
Becomes the choking and crying land
Bury the bones in the common land immersed in thesis
Be burdened by depression
The gritty tsunami takes me away and I smile with bitter tears
Couldn't understand the value of things
The hanging of the necks at the 13 stairs
Seeing people becoming friendly while clapping hands
That mixes in with sissy thoughts and hurts others
Seeing you like this it's just too sad

Splash of blood
Squashing basic instincts
Talk about death

I will live with my work I scream with this body of flesh that separates heaven and hell
I carve the sins. What will be the proof of my existence if it disappears with the wind?

No one wants to talk about the truth that hurts the ear
The suppressed minds

Compensate the sins, and let life be gone

Is it a sin for me to live because I am evil?Embed"

And so I pray every night

Something knows me
It whispers my name
And I'm losing my faith

But it feels like something dead and cold

I can feel it waiting
But it waits for something in my soul

Sometimes I call out for you, and sometimes I'm afraid

So I beg God
For salvation, for an angel
Every night

And I ask God
Can He forgive me?
And I want to believe

1041,ML1042,Bauhaus,The Three Shadows Part 2,sad,"1 ContributorMarking Time LyricsThe Marked was ahead of it’s time in a few novel ways…although generally unsuccessful and clumsy in our attempts, we did our best to blend really loud guitar with 80’s English, alternative rock in a more forceful way then what had been popular at that time…our mixture of 60’style paisley fed psyche-a-delia, in itself not unique (with handy “spacey” lyrics), was played with such overdriven frenzy that this common influence almost became mystical in feel…as is often the case, young bands take what they “think” they hear, and play their music in such an aggressive manner that it transforms into something new…we had grasped our obvious influences (Love and Rockets, Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Cure, Joy Division/New Order) and mashed them together with earlier teenage crushes (Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, AC/DC) into a manner that was distinctly and brutally American… we had had something, however small, but of course it is 1986, almost a full 5 years before grunge would blow the doors wide open offa good ol’ rock ‘ roll…

Not only was The Marked my first real band (for all of just 9 interesting months), but it was also my social circle…Ron the drummer was my best friend, and the band breaking up essentially means, for the most part, losing him and his world…living with my father so far out west, away from the lake is isolating (the ‘cool people’ tend to live by the clubs in Lakeview)...plus being back in Chicago means not just the indignity of starting over musically, but also of trying to find some new people to meet and places to go…

Before I had moved to Florida, the place to see live music was the Cabaret Metro…the owner Joe Shanahan had turned the former bathhouse into the best venue in the city to see new alternative bands (long before the internet, your best chance to meet people who looked like you (weird) and thought like you (crazy) was at shows)…the year before (in 1985), I had had the chance to see the very first tour of The Jesus and Mary Chain…the Metro was absolutely packed to the gills as the Mary Chain had created such a huge buzz coming off their now seminal record ‘Psychocandy’…anticipating the large crowd, I arrived early enough so that I would get a chance to get a good spot on the floor and see the band up close…just before they came on, I noticed a small girl just behind my left shoulder, whose view of the stage was obscured by my height…I turned to her and said “you can stand in front of me if you like so you can see better”…she look surprised, smiled and said shyly “thanks a lot”, and nudged past me in the dense crowd…she was beautiful, lean, with an incredible face like a 20’s movie star, with long, wavy hair, and seemed young…I stared at this stranger during the whole concert (all 35 minutes of it!), and was sad to see her go when it was over because I had never seen anyone who even remotely looked like her in the flesh…also in that same period (again at the Metro/1985), I saw a punk band called Product 19 on a $3 show with other young local bands…I sat up in the balcony and watched their striking looking lead singer deliver an incredible, passionate performance that seemed beyond his years and far above the rowdy mentality of the young crowd…I bought their tape at that show, because I thought to myself that night that this singer (and the band) was going somewhere…without knowing it then, the simple act of getting out of the way for that little girl, and my random interest in an obscure local band, would change my life forever…

Because Chicago is a city of neighborhood bars and clubs (and the competition between them is fierce), owners tend to be very strict about underage drinkers…this severely limits my social sphere, because almost everything is 21 , and there are very few all-ages places to hang out…outside of the occasional all ages at the Metro, the only other place in town is Medusas…since it is my ‘only’ choice, I head back there to see if I can find any old friends and hopefully make some new ones…I meet a girl named Helen, who is a hairdresser a few years older than me…Helen, like me, grew up in the suburbs (she still lived at home), and comes down to the city on the weekends to hang out…we become friends, and because there is nothing romantic between us, feel comfortable going places together and talking on the phone all the time (back then, alternative type people were so far and few between that it is common that you might be the only person in your town with a funny haircut)…Helen becomes my late night phone buddy, as she is a very articulate and wry soul who, whenever I am around, makes me feel better about myself…Helen talks a lot about her boyfriend, who works the night shift and never gets a chance to come out…like her, he also lives in the suburbs, and through Helen I get to know all about this person without actually meeting him…his name is Lenny, and apparently he is a musician, a goth like her…I tell Helen that I would like to meet this “Lenny”, so there is a bit of connection there before we actually finally do…

The first thing that struck me about Lenny was how old and young he looked at the same time…he has one of those rough, handsome faces that seems like its from some distant tribe of long forgotten warriors…the second thing I notice about Lenny is he is the singer from the punk band Product 19!…when I had last seen him (playing), his hair was chopped into a crew cut, and he was dressed like a working class yob…but now he had long, dyed black hair and is wearing the standard issue black trench coat…I immediately launch into how great his band is, and how I had seen the show the year before and was so impressed I bought the tape…Lenny laughs and says that he appreciates what I am saying but the band has broken up…he is not into that stuff anymore (meaning punk), and is sorta in a new band that is more gothic…he says he had recently done a few loft shows with a couple of other guys from the burbs, but that one of the guys had already quit or wasn’t into it or something unclear…he suggests that maybe we could get together and work on some stuff…the fact that I already have respect for Lenny as an artist makes his offer really attractive…plus, he turns out to be a really great guy…

I get the chance to know Lenny for a time as a friend before we ever make any music together…he is a tender soul who lives with his mom, and is one of those guys who still resides at home more so because he wants to be there to help her out as opposed to some loser who just can’t get it together (like me)…Lenny has a real job…he earns what seems to me like a ton of money, drives a BMW, and actually seems like an adult (he is just a few years older than me)…he lives out in God knows where, and in order to get over to his house I have to try to borrow somebody’s car for the day cause it’s just so far…sometimes Lenny is even nice enough to come and pick me up at my dad’s, drive me out to his house, and then take me back the next day…we start making demos on Lenny’s 4-track cassette, which is a much nicer model than mine…Lenny plays bass, so the general idea is: let’s write a new song together, he’ll do his thing, I will do mine (which is at this point very minimal, plinky guitar), and one of us can sing the song (probably whoever writes the lyrics)…it is fun working this way, and each time we get together, we easily manage to come up with a new idea, sometimes two… there is no stress or disagreements because we want the same thing, which is to sound like a general mix of our favourite stuff: Gene Loves Jezebel, the Mission, Cocteau Twins, in addition to the usual suspects—Cure, Siouxsie, Bauhaus…there is no master plan, no talk of taking over the world, we don’t really even think in terms of even having a band…we are just having a good time and making music that is close to our hearts…I’m encouraged, because the songs are definitely a step up from the Marked’s material and some of my songwriting work is paying off…I am slowly gaining confidence that I can write a decent song if I put my mind to it…

One day, Lenny brings up the name of the other guy he was playing in that band with, not from Product 19, but the alternative group which had never even been named…he asks if I mind if he invites the guy over, that maybe he can join us in our songwriting and demo sessions…apparently his friend is also in another band, but since those band members are going to college now, he’s is looking for something to do…the guy I end up meeting is female skinny, with the subtle hints of a new wave haircut (but one that could easily be turned back into a normal college guy hairdo at anytime)…he lives at home with his parent (he never left), and is going to school…he has a nice new telecaster, much nicer than my ratty mustang…everything about this guy screams mama’s boy (he is too clean!), but he seems nice enough…the 3 of us put our heads together and record a song I wrote on the spot, a New Order rip called “Now that I feel this way” (it has 2 chords and 2 parts)…Lenny’s friend immediately plays some stuff that goes well with my guitar part, a surprise to me because it is an instant complimentary language to the one I am speaking…the click is there right-straight-away, and where Lenny and I previously on our songs had captured a sort of imitative smile, this guy brings the energy in the room up a notch instantly and makes my new idea sound more original, and thereby more appealing…which is great…this creates a general excitement between us, which is hard to describe correctly considering we are in a normal bedroom, in a normal suburban house on a uneventful evening like any other (in God knows where)…but there is enough spark there that we decide that the 3 of us should get together and write again real soon…

Back at home, life is in it’s normal chaos…my father’s drug problems are interwoven into the fabric of our life to the point where it is like standing next to a roaring 747 and pretending that there is no noise…it is occasionally joked about (he smokes a lot of pot, like 8-10 joints a day), but the general vibe is don’t ask, don’t see, don’t tell…I have been dealing with this for so long---the coke mirrors, the drug buddies, the middle of the night phone calls, the sudden disappearances, the ‘no money’ blues, the locked doors, that I don’t even think about it…it is as blue as the blue sky…we live together, but our relationship is more like 2 bachelors than father and son…he does his thing, I do mine…we talk here and there, and sometimes the conversation drifts into the red zone of our past: my step-mother, my disabled brother, my mom, his behaviour…my father listens, but usually cuts me off with a soliloquy about how no matter what adversities I have faced, he has faced worse and his problems are bigger than mine…money continues to be an issue for me, and since I have few resources, talk to my dad about what I might do…he tells me maybe I should cut my hair and get a real job (something he has never really done)…he brings up the spector of my inheritance, which I got from my grandmother when she passed away from cancer (I was 17---she had left me 1/3 of her house in a trust)…my dad mentions that since it has been over 2 years since she died (and now a legal adult), maybe I owe some taxes and I should check with my aunt and her brother, my uncle (the other 2/3’s), to see if I owe them any back taxes…he says something along the lines that ‘maybe if you neglect this, she will screw you out of your share and you’ll have shit’ (my aunt and I had recently had a basic falling out over the way I looked)…I call up my aunt right then and there…she is an imposing woman of around 300 pounds who everyone calls ‘Butch’…I explain my fear, and ask gingerly if there are any responsibilities to the property that I have that I should know about, and also, can she send me a copy of the will…without a seconds hesitation, she totally goes nuclear on me, calling me a “lazy bastard like your father” and hissing “I always knew you were a conniver!” (she had never spoken to me like this before, ever)…since my grandma had passed away, her apartment on the 1st floor had remained vacant,…because I was hard up, I had in the recent past asked my aunt if I could stay there, which I was told was not possible (even though I owned as much of the house as her!)…I had even asked her if there was a way I could take a loan out against my share of the house, to which she absolutely refused…so now, in the heat of the moment, these subjects which had lain dormant for some time now all came roaring back…she cursed at me like a drunken sailor and told me that as far as she was concerned, I would never stay at my grandma’s house ever again, that I had no right to the house on any level, and if I wanted even a single penny from my inheritance I would have to sue!! (an absolute nightmare scenario)…here and then, my relationship with my aunt and uncle, who have been in my life from the day I was born, ends over money, and to this day 18 years later, I still have not spoken to any of them, nor do I even know if they are alive…

As always, women float in and out of my life, often without direction or clear purpose…my former girlfriend still hovers in the picture, albeit angrily on her part (she had originally made the trip to Florida, lasting only two weeks---more on that later)…I occasionally fool around with a high school friend who I never had anything to do with physically during school, but now occasionally get together with for a roll in the hay to stave off loneliness (it makes me sad that we do this, but there is a silent agreement that we won’t judge each other for it, and tell no one)…I might pursue someone I had dated before, but she is back with her old boyfriend…so I don’t really have a girlfriend, just these random relationships of attraction and distraction that are going nowhere fast…so it is not that unusual for me to go out with my former girlfriend to see a concert…we are no longer an ‘official’ couple, but the general tensions still exist about ‘will we, won’t we’, and whoever she might be sleeping with that I don’t know about…we make a date and get all dressed up to go to the Metro to see Peter Murphy, the former lead singer of Bauhaus…after the show is over, as I am heading down the stairs, a bleach blonde girl with a crew cut rushes up to me and presses a piece of paper in my hand…I don’t recognize her at first, but it turns out it is the beautiful 1920’s girl that I had stared at at the Jesus and Mary Chain show (she had chopped off all her hair)…because I am with my ex-girlfriend, and the rules still apply, I don’t really know what to do but say “hi” and keep moving with the crowd…her number burns a hole in my pocket over the next few days, but I am not sure if I should call her…just a few days later, I accidentally run into this same girl at a party as she leaving on her way down the stairs as I was just coming up…I see her, and we stop for a awkward second in a “hey, how’s it goin’, oh, where you going?” “oh, I’m just leaving with my friends, ah, bye” moment…I take this as a sign of destiny, and realize then I will call her first thing tomorrow…Embed"

Flowing in your veins
Are you insane?
At your mercy, they suffered
While you sat there painless
Vile and shameless
Crowned you are now
For the merciless sins

Is where blood flows through you

I'm going back to all those wasted years

We'll frolic in the pesticided grass beneath the smog
Don't gotta worry 'bout bee stings

And dance that cartoon dance

We will stroll downtown
Past messengers on bicycles
And men dressed up in gowns

I hope that it's not crowded so we can sit up front
I can't even see them scrape the sky
Blurring the fashions whizzing by
Sun gets down in the evening
Lights start flashing on

The nightlife has begun
Kustle and bustle
So many sites to see
Endless excitement
Keeps me up 'till three
Don't wanna go to the movies

Don't want to wait in line

Something that would make me never want another
Something that would make it so that nothing mattered
All would be clear then

And watch it all dissolve into a single second
And try to write it down into a perfect sonnet
Or one foolish line

Cause that's all that you'll get so you'll have to accept
You are here then you're gone
But I believe that lovers should be tied together
Thrown into the ocean in the worst of weather
And left there to drown
Left there to drown in their innocence

Thrown into a fire with their songs and letters
And left there to burn
Left there to burn in their arrogance
But as for me I'm coming to my final failure
Killed myself with changes trying to make things better
Ended up becoming something other than what I had planned to be

One little smile, and after a while, a longing to forget
One little heartache left as a token
One little plaything carelessly broken

Remember the night
The night you said, ""I love you""
Remember?

Remember you vowed
By all the stars above you
Remember?

Remember we found a lonely spot
And after I learned to care a lot

You promised that you'd forget me not
But you forgot
To remember

You loved me too, my dreams had come true, and all the world was
May
But soon the Maytime turned to December

Right here on the ocean floor
Such wonderful things surround you
What more is you lookin' for?

While we devotin', full time to floatin'

Guess who's gon' be on the plate?

[English translation]
A figure lay there on the hilltop
So evil that the flowers around withered
A gloomy soul lay there on the hilltop
So cold that the water turned to ice

A shadow then settled over the woods
Then the figure's soul withered away
Because the figure's soul was a shadow

A witness to the slit wrist
As we move into '92
Still in a room without a view
Ya got to know, ya got to know
That when I say go, go, go
Amp up and amplify, defy
I'm a brother with a furious mind
Action must be taken
We don't need the key, we'll break in
Something must be done
About vengeance, a badge and a gun
'Cause I'll rip the mic, rip the stage, rip the system

The carnival drums all mad in the air
Grim reapers and skeletons and a missionary bell
Oh, where do we go now but nowhere?
In a colonial hotel we fucked up the sun
And then we fucked it down again
Well, the sun comes up and the sun goes down
Going 'round and around to nowhere
The kitten that padded and purred on my lap
Now swipes at my face with the paw of a bear
I turn the other cheek and you lay into that
Oh, where do we go now but nowhere?

Breathing tea and biscuits and the Serenity Prayer
While the bones of our child crumble like chalk
Oh, where do we go now but nowhere?
I remember a girl so bold and so bright
Loose-limbed and laughing and brazen and bare
Sits gnawing her knuckles in the chemical light
Oh, where do we go now but nowhere?

Ravaged avenger with a clip in your hair
Full of glass and bleach and my old razorblades

Gloomily and mournfully we go 'round again
And one more doomed time and without much hope
Going 'round and around to nowhere
From the balcony we watched the carnival band
The crack of the drum, a little child did scare
I can still feel his fingers pressed in my hand
Oh, where do we go now but nowhere?
If I could relive one day of my life
If I could relive just a single one
You on the balcony, my future wife
Oh, who could have known but no one?

1131,ML1132,Arab Strap,New Birds,sad,"You just have to be sure you're doing the right thing. I mean it's very easy to forget - she was just sitting there in the pub with her new friends and her new life and her new hair, and it might have been five years but you'd know just to look at her

I wasn't even sure it was her at first; I was ready to walk away but she smiled and called me over and we said hello for a bit. When we went back to our tables we were trying not to look over at each other and told our friends to stop staring. I didn't see her for the rest of the night, but by closing time the beer's kicked in so I go up and speak to her and we end up going for a walk, and talking about our new homes, our new jobs, our new friends, and our new birds

She said she'd been going out with him now for about two and a half years, but they don't live together so he'd never find out. And you think about chasing her about school when you were wee and lying in your bed and listening to love songs and pretending they were about you. And the first time you asked her out she said no but one night you went to a wedding and when you came back to the pub she'd changed her mind and you went out. You remember the way she swung her arms when she held your hand but you can't remember how she kissed and now you've got the chance to find out

But you have to remember there's this other kiss and she's sittin' at home wondering where you are and what you're doing. And you worked hard on this kiss and you know it inside out; it's as much yours as it is hers, and it took a long time to get right, it took months of practice and months of embarrassment, but now you've got it perfected and you've been looking forward to that kiss all week
You can see her breath in the air between your faces, as you stand in the leaves and she just asks you straight out if you want to come and stay at her flat. But you make sure you get separate taxis and you go home and there might be a slight regret and maybe you'll wonder what you missed, but you have to remember the kiss that you worked so hard on.

Long ago in days of yore
It all began with a god named Thor
There were Vikings and boats
And some plans for a furniture store
It's not a bodega, it's not a mall
And they sell things for apartments smaller than mine
As if there were apartments smaller than mine

[Chorus]
Ikea: Just some oak and some pine and a handful of Norsemen
Ikea: Selling furniture for college kids and divorced men
Everyone has a home
But if you don't have a home you can buy one there

[Verse 2]
So rent a car or take the bus
Lay your cash down and put your trust
In the land where the furniture folds to a much smaller size
Billy the bookcase says hello
And so does a table whose name is Ingo
And the chair is a ladder-back birch but his friends call him Karl

On the first day of May I took to the road
I'd been staring out the window most of the morning
I'd watched the rain claw at the glass
And a vicious wind blew hard and fast
I should have taken it as a warning
As a warning
As a warning
As a warning
I'd given my nurse the weekend off
My meals were ill prepared
My typewriter had turned mute as a tomb
And my piano crouched in the corner of my room
With all its teeth bared
All its teeth bared
All its teeth bared
All its teeth bared

Hallelujah Hallelujah
Hallelujah Hallelujah

I left my house without my coat
Something my nurse would not have allowed
And I took the small roads out of town
And I passed a cow and the cow was brown
And my pyjamas clung to me like a shroud
Like a shroud
Like a shroud
Like a shroud
There rose before me a little house
With all hope and dreams kept within
A woman's voice close to my ear
Said, ""Why don't you come in here?""
""You looked soaked to the skin""
Soaked to the skin

Throw caution to the reckless wind
But with her hot cocoa and her medication
My nurse had been my one salvation
So I turned back home
I turned back home I turned back home

O.G. Original Gangster

[Verse 2]
When I wrote about parties, someone always died
When I tried to write happy, yo, I knew I lied
'Cause, I lived a life of crime Why play ya blind?
A simple look and anyone with two cents would know I'm
A hardcore player from the streets
Rapping bout hardcore topics over hardcore drum beats
A little different than the average though
Jet you through the fast lane, drop ya on death row
Cause anybody who's been there knows that
Life ain't so lovely on the blood-soaked fast track
That invincible shit don't work
Throw ya in a joint, you'll be coming out feet first
So I blast the mic with my style
Sometimes I'm ill and other times buckwild
But the science is always there
I'd be a true sucker if I acted like I didn't care
I rap for brothers just like myself
Dazed by the game in a quest for extreme wealth
But I kick it to you hard and real
One wrong move, and your cap's peeled
I ain't no super hero, I ain't no Marvel comic
But when it comes to game I'm atomic
At dropping it straight, point blank and untwisted
No imagination needed, cause I lived it
This ain't no fucking joke, this shit is real to me
I'm Ice-T, O.G

Two weeks ago I was out at the disco
Two brothers stepped up to me and said, ""Hey yo, Ice
We don't think you're down. What set ya claiming?""
E drew the Glock, yo my set's aiming!
Dumb motherfucker, try to roll on me, please!
I'm protected by a thousand emcees
And hoodlums and hustlers and bangers with jheri curls
We won't even count the girls
Cause they got my back and I got theirs too
Fight for the streets when I'm on Oprah or Donahue
They try to sweat a nigga but they just didn't figure
That my wit's as quick as a hair trigger

So step to me if you think that you're ready to
Got on your bullet proof? Well mine's going right thru

Without respect from streets, so I don't claim be
The hardest motherfucker on earth
Catch me slipping, I can't even get worked
But I don't slip that often, there's a coffin
Waiting for the brother who comes off soft when
The real fucking shit goes down, take a look around
All them pussies can be found
They talk a mean fight but fight like hoes
I'm from South Central, fool, where everything goes
Snatch you out your car so fast you'll get whiplash
Numbers on your rooftop for when the copters pass
Gangbangers don't carry no switchblades
Every kid's got a Tec 9 or a hand grenade
Thirty-seven killed last week in a crack war
Hostages tied up and shot in the liquor store
Nobody gives a fuck
""The children have to go to school!"" Well, moms, good luck!
Cause the shit's fucked up bad I use my pad and pen
And my lyrics break out mad
I try to write about fun and the good times
But the pen yanks away and explodes and destroys the rhyme
Maybe it's just cause of where I'm from

To tell it is a must
About an unsung hero
That moves away your dust

Some people make a fortune
Others earn a mint
My old man don't earn much
In fact he's flippin' skint

Oh, my old man's a dustman
He wears a dustman's hat
He wears cor-blimey trousers
And he lives in a council flat

He looks a proper nana
In his great big hobnail boots
He's got such a job to pull them up
That he calls 'em daisy roots

Some folks give tips at Christmas
And some of them forget
So when he picks their bins up
He spills some on the step

Now one old man got nasty
And to the council wrote
Next time my old man went 'round there
He punched him up the throat

Les: Well how do you do know he's a police dog?
Lonnie: He had a policeman with him

Though my old man's a dustman
He's got an 'eart of gold
He got married recently
Though he's eighty-six years old

We said ""'Ere, hang on, Dad
You're getting past your prime""
He said ""Well, when you get to my age
It helps to pass the time.""

Oi! My old man's a dustman
He wears a dustman's hat

Lonnie: I say, I say, I say!
Les: Huh?
Lonnie: My dustbin's full of lilies
Les: Well throw 'em away then!
Lonnie: I can't: Lily's wearing them

Now one day whilst in a hurry
He missed a lady's bin
He hadn't gone but a few yards
When she chased after him

""What game do you think you're playing?""
She cried right from the 'eart
""You've missed me, am I too late?""
""No, jump up on the cart!""

Oi! My old man's a dustman
He wears a dustman's hat
He wears cor-blimey trousers
And he lives in a council flat

Lonnie: I say, I say, I say!
Les: Not you again!
Lonnie: My dustbin's absolutely full with toadstools
Les: How do you know it's full?
Lonnie: 'Cause there's not mushroom inside
He found a tiger's head one day
Nailed to a piece of wood
The tiger looked like miserable
But I suppose he should

Just then from out a window
A voice began to wail
It said ""Oi! Where's me tiger's head?""
""Four foot from his tail.""

Oh my old man's a dustman
He wears a dustman's hat

Eres tanta gente, que dime con quién hablo ahora
¿No veis que no sois iguales?
¿Eres la de: ""quédate conmigo
Prometo darte tormento, darte malos ratos""?
Yo te prometo, si me escuchas niña, darte arte
Que no es lo mismo que ""Quédate y ya veremos""
""Quédate y ya veremos""
No es lo mismo ser que estar
No es lo mismo estar que quedarse, ¡qué va!
Tampoco quedarse es igual que parar, no es lo mismo
Será que ni somos, ni estamos, ni nos pensamos quedar
Pero es distinto conformarse o pelear
No es lo mismo, es distinto

No es lo mismo ""arte"" que hartar

Pero tenemos corazón que no es igual, lo sentimos, es distinto

We are the animals
Who have lost our hair
Retained some of our teeth
And gained a choice
We'll chase food, money and sex
Until satisfied
And when its time to rest
Ask ""what's next?""

When our instincts are egging us on

And when we think about it
We're like a masterpiece

We are the machines
Carrying our various genes
Then discarded

Or go to Bay Plaza and catch a flick
Wore my Timberland boots so I can stomp ticks
Scandalous get a whiff of this, miss
Just left the yard boys, now I'm blissed
I feel good per say good state of mind
Drive a red Sterling and the seats recline
I love it when a lady treats me kind
Go to Tavern on the Green and have a glass of wine

Under my heart three clouds of pain
She got the best of me
What was her destiny?
Maybe I should lick her with my nine millime...ter
My mind is in a blur
Cause you could never pay me to think this would occur
Me and this girl Jane Doe was living together
We were inseparable, noone could sever
At least that's what I thought
But later I fought with her substance
And almost ended up in Supreme Court
When I was on the road doing shows getting ends
She was in my Benz getting sniffy with her friends
And even when she crashed my whip I didn't flip
My man Slick Nick said Smooth you're starting to slip
Time went on I started noticing weight loss
Then I had to ask her was she riding the white horse
At first she said no, then she said yo Smooth I'm sorry
But I keep having visions of snow, I need blow
And I said whoa, little hottie
I'm not DeLorean, Gambino or Gotti
I don't deal coke, and furthermore you're making me broke
I'll put you in a rehab and I won't tell your folks
And what do you know
In 18 months she came home and I let her back in
And now she's sniffing again...

It's time to change our ways so we can save the day
For the children's sake and make a better place to play
And if it's all good, break out your coop and grip your wood
And if you're ridin' dirty, light your spliff and blow your—
But do it real big, exactly like a player should
Enjoy your 24, do your thing and rep your hood
The world is all yours, but still we all grind
Forever and a day, the choice you make is really all fine

I really believed
That God was listening to me

Raised the red flag high
Burnt the reichstag brown

Take a look up the railtrack

I spent the evening thinking about
All the blood that flowed away
Across the ocean to the second chance
I wonder how it got on when it reached the promised land?

Tried hard to imagine
The way you felt the day you sailed
From Wester Ross to Nova Scotia

We should have told you
But you know our sense of timing

And she whipped out a gun and tried to blow me away!

But you've no need to fear it
'Cause no one will hear it
'Cause sad songs and waltzes
Aren't selling this year

I'll tell all about how you cheated
I'd like for the whole world to hear
I'd like to get even with you
'Cause you're leaving
But sad songs and waltzes

It's a good thing that I'm not a star
You don't know how lucky you are
Though my record may say it
No one will play it

In the case of N.W.A versus the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube
And Eazy-motherfucking-E
Order, order, order!

Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth so help your black ass?

Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown
And not the other color, so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beating on and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me 'cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just 'cause I'm from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me, huh

And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath

Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm saying, ""Fuck you, punk!""
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'ma smoke 'em now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me

'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed

Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way?

Well, the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows

And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight

Là dove in pieno giorno
Risplendono le stelle

Quando attraverserà
L'ultimo vecchio ponte
Ai suicidi dirà
Baciandoli alla fronte
Venite in paradiso
Là dove vado anch'io
Perché non c'è l'inferno
Nel mondo del buon Dio

Fate che giunga a Voi

[Music Video - Intro]
Last October Grammy-nominated producer KANYE WEST was in a nearly fatal car accident. His jaw was fractured in nearly three places. Two weeks later he recorded this song with his mouth still wired shut... so the world could feel his pain!

[Intro]
Yo, G, they can't stop me from rappin', can they?
Can they, Hop?

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Post-Chorus]
I spit it through the wire, man
There's too much stuff on my heart right now, man
I'd gladly risk it all right now
It's a life-or-death situation, man
Y'all, y'all don't really understand how I feel right now, man

Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Tellin' her her son's on life support?
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been tryna be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwin' that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryna be lyin', I been tryna be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't tryna make a band
I swear, this, right here, history in the makin', man

[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

[Post-Chorus]
I really apologize for everything right now
If it's unclear at all, man
They got my mouth wired shut
For like… I dunno, the doctor said like six weeks
Y'know, he had, I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
I looked in the mirror
And half my jaw was in the back of my mouth, man
I couldn't believe it
But I'm still here for y'all right now, man
This what I got to say right here, dawg
Yeah, turn me up, yeah, uh
[Verse 2]
What if somebody from the Chi' that was ill got a deal
On the hottest rap label around?
But he wasn't talkin' 'bout coke and birds
It was more like spoken word, 'cept he's really puttin' it down?
And he explained the story 'bout how Blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, bad night, right place, wrong time
In the blink of a eye, his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt
You would know how Mase felt (Mason Betha!)
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God, driver two wanna sue
I got a lawyer for the case, to keep what's in my safe safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I…
I looked like Tom Cruise in Vanilla Sky, it was televised
There's been an accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael
I must got a angel, ‘cause look how death missed his ass
Unbreakable, what, you thought they'd call me Mr. Glass?
Look back on my life like the Ghost of Christmas Past
Toys ""R"" Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still won't grow up, I'm a grown-ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid **** that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire
[Chorus: Chaka Khan]
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you, I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire, even through the fire

When the doctor told me I had, um
That I was gonna have to have a plate in my chin

I thank You, Lord, for the love of my life and a friend
I made a promise and I'm lovin' my wife 'til the end
I thank You, Lord, for your guidance, 'cause it's all that counts
And right here, right now... Lord, this is Your house
I thank You, Lord, for a dream that came true to light
And I ask You to bless everybody in this room tonight
I don't always do the right thing and I ask You to forgive me
'Cause I need You here wit me, without You in my life it's empty
I think back how some people did me like, violence was the remedy
And because I think of that now, I pray for my enemy
Not because of what I'll do, but because they don't know
There's somethin' better after here, but everybody won't go
So I ask You to forgive them and we'll hope they see
And I thank You for the love that they've given to me
I will not abuse it nor will I lead them astray
You see I love 'em like children, that I see everyday
And I pray... no, we pray... together
Get us through the bad weather, and we love You forever
Let Your thought and my heart go hand in hand

And for as long as I can, as long as You permit me
Please give me the strength I need to live, bear with me

Figured out the plan, then I started to pray
And that prayer took me from here, over there
Back to over here, now it got me like where
Do I belong, do I fit in?
Things on my mind, where do I begin?
It's easier to sin, but it hurts my heart
I'm really tryna win, so where do we start?
""Thou shalt not steal."" But what if he stole from me?
""Thou shalt not kill."" But what if he's tryin' to kill me?
""Thou shalt not take my name in vain
No matter how hard it rains, withstand the pain""
[Chorus]
I'm ready to meet him
'Cause where I'm livin' ain't right, black hate white
White hate black, it's right back to the same fight
They got us suspectin' a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the Lord

[Verse 3]
Our Father, who art in Heaven
I'm not ashamed to ask for guidance at twenty-seven
No longer afraid to knock on Your door
Not scared anymore to lose my life in the war
After what I just saw, I'm ridin' with the Lord
'Cause I really can't afford to lose my head by the sword
And now that I've seen what I need to see
Please take me where I need to be
""What have you learned?"" It's better to tell the truth than to lie
""What have you learned?"" To love my life until I die
""What have you learned?"" Violence isn't always the key
""What have you learned?"" You can't always believe what you see
""What have you learned?"" It's better to forgive and forget
""What have you learned?"" Give as you expect to get
""What have you learned?"" That I can't go on without You
""What have you learned?"" I must've been a fool to ever doubt You

And the pale souls you have tasted
The sings of filthy passion
Will soon turn to cries of pain
When I claim what is mine
Through the justice of suffering

The night will end in tears
And the moment you dirt her skin with your fingers
You will be sentenced the same
Every second with her I count
And for every second you will suffer too

When the words of hope have all been spoken
And I wash the blood from my hands
And let them lie silent and cold on the flowers

And my anger is greater

With the hush of falling leaves
Casting shivering shadows
On the houses through the trees
And the light from a street lamp
Paints a pattern on my wall
Like the pieces of a puzzle
Or a child's uneven scrawl

In a narrow little room
As I lie upon my bed
In the early evening gloom
Impaled on my wall
My eyes can dimly see
The pattern of my life
And the puzzle that is me

[Verse 3]
From the moment of my birth
To the instant of my death
There are patterns I must follow
Just as I must breathe each breath
Like a rat in a maze

And the pattern never alters

'Cause you know, they know what’s up
So we started lookin' for the bitches with the big butts
Like her, but she keep cryin'
""I got a boyfriend"" — bitch, stop lyin'!
Dumb-ass hooker ain't nothin' but a dyke
Suddenly, I see some niggas that I don't like
Walked over to 'em, and said ""What's up?""
The first nigga that I saw — hit him in the jaw
Ren started stompin' him, and so did E
By that time, got rushed by security
Out the door, but we don't quit
Ren said ""Let's start some shit!""
I got a shotgun, and here's the plot:
Takin' niggas out with a flurry of buck shots
Boom! Boom! Boom! Yeah, I was gunnin'
And then you look, all you see is niggas runnin'
And fallin' and yellin' and pushin' and screamin' and cussin'

He got scared and hit the gas
Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rollin', I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to the fort
Sweatin' all the bitches in the biker shorts
We didn't get no play from the ladies
With six niggas in a car — are you crazy?
She was scared, and it was showin'
We all said ""Fuck you, bitch!"" and kept goin'
To the hood, and we was fin to
Find somethin' else to get into

And now, the wonderous world of..
Hey, come to Los Angeles!
Where you and your family can have peace and tranquility
Enjoy the refinement..
Hey Bone, hey nigga where you at though?
Hello, my name is Elaine
And I'll be your tour guide through South Central Los Angeles

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
How to survive in South Central (what you do?)
A place where bustin a cap is fundamental
No, you can't find the shit in a handbook
Take a close look, at a rap crook
Rule number one: get yourself a gun
A nine in your ass'll be fine
Keep it in your glove compartment
Cause jackers (yo) they love to start shit
Now if you're white you can trust the police
But if you're black they ain't nothin but beasts
Watch out for the kill
Don't make a false move and keep your hands on the steering wheel
And don't get smart
Answer all questions, and that's your first lesson
On stayin alive
In South Central, yeah, that's how you survive

Hi, this is Elaine again
Are you enjoying your stay in South Central Los Angeles?
Or has somebody taken your things?
Have you witnessed a driveby?
Okay, make sure you have your camcorder ready
To witness the extracurricular activities on blacks by the police
So you and your family can enjoy this tape, over and over again
This is Los Angeles, this is Los Angeles

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
Rule number two: don't trust nobody
Especially a bitch, with a hooker's body
Cause it ain't nuttin but a trap
And females'll get you jacked and kidnapped
You'll wind up dead
Just to be safe don't wear no blue or red
Cause most niggas get got
In either L.A., Compton or Watts
Pissed off black human beings
So I think you better skip the sight-seeing
And if you're nuttin but a mark
Make sure that you're in before dark
But if you need some affection, mate
Make sure the bitch ain't a Section 8
Cause if so that's a monkey-wrench ho
And you won't survive in South Central
[Break]
Now you realize it's not all that it's cracked up to be
You realize that it's fucked up!
It ain't nothin like the shit you saw on TV
Palm trees and blonde bitches?
I'd advise to you to pack your shit and get the fuck on, punk motherfucker!
And you'll get your ass straight smoked
Yo I wanna say whassup to DJ Chilly Chill, Sir Jinx
Aiy'yo Cube these motherfuckers don't know what time it is
So show these motherfuckers what's happenin'
Tell these motherfuckers, don't fuck around in South Central
God dammit!

[Verse 3: Ice Cube]
Rule number three: don't get caught up
Cause niggas are doing anything that's thought up
And they got a price
On everything from dope, to stolen merchandise
Weed to sherm
Cause South Central L.A., is one big germ
Waitin for a brother like you to catch a disease
And start slangin ki's
To an undercover or the wrong brother
And they'll smother, a out of town motherfucker
So don't take your life for granted
Cause it's the craziest place on the planet
In L.A., heroes don't fly through the sky of stars
They live behind bars
So everybody's doin' a little dirt
And it's the youngsters puttin' in the most work
So be alert and stay calm
As you enter, the concrete Vietnam
You say, the strong survive
Shit, the strong even die, in South Central
[Outro]
Yeah you bitches, you think I forgot about your ass you tramp-ass hoes?
You better watch out
And for you so called baller-ass niggas, you know what time it is
South Central ain't no joke
Got to keep your gat at all times motherfuckers
Better keep one in the chamber and nine in the clip god dammit
You'll sho' get got, just like that
This ain't no joke motherfuckers
Now I wanna send a shout-out to E-Dog, the engineer
Puttin' his two cents in

I went downstream
I followed the swans
Like i follow my dreams

Oh! i was living on borrowed time in a
Borrowed house for a borrowed crime
In need of help i came to your door
Saw the spike of the railings from
The 28/3rd floor
Singing
""build your castle, stop collecting stones
And the riverbed shall not be your home""

To the lighthouse my friend!
I bless your words and education
To the lighthouse my friend
Just go! just go!
To the lighthouse my friend
I am sorry that you came to find

""Great great minds
Against themselves conspire""

Now the bombs drop around our feet
Do we throw them back
Or bow and greet them
Everyone now, is so terrified
Of the glowing dark
And those orange skies

1415,ML1416,The Doors,Celebration of the Lizard,angry,"7 ContributorsCelebration Of The Lizard LyricsLions in the street and roaming
Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming
A beast caged in the heart of a city
The body of his mother
Rotting in the summer ground
He fled the town
He went down South and crossed the border
Left the chaos and disorder
Back there over his shoulder
One morning he awoke in a green hotel
With a strange creature groaning beside him
Sweat oozed from its shining skin
Is everybody in? Is everybody in?
Is everybody in?
The ceremony is about to begin
Wake up!
You can't remember where it was
Had this dream stopped?
The snake was pale gold, glazed and shrunken
We were afraid to touch it
The sheets were hot dead prisms
And she was beside me
Old, she's no, young
Her dark red hair, the white soft skin
Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom
Look! she's coming in here
I can't live through each slow century of her moving
I let my cheek slide down, the cool smooth tile
Feel the good cold stinging blood
The smooth hissing snakes of rain
Once I had a little game
I liked to crawl back in my brain
I think you know, the game I mean
I mean the game, called, 'Go insane'
You should try this little game
Just close your eyes forget your name
Forget the world, forget the people
And we'll erect, a different steeple
This little game is fun to do
Just close your eyes, no way to lose
And I'm right there, I'm going too
Release control, we're breaking through
Way back deep into the brain
Back where there's never any pain
And the rain falls gently on the town
And over the heads of all of us
And in the labyrinth of streams
Beneath, the quiet unearthly presence of
Gentle hill dwellers, in the gentle hills around
Reptiles abounding
Fossils, caves, cool air heights
Each house repeats a mold, windows rolled
Beast car locked in against morning
All now sleeping
Rugs silent, mirrors vacant
Dust Lying under the beds of lawful couples
Wound in sheets
And daughters, smug
With semen eyes in their nipples
Wait
There's been a slaughter here
Don't stop to speak or look around
Your gloves and fan are on the ground
We're getting out of town, we're going on the run
And you're the one I want to come
Not to touch the earth
Not to see the sun
Nothing left to do, but
Run, run, run
Let's run, let's run
House upon the hill, moon is lying still
Shadows of the trees
Witnessing the wild breeze
C'mon baby run with me
Let's run
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run
The mansion is warm at the top of the hill
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs
And you won't know a thing till you get inside
Dead President's corpse in the driver's car
The engine runs on glue and tar
C'mon along, we're not going very far
To the East to meet the Czar
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run
Some outlaws lived by the side of the lake
The minister's daughter's in love with the snake
Who lives in a well by the side of the road
Wake up, girl! We're almost home
We should see the gates by mornin'
We should be inside by evening
Sun, sun, sun
Burn, burn, burn
Burn, burn, burn
I will get you
Soon, soon, soon
I am the lizard king
I can do anything
We came down
The rivers and highways
We came down from
Forests and falls
We came down from
Carson and Springfield
We came down from
Phoenix enthralled
And I can tell you
The names of the Kingdom
I can tell you
The things that you know
Listening for a fistful of silence
Climbing valleys into the shade
For seven years, I dwelt
In the loose palace of exile
Playing strange games with the girls of the island
Now, I have come again
To the land of the fair and the strong and the wise
Brothers and sisters of the pale forest
Children of night
Who among you will run with the hunt?
Now night arrives with her purple legion
Retire now to your tents and to your dreams
Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth

I told it all step by step

How I landed on the island
And how I swim across the sea
And it crosses my mind
That I may awake to a knife in me
No more breath in my hair or ladies underwear
Tossed up over the alarm clock
Blood dripping from the bed to a neatly written poem
Heartfelt last line reading
There is no more mystery
Is it going to happen, my love?
There is no more mystery
Is it going to happen, my love?
""It's all in my head"", she said, ""Morning after nightmare""
""You're building a wall"", she said, ""Higher than the both of us

Show me a smile and I'll promise not to leave you""

And slept in a small bed

And we went on separately
I found your overseas souvenirs
Holiday greeting cards
Those long forgotten high school fears
""It's all in my head"", I said
Banging on the piano
I've not been so alone
I thought, since kicking in the womb
I drank so much tea
I wrote my letters in kanji
Around the block I walked and walked
Pretending you were with me

Not wanting to die out here
Without you

The hurting never ends
Like birthdays and old friends, we forget
That this flesh blood and bone is human
Trading phone lines for airlines
Unwilling to face
That love is found on the inside
Not the outside
And like a medicine bottle
In the cabinet, I'll keep you
And like a medicine bottle
In my hand I will hold you

And swallow you slowly
As to last me a lifetime
Without holding too tight
I do not want to lose

The thrill that it gives me
To look out from my window
And scowl at the houses
From my world in the bedroom
It's all in his head, she read
In a girlfriend's self-help book
It's all his own making
A war with himself
Like two sides of a wall
That separates two countries
He shuts out the world he once knew
To love you

It was so late but my mind was curious
It was quiet, snowing with frosted windows
I had a book but wasn't reading just watching you

Didn't want comforting
Just company, oh be sweet
It could go either way
Based on what they say

I didn't wish to be somewhere else

Sono l’uomo che ha provato la miseria
Sotto la sferza della sua ira
Egli mi ha guidato, mi ha fatto camminare
Nelle tenebre e non nella luce
Solo contro di me egli ha volto e rivolto
La sua mano tutto il giorno
Egli ha consumato la mia carne e la mia pelle
Ha rotto le mie ossa
Ha costruito sopra di me, mi ha circondato
Di veleno e di affanno
Mi ha fatto abitare in luoghi tenebrosi
Come i morti da lungo tempo
Anche se grido e invoco aiuto
Egli soffoca la mia preghiera
Ha sbarrato le mie vie con blocchi di pietra
Ha ostruito i miei sentieri
Egli era per me un orso in agguato
Un leone in luoghi nascosti
Seminando di spine la mia via, mi ha lacerato
Mi ha reso desolato
Ha teso l’arco, mi ha posto
Come bersaglio alle sue saette
Son diventato lo scherno di tutti i popoli
La loro canzone d’ogni giorno
Mi ha saziato con erbe amare
Mi ha dissetato con assenzio
Mi ha spezzato con la sabbia i denti
Mi ha steso nella polvere
Son rimasto lontano dalla pace
Ho dimenticato il benessere
E dico: “È sparita la mia gloria
La speranza che mi veniva dal Signore”
“È sparita la mia gloria
La speranza che mi veniva dal Signore”
“È sparita la mia gloria
La speranza che mi veniva dal Signore”
Sono la prova
Sono la salva
Sono la carne macellata

Sono la sanzione
Sono il sacrificio
Sono il Ragno Nero

Are you a teacher of the heart?
Yes, but not for thee

I met a man who lost his mind
In some lost place I had to find

But he walked behind

I could not walk at all

Whistles come from ashen shroud

Have you each and all gone blind:

That would be known as the end of creation
Would manifest itself

Back to one single event

The gap was ocean deep
Between us in the bed

The end of a love affair
The end of a life
The end of a love affair
Still we both survive

It didn't take so long
Really just a day
And all the hope was gone
It was clear I couldn't say

Getting up is easy
Beaten up, still easy
Cutting off is easy
Tearing down is easy

The end of a love affair

1528,ML1529,Opeth,The Baying of the Hounds,sad,"I hear the baying of the hounds in the distance
I hear them devouring
Pest-ridden jackals of the earth
Diabolical beasts and roaming the forests
In wait and constant protectors
Calling you to sit by his side
Your self-loathing image in his flesh
A revelation upon which you linger

His words are flies swarming towards the true insects
Feasting on buried dreams and spreading decay upon your skin
His eyes spew forth a darkness that cut through and paralyze
Casts light upon your secrets forced to confront your enemies

His mouth is a vortex sucking you into its pandemonium
Fools you with a helping hand of ashes reached out in false dismay
His body is a country, the cities lay dead beyond despair
Friends turned enemies unable to come clean
In a rising fog of reeking death

Everything you believed is a lie
Everyone you loved is a death-burden
So you take comfort in him and you are receptive to stark wishes

No longer struggling to declare your stand
You would inflict no harm to others
They are unaware and in a loop of futile events
You are everything, they are nothing

Drown in the deep mire with past desires

Lined up verses on dead skin
The tainted lips of a stranger resting upon hers

[Instrumental Break]

And I embrace bereavement
Everything beloved is shattered anyway
I would devote myself to anyone, I would accept any flaws

I am too weak to resist
Tension vibrating with horror, finding the outcast in my eyes
Pushing nerves on a puppet, endless poison in my veins
Clean intent now tainted with death

And so, cold touch now inhumane
Every waking hour awaiting a reverie to unfold
And now they are calling me
Louder by the minute
The baying of the hounds calling me back to my home1Embed"

1531,ML1532,My Dying Bride,The Light at the End of the World,sad,"An isle, a bright shining isle
Stands forever, alone in the sea
Of rock and of sand and grass
And shale, the isle bereft of trees

- Small. A speck in the wide blue
Sea. 'Tis the last of all the land
A dweller upon our lonesome
Isle, the last, lonely man? -

By the Gods he is there to
Never leave, to remain all his
Life. His punishment for
Evermore, to attend the
Eternal light

The lighthouse, tall and brilliant
White, which stands at the end
Of the world. Protecting ships
And sailors too, from rock they
Could be hurled

Yet nothing comes and nothing
Goes 'sept the bright blue sea
Which stretches near and far
Away, 't is all our man can see
You might also likeThough, one day, up high on
Rock, a bird did perch and cry
An albatross, he shot a glance
And wondered deeply, why?

Could it be a watcher sent?
A curse sent from the Gods
Who sits and cries and stares at him
The life that they have robbed

Each year it comes to watch
Over him, the creature from above
Not a curse but a reminder of
The woman that he loved

- Oh weary night, under stars
He'd lay and gaze
Up towards the moon and stars
The suns dying haze

Time and again, Orion's light
Filled our man with joy
Within the belt, he'd see his love
Remembering her voice -

The twinkle from the stars above
Bled peace into his heart
As long as she looks down on him
He knows they'll never part
One day good, one day bad
The madness, the heat, the sun
Out to sea, he spies upon land
His beloved Albion

Cliffs of white and trees of green
Children run and play
'My home land' he cries and weeps
Why so far away?

Eyes sore and red. Filled with tears
He runs towards the sea
To risk his life, a worthy cause
For home he would be

Into the sea, deep and blue
The waters wash him clean
Awake. He screams. Cold with sweat
And Albion a dream

- Such is life upon the isle
Of torment and woe
One day good. One day bad
And some days, even hope

The light at the end of the world
Burns bright for mile and mile
Yet tends the man, its golden glow
In misery all the while?
For fifty years he stands and waits
Atop the light, alone
Looking down upon his isle
The Gods have made his home -

The watcher at the end of the world
Through misery does defile
Remembers back to that single night
And allows a tiny smile

(His sacrifice was not so great
He insists upon the world
Again he would crime
Again he would pay
For one moment with the girl)

Her hair, long and black it shone
The dark, beauty of her eyes
Olive skin and warm embrace
Her memory never dies

'Twas years ago, he
Remembers clear
The life they once did live
Endless love and lust for life
They promised each would give

Alas, such love and laughter too
Was short as panting breath
For one dark night, her soul
Was kissed
By the shade of death

(Agony, like none before
Was suffered by our man.)
Who tends the light now
Burning bright
On the very last of land

(Anger raged and misery too
Like nothing ever before.)
He cursed the Gods and man
And life
And at his heart he tore

- A deity felt sympathy
And threw our man a light
'Your woman you may see again
For a single night. -

But think hard and well young man
There is a price to pay:
To tend the light at the end of
The world
Is where you must stay

Away from man and life and love
Alone you will be
On a tiny isle. A bright shining isle
In the middle of the sea.'

- 'I'll tend the light, for one more night
With the woman whom I love'
Screamed the man, with tearful eyes
To the deity above

And so it was that very night
His lover did return
To his arms and to their bed
Together they did turn

In deepest love and lust and passion
Entwined they did fall
Lost within each other's arms
They danced (in lover's ball). -

- Long was the night filled with love
For them the world was done
Awoke he did to brightest light
His woman and life had gone

To his feet he leapt. To the sea he looked
To the lighthouse on the stone
The price is paid and from now on
He lives forever alone

Fifty years have passed since then
And not a soul has he seen
But his woman lives with him still
In every single dream

'Tis sad to hear how young love has died
To know that, alone, someone has cried
But memories are ours to keep
To live them again, in our sleep.-Embed"

Man, I have been liftin’ all the supplements like I came from the gym
I know what I’ll do today, calculated, not a whim
If my diet never changes, face to face with Grim
But if my family never eatin’ then we live like Tiny Tim
Aren’t you a little too young? Who you to say that?
You doing in the rag, but cannot hide it, no wave cap
I’m on a fuckin’ rampage, but I turn back with a snap
You hear “grrt, grrt,” is that Perry or my gat?
You do not understand the fundamentals
I switch up my flow like the notes on portamentos
We gonna fizz and then we pop just like some Coke and Mentos
Nothing is gonna stop us, because our work is essential
My stash is being shaved and is lowered by the fuckin’ day
Was rolling in the green, but now the numbers in the gray
It’s not an issue, we gon’ go up, up, away

With longing and grace, God-given
Suffer her heart
And love her when your love goes unrequited

I must surely go
For my love calls me low to drag her from the depths of my soul
When will I see her, again?

The darkened claws, of death
The empty breath, desire

Restless in my speech

So vacant in my breach

Wie kann man so hart sein'n Flow auf den Takt bring'n?“
Man könnte meinen, ich bin krank, weil ich immer so hart rhym'
Wenn ich auf der Road mein'n Stuff spitt'
Na, aber irrelevant, ich nehm' mit fünfhundert Promille meinen Dick in die Hand
Und danach wird's intressant, denn alle Bitches im Land umzingeln mich dann und sagen: „Werd doch bitte mein Mann!“
Doch nein, Ladys, Mann, ich chille am Strand
Und spliffe 'nen Blunt und widme ihn dann Biggie und Pac
Denn ich bin rich und bekannt, ja, so wie Sisi und Franz
Egal, wo ich auch immer hingeh', alle blicken mich an
Ah, bin ein wichtiger Mann, ich habe Sinn und Verstand
Und geb' 'nen viel zu großen Fick auf dieses Business, verdammt!
Und komm mir bitte nicht an mit, du willst Feature, verdammt!
Ich kill' mit der Gun und danach bist du Pisser halt dran
Sorry, Digga, doch ich übertreibe kein bisschen
Alle Kiddies woll'n einfach sein so wie ich, denn
Ich kenn' wirklich keinen anderen sicken
Rapper, der die Lines mit 'ner Leichtigkeit bringt, man
So wie ich, Motherfucker!
Gib mir zehn Minuten Zeit, ich mach' 'nen Hit, Motherfucker!

And tore up the tracks again
In the winter of '65
We were hungry, just barely alive
By May the 10th, Richmond had fell
It's a time I remember, oh so well
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And the people were singing
They went, ""Na, na, la, na, na, la""
Back with my wife in Tennessee
When one day she called to me
""Virgil, quick, come see
There goes Robert E. Lee!""
Now, I don't mind chopping wood
And I don't care if the money's no good
You take what you need
And you leave the rest
But they should never
Have taken the very best

And the bells were ringing
The night they drove old Dixie down
And all the people were singing
They went, ""Na, na, la, na, na, la""
Like my father before me
I will work the land
And like my brother above me
Who took a rebel stand
He was just 18, proud and brave
But a Yankee laid him in his grave
I swear by the mud below my feet
You can't raise a Kane back up
When he's in defeat

Lest we fall to our knees

[Verse 1]
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck for respect
If it meant life or death, never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just wanna see if it's true
If it's you—what you say in your raps, what you do
So they feel it's part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real?
In confrontation, ain't no conversation, if you feel
You're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed
If you feel it, kill it; if you conceal it, reveal it
Being reasonable'll leave you full of bullets, pull it
Squeeze it 'til it's empty; tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze

Confounded all six senses

We pounded Rachel's radio
For reports about the bridge
There was nothing on but static
Nothing in the fridge
We lay there listening to the wind
Whistling through the pines
When we heard the engines idling
Saw the headlights through the blinds

When you feel like your flavour has gone the way
Of a pre-shelled pistachio
I know you're weighed down
And fed up with your heavy boots
Laced with melancholy notions all your own

I do — like sugar — tend toward the brittle and sticky when spun
And I know my demeanour can go the way
Of a photo left out in the sun
And I try to keep myself in lilies and flax seeds
Oh what a folly, fooling just yourself

Sit down and smoke away
I wouldn't knock it till you're in them shoes

As a blush it gives way to a bruise

To wake me up

Ain't never did nothing but try to kill your disease
At least help the symptoms, instead you infected me
I'm not the kind of man to draw a line in the sand
If you gotta draw at all then it's time for you to scram
P.S., you can keep all this shit
And hang around your broke friends and call yourself rich
The struggling I did with you was all for nothin'

For all them years, and I cheated on you never
Defended your honor, took in your mama
When she tried to rehab and had you back through the drama
You got a sick stone under your ribs
Where a heart is suppose to live
Sick, twisted and vindictive, with your windows dim

I suppose you were just stating your views
What was it all for?
For the weather or the battle of Agincourt

And the times that we all hoped would last
Like a train they have gone by so fast
And though we stood together
By the edge of the platform
We were not moved by them

With my own hands
When I make love to your memory
It's not the same
I miss the thunder
I miss the rain

And the fact that you don't understand
Casts a shadow over this land
But the sun still shines
From behind it

Thanks all the same
But I cannot bring myself to answer your letter
It's not your fault
But your honesty touches me like a fire

Will surely fade away
Like the love that we sopke of forever

And there I go jumping before the gunshot has gone off
Slap me with the splintered ruler
And it would knock me to the floor if I wasn't there already
If only I could hunt the hunter

And all I really want is some patience
A way to calm the angry voice
And all I really want is deliverance
Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah

[Verse 2]
Do I wear you out?
You must wonder why I'm relentless and all strung out
I'm consumed by the chill of solitary
I'm like Estella

Enough about me, let's talk about you for a minute
Enough about you, let's talk about life for a while
The conflicts, the craziness and the sound of pretenses falling
All around, all around

[Verse 3]
Why are you so petrified of silence?
Here, can you handle this?
Did you think about your bills, your ex, your deadlines
Or when you think you're gonna die?
Or did you long for the next distraction?

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I need now is intellectual intercourse
A soul to dig the hole much deeper
And I have no concept of time other than it is flying
If only I could kill the killer

And all I really want is some peace, man
A place to find a common ground
And all I really want is a wavelength
Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah
And all I really want is some comfort
A way to get my hands untied
And all I really want is some justice
Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah

There's a weight over me today
Something I have to say
Love you too much to leave
Don't like you enough to stay

My heads in a mess and I'm stressed
But I guess it's a test
In the quest for happiness
And the rest of that mess
So I best just acquiesce
Even though I've grown tired of you

And that ain't meant to sound spiteful
I just try to be insightful
When I write all my emotions
In the night all the stuff I try to fight
Will just come out and the sad fact is I'm so tired of you

Love, it's a weird thing ain't it?
There's no way to explain it
But I swear as well as pain
There should be joy but we sustain
The same level of mundane
And it's numbing me through
You might also likeI often wonder if I'd miss you
And have the urge to kiss you
If an issue was to hit through
To this heart that now feels disused
And said issue was too big to just ignore
And I walked out on you

The chances are I'd fall apart
And suffer seizures of the heart
As my chest begins to smart
The very second have to part
I want to go back to the start
But then again maybe I just feel new
Maybe I'd get my life on track
And start to focus my attack
On all the things my life just lacks
And start to claw my passion back
Instead of living like a hack
Half committed half relaxed
I'd have nothing to lose

Chorus (x2)

I guess lately I've had too much time to think
And yeah way too much drink
When paper meets the ink
Over-thinking is the chink in my armour
That's just what I do
And I've always been that way
Forever questioning each day
And every plea that's made
That maybe when I lay
My busy mind will make me prove
By finding problems and reasons
That might not even be true
See we got together so young
Before our real lives had begun
But flowers don't grow up as one
Each finds its own route to the sun
And that's exactly what we've done
We've grown up separately too
And for a few years now it's been the problem
And these realisations, I wish that I could stop them
But I've realised that love is all we have in common
And deep down you know that's true

But then surely that I'm still in love with you
Means there's something we can do
To get us through and to pursue
A brand new point of view
On how this gap grew, between me and you

So there's a weight over me and I'd hate to have to leave
But in fate I don't believe and the state of you and me
Isn't great as you can see
So I'll keep thinking this through

1636,ML1637,The Constructus Corporation,I'll See You Now Now,relaxed,"1 ContributorRipples in the Mesh - The Radioplay Lyrics[Documentary style commentator]

They have visited us from the dawn of time. And one can always read the signs. Their rebirth into our world is always coursed with famine, plague and death. Their latest manifestation, which seems to have been the most powerful, happened in the midst of 20th century depression in Central America. A child suffers from terrible nightmares. Nightmares that was so fiercely overwhelming that they became, aware of themselves.

And they could even experience our realm through a lucid state. They learn to manifest themselves.  And they studied, and watched, and schemed. Then grew and grew stronger and grew greater till they finally announced their arrival to the world AS! ...

…A highly successful multi-billionaire dollar soda pop industry.

And their overwhelming success was so magnificent, so unnervingly final, that they soon heaved more power and capital than any country worth mentioning. And they were eccentric, and they would paint the clouds and grow strange things and even scoop proud cities from the Earth, made to float and follow the golden sun!

The Constructus Corporation presents: the Ziggurat.

[Narrator]

The Ziggurat, a giant floating megalopolis of comfortable living, housed four autonomous societies and over a billion people. It was filled with more exciting personalities than a pomegranate is of pips! But for now, consider these two boys:

First: Randomboy -- A tight young MC and a natural leader, who in time would change the world for ever.

And secondly: his best friend, the Kidtronic.

Now, when studying Kidtronic it is vitally important to consider the following: him and his sister were orphans, and were raised by virtual parent personalities supplied by Constructus. Uhm, now. At the age of seven, he had re-written their program instructions and changed the parental shapes from loving moms and dads into two big fluffy bears that generally just acted silly and entertained his baby sister Anica.

At the age of 8 and a half, he was arrested by the Constructus assistants for the first time. His crime? He had hi-jacked two sprinter wet-wires servers and was using them to embezzle third-decimal credit to his sister's favorite virtual celebrities. It was the first in a series of five arrests.

Now, as you'd probably noticed, he was a complete genius
with all the tech- and cyber-reality. Kidtronic also designed games for devices called ""playgrounds,"" which covered your eyes and ears.
He was also paid annual tributes by all the banks in the Ziggurat for not bankrupting them.

Now c’mon! Let's see what he's up too. Oh! He's sleeping. Dreaming. Changing, into what he will soon become.


[Kidtronic dream]

ZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZz

Wait were am I? Breakfast table. Before school. A Mom and a dad. Anica. She's feeding us eggs. I don't wanna eat eggs. My dad's on the table. ARGH! He's cutting my hand. ARGHGHGG! My Brain! Uh uh uh uh uh!

[Narrator]

Almost at that precise moment, thirteen years before, in a secret hide-away 3 kilometers under the Himalayas, the CEO of Constructus International, a certain Mr. Kiriaku was in a meeting with the eyeless, prophet-witch named ""Next""

[Next in “” and Mr. Kiriaku in ( )]

“Ahhhhhhhhh”
(Tell me what you see?)
“Ah hahhafghghghha ! Lord. There will be danger ahg …”
(Danger ?)
“Ehh”
(What? What is its source?)
“Too much static uirghghg. Disturbance.”
(Speak, Next. What is the threat?)
“Lord it is fast. Thirteen years from this moment.”
(Thirteen years...Thirteen years!? What is its face? Where will it come from?)
“Lord, it seems to be invisible. All I can make out is... ripples. Ripples in the Mesh.”
(Well then find it Next!)
“I cannot, the pattern that the chaos weaves is too frantic, too - rand- AURGH”
“One will rise that will earn friends… The [?] time [?], and your blood [?]”

(Prophet enough! An invisible threat. Thirteen years from now. Capable of wiping Constructus off the face of the Earth? A mere random ripple in The Mesh that threatens me, a god! What created light, our light that cripples radiance! To be snuffed by a mere, random ripple in The Mesh?
Then I will create our champion. Hahaha. Our own hideous weapon. And send him up to dwell amongst the humans and seek and destroy the ripple-maker)

[Narrator]

And that very same day, two children were born on two different places on the Ziggurat. One, to loving family; and other to a multi-national corporation. But right now back to our story

Kidtronic had woken up and was loading his new game ""Long Street"" onto his playground. He wanted to show it to his friend Randomboy. He was hoping that they might get a chance to play it on the way to the emceeing competition. He was feeling a little nervous because him and Randomboy had both entered the competition. It was very prestigious, and the biggest of its kind yet. At the moment, he was concentrating on the show, doing some breathing exercises when his sister entered the room, without warning.

[Anica and Kidtronic]

“BOO!

“ARGH. Oh jeez, you scared the bejebus out of me. Don't do that.”

“So, where you going huh 'Tronic?”

“Nowhere.”

“Yes you are! You're going to that emceeing competition aren't you?”

“No I'm not.”

“Ohoh ! Please can I come with you, PLEeeeeease!?”
“No Anica, you're too young.”

“I'm not! Please, I won't bug you I swear, I sweaaaaar!”

“No”

“I promise, I won't even stand close to you guys”

“Anica stop, I said no and that's final. I'm leaving – Bye-bye”

“Oh he's such a stupid punk. I hate him! He never takes me, anywhere! But I love you Mr. Rockadopolis”

[Anica and Mr. Rockadopolis]

“Uhm, yeah. I love you too Anica. I whip that kid's ass.”

""No! You mustn't Mr Rockadopolis. They shouldn't know that you're real. I hate him. Did you know that he suffers from epilepileptic... ehhhpelepileptic ... E-E-EPILEPILEPTIC seizures?! No, you wouldn't. Only me and Randomboy knows that. He doesn't want anybody to know. When they happen, he makes himself disappear. And I especially hate it when he disappears. Ah, forget him! I`m going.""

[Narrator]

On the way to Randomboy house…

[In Kidtronic’s mind]

""He suffers from seizures"" [repeats many times,]
“I am inside of you”
“Jeez, what was that?”
“I feel fine”
“What is he becoming?”

[Narrator]
Randomboy opened his front door, and there stood Kidtronic, ridiculously punctual as usual.

[Kidtronic, Randomboy, Anica, Narrator]

“Yo, Randomboy,” said Kidtronic through his electronic telepathic interface.

“Yo”

“Check this out,” he continued, whilst downloading a game into Randomboy's playground. “I made this last night. It's called ‘Long Street’. I am the Ju-Ju man. You are Snufflegruff, which I still think is whack. You should make up your own-“

“Hey man, interrupted Random Boy, we've been through this already.”

“Yeah, well anyway, You must try and defeat me. Biter.”

“Boo!”

“Don't do that Anica!”

“Yo, Randomboy! What’s up? Hey!”

“Hey ‘sup Anica!”

“Go home.”

“No! I come with.”

“No, go home. Go play with your dolls.”

“I don't play with dolls!”

“Then what is this. Hahahah.”

“Mr Rockadopolis is not a doll! HE'S A MONSTER!”

“Don't be so mean. Give the doll back to her.”

“Hey look, Anica. we're gonna be performing so you can't hang with us. An’ there's gonna be too many people so, you can't go by yourself. But I know my grandma and some friends are going so...I mean, you can go with them.”

“I can look after myself.”

“No you can't.”

“They're old! And I want to hang with you guys.”

“No! No buts. We’re leaving. I'll see you later , Nics.”

[Anica raps]

“Those these guys think that I'm just some stupid little girl. I mean, Kidtronic wouldn't even let me play with the new game he made last night. Bong street or something. And now he won't even let me to come with! It's not fair! I take those punk dicks out any day at MC-ing
Yeah, watch me flipititititit...”

Some of the characters in my dreams have nightmares
Who took it upon themselves to trick me
Into believing they were real
Now I'm taking them out, one by one
Gorse monster play with prey just for fun, here we come!
Three strange meta-morphing hoodoos
'bout to rearrange, the realm of the nunus
Everybody dudus, undo the voodoo
Like Cookoo heh boo boo, good morning
You can’t fuck with the frequency
It’s squeaky clean, dream of me
Creeping sneakily through your dream machine
Anica the snuffling,
chuckling, bubbling, snuggling, tugging, bugging ... unplugging,
Ugly fluffy-toy duckling, hugging sucklings

I move in and out of bodies freely
Nobody can see me
Creepy-crawly heebie-jeebie
Getting all touchy-feely
La la la la la…

“What the hell is that? Something strange is going on? Get away.”
“I don't want you going in the woods again, yeah, I'm warning you.”

The people of Long Street lived very simple lives
They had wonderful natures, they were never impolite
Up until the day the Ju-ju man, came to town
now check it out, as I break-it-down.
Mrs. Lekkerlegs. Was busy hanging her washing on the line
So, what happened next was definitively like the last thing on her mind
An unfamiliar voice behind her said: ""How do you do?""
Erhm ""I'm very well thanks"" she replied ""but now, who are you?""
The strange character in a top hat and a long black coat
Introduced himself politely, and then said ""on that note I'd like to show you another something that I doubt you've ever seen
Take a look at this, beautiful machine
The strange little gadget started changing like magic
And cleverly made its way up to the clothes line
And in a blink of eye it removed the clothes, and span them around 'til they were dry
And they all folded very neatly, in no time
Eummh some Mrs. Lekkerlegs was quite taken back
Very curious about this mysterious character in black
Very soon the whole town was making the scene
About the Ju-ju man and his amazing machine
Something very, extra ordinary, is going to happen at the Long Street carnival
Don't wanna tell you “what gives you that impression, he's crazy”
Something very, extra-ordinary is going to happen at the Long Street carnival
“Wh-what you talkin' about?”

The next day the Ju-ju man went walking through town
Unaware of what everybody was talking about
He had some time to kill before his appointment a little later with the mayor.
So he took this opportunity to socialize a bit
And just between you and me the most surprising shit
It's about that spark, that strangest things have a habit of coming out the dark
But just when you expect them least umumu
Lies never rest in peace, anyway
Today was kind like, quite an important day
Oh everybody has come to see the Ju-ju man special present for the mayor
He greeted crowd with a bow that open, his big fat sack. And that tack.
Presented the mayor with a black backpack.
Everybody standing round went oohhh !
Mayor put it on, and I was like ""ummhh. What does it do?""
All of a sudden two long white arms with red button at the end, Extended at the end of the back-pack
Grab a ‘hold of them my friend.
The mayor follow this instruction and felt the power surge
As the special metal wings emerged
And everybody cried out with glee as The mayor took off clumsily, like a bumblebee
Something very, extra-ordinary is going to happen at the Long Street carnival
“Wh-what you talkin' about?”
“Keep an eye about that [?]”
“You know whatever, I'm trying to do my work. Shut up”
Something very, extra-ordinary is going to happen at the Long Street carnival
“Wh-what you talkin' about?”
“Hey, hey, I'm here. How many times am I.. C'mon. C'mon man. Have some consideration.”

Now meanwhile in the woods

Now Snufflegruff called an important meeting with a boom-band
Something's fun is going on, we better do something about it soon man
There's a humongous metal fungus spreading
and everyone's acting weird
I'm just trying to think of all this
We're the only ones who can see it
We've gotta do something to get everyone’s attention
and Hit them with our supernatural frequencies selections
We can build thing in the back of my Grandpa's Donkey-Kong.
And take a nice cruise through town with a fat beats bumping hard
But we can call it, ummh, oi, the Long Street carnival
Cause I know that Ju-ju man is definitely up to, something horrible
Ok, we got, quite a lot of stuff to do so, c'mon let’s get busy
The big fish is about to get taken out by some crazy little fishes

“Get ready, let's do this”
The big day arrived as advertised and everybody goes with the festive vibe
If the sun rose, the best the sky was shining extra bright.
Snuffing [?] his mind mesmerized these humans with his magnificent vibrations
Even some visitors from afar were like ""man, isn't this amazing""
The speakers bumped, as the boom-band freaked the funk
And all the smiling people feeling the song
Singing along, without a care in the world all shouting and clapping
All entirely unaware of what was about to happen.
Something very, extra-ordinary is going to happen at the Long Street carnival

“Oh listen old man, c'mon man you’re being a pain in the ass”
“Can you please just, for one second”
Something very, extra-ordinary is going to happen at the Long Street carnival
“Get out that, quick get out. I can't work with you here.”
“That [?] please leave. Gaurds!”
“Huh. Goodness Gracious”

The Boom-band blew beautifully that sunny afternoon
The day the machine stopped working was the day no one will forget it soon
A terrible,dreadful cry pierced through the Long Street carnival
As the Ju-ju man emerged from his brand new house on the hill
The crowd took on a new alien voice
As the Boom-band’s physical vibe revealed his true form
People screamed as the evil fiend morphed into some kind of park-town-prawn-like monster with and excruciatingly high-pitched screech like when you cook a lobster

But the boom-band just kept on playing
And the creature rose up into the air and started spraying
This disgusting yellow smelly stuff as it flew back to its master
With his tail between his legs and everyone lived happily ever after
The End.

[Assistant, Randomboy, Kidtronic]

“Come on guys! How many times am I gonna have to tell you. No play-grounding in the yellow zone""

“Thank goodness and assistant!”

“So it looks like I'm gonna have to... confiscate them, so uh.. do the right thing and hand them over.”

“No, you cannot remove my friend’s playground from his face!”

“Who's gonna stop me?”

“Well obviously not me. I mean, just look how big you are. You must work out? Isn't that right Kidtronic?”

“Oh Randomboy, I don't feel well”

“You cannot remove my friends playground face. You see, there was a random chi surge a while ago while we were playing a game and it seriously messed up Kidtronics power wire. I mean, just look at him. If you remove it now, you might do some serious damage to my friends’ eyes and ears. That is why I too am wearing my playground. Not just to look cool. No, but to rather let Kidtronic hack into my head, and well, soothe my sense to stop the pain. Oh man, the, ooh- the unbearable pain. Isn't that right, Kidtronic?”

“Ack- it's a seizure”

“No man, just look we really have to go now. You see, it’s to go see uh..”

“Snufflegr-“

“Yes! Dr. Snufflegruff. So if yous- would you be so kind as to handcuff yourself to that tree, just look over there- Yes, please. Okay. Okay, thank you very much. We're going now.”

[Narrator]

And off they went…

[Random Boy, Kidtronic]

Oh, phew. That was close. Good acting Kidtronic. Man- hey, yo, you can stop acting like that now, yo he's gone. Yo 'tronic, what the hell is going on? Do you hear me or something?”

“Get away from me… Random Boy! Ow!”

“Just Breathe”

“Open the door. Just do it. Stop it!”

“No, no, don't do that.”

“There is something inside me. Help me. Random- random ripples in the mesh.”

“Wha..Why?”

“Come closer Snufflegruff. Random Boy, get back.
Stay Random Boy. My name is Kai.”

“Kai, hmm.”

“I have lay dormant in the mind of Kidtronic for 13 years. He is a mere vessel.”

“Hmm.. oh”
“And he has fulfilled his task beautifully, to seek out the ripple maker.
To find him, attach himself to me who weaves the random chaos pattern
that could undo all that Constructus had done. And this final threat, this natural abomination, this ripple in the mesh...is you Random Boy.”

“Oh, far out.”

“See? We are the same. We were destined to collide. My very purpose was to meet you. For you see, random boy, you are life, and I am death, and this, is our beautiful union!”

“That sounds like a cool game. What's it called?”

“Die Random Boy! Die!”

“’Die. Random Boy. Die?’ Isn't that..?”

And the white pride don't like no side
And it's a riot if any one of us die
No parole or probation

1641,ML1642,The Cat Empire,The Rhythm,happy,"And for all of the sweet loving
That I have received
In the sun in the rain
By the moon by the sea
There is one time that I'm thinking of
One time where one woman
Did knock me off my feet
And my knees were shaking
And my jaw was dropping
And my eyes were squinting
And my smile was growing
And my pants were bulging
And my hands were sweating
And my chest was beating
So I cry
""Excuse me, what is the secret to your soul?""

Cause when you're walking along
When you're walking along

Your legs are a melody my hands
Would like to play
And your hips are a note
That does take me away
And your face and your eyes and your hair
And your waist and your smile
Drive me to distraction
She turned and she gave the evil eye
""Why thank you,"" she said
Then she sighed, ""Oh there's one thing
I think you failed to mention""
""What?"" I said then she said
""It's the rhythm you forgot""
And right then I knew what was what
And she snuck to my lips
And she kissed them
She said ""Young man
I'll show you some rhythm""

And since then
The rhythm's been running through my veins
In my thoughts in my eyes
In my head
It's insane
It's the thing that does drive me to scream
On the street when I think
Of some places it's taken me
I feel horny
When I'm thinking of some of that rhythm in my mind
What she gave, what she gives to me
All of the time
Say a little bit of sweet
Loving in your day
All my friends know it
Keeps the bad thoughts away
So sing with your hips my baby
When you're dancing to this tune
And when this tune is through
We'll sneak to some place and continue to

Tell me it's over, Rusbel awaits
I've been to the surface and nothing is there
Eyelids sank muffled in the nerve aura sound
But when she awakes, will she still be with us?

How did you get here? Ask all but the bait
From a Christ that went hissing, constrictin' his cells
We summon by candle, by book, and by bell

Slothful the child that preys on the seed
Shall behead the drought, wound under sleeves

Failure to comply as failure to decease
And still you won't know everything

The sulking drained the fall of my pale will swarming by your steps
Lickin' the ankles of your blasphemer guilts
It only meant to drape a plastic over the stuck pig scalp of head
To cover the sock where the flatline had spread
The kiosk in my temporal lobe is shaped like Rosalynn Carter
And she says my map is home again but torn face down
I have only but a million blemishes to tell you all about

Gas me the hind of your five-legged snare
Tooth picks the eye, but nothing's there
Down drags your waltz 'cross the altar top
From a sleep that deprivation knew
Trespass your form, I'm void of dusk
I'd ask to look, but the mask stays on
You'll levitate Teutonic print
Cruelty is the wrath of my instrument

In the end they just gagged me to make him come out

You locked the cuffs, arsenic erupts
Will you drink the shadow of my red hair?
You and your false witness to God
You've one in the chamber, but your finger got stuck
Let slip the sound of a cry for help
But all was lost on the night you walked
Palms speak through eyes, serve your memory lost
I contaminate with insignias

Unwrap my corpse and let it thaw
In the eye of the needle I can't get out
They'll check my wrist, I'll faint a pulse

If you roll the seven, St. Michael dies

Just up off the floor
We used to go down to grandma's house
Ev'ry month end or so

We'd have chicken pie and country ham
And homemade butter on the bread
But the best darn thing about Grandma's house
Was a great big feather bed

It was nine feet high and six feet wide
Soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick

It'd hold eight kids 'n' four hound dogs
And a piggy we stole from the shed
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
On grandma's feather bed

After supper we'd sit around the fire
The old folks'd spit and chew
Pa would talk about the farm and the war
And granny'd sing a ballad or two

I'd sit and listen and watch the fire
'Till the cobwebs filled my head
Next thing I'd know I'd wake up in the morning
In the middle of the old feather bed
You might also likeIt was nine feet high and six feet wide

And a piggy we stole from the shed
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
On grandma's feather bed

Well I love my ma, I love my pa
I love granny and grandpa too
I've been fishin' with my uncle, I wrestled with my cousin
I even kissed Aunt Lou, eww!
But if I ever had to make a choice
I guess it ought to be said
That I'd trade 'em all plus the gal down the road
For grandma's feather bed
I'd trade 'em all plus the gal down the road
(Well I guess... mumbling 'bout the gal down the road)

It was nine feet high and six feet wide
Soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick
It'd hold eight kids 'n' four hound dogs
And a piggy we stole from the shed

Don't call it a comeback, I been here for years

Making the tears rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the bass go boom
Explosions, overpowering
Over the competition, I'm towering
Wrecking shop when I drop
These lyrics that'll make you call the cops
Don't you dare stare, you better move
Don't ever compare
Me to the rest that'll all get sliced and diced
Competition's paying the price

The voice of racism preaching the gospel is devilish
A fake church called the prophet Muhammad a terrorist
Forgetting God is not religion, but a spiritual bond
And Jesus is the most quoted prophet in the Qu'ran
They bombed innocent people, tryna murder Saddam

This is the information that they hold back from Peter Jennings
'Cause Condoleeza Rice is just a new age Sally Hemings
I break it down with critical language and spiritual anguish
The Judas I hang with, the guilt of betraying Christ
You murdered him, stole his religion, and painted him white
Translated in psychologically tainted philosophy
Conservative political right-wing ideology
Glued together sloppily, the blasphemy of a nation
Got my back to the wall 'cause I'm facin' assassination
Guantanamo Bay, federal incarceration
How could this be the land of the free, home of the brave
Indigenous holocaust, and the home of the slaves?

Fightin' for freedom and fightin' terror, but what's reality?
Read about the history of the place that we live in
And stop letting corporate news tell lies to your children

[Verse 2]
Flow like the blood of Abraham through the Jews and the Arabs
Broken apart like a woman's heart, abused in a marriage
The brink of holy war, bottled up like a miscarriage
Embedded correspondents don't tell the source of the tension
And they refuse to even mention European intervention
Or the massacres in Jenin, the innocent screams
US-manufactured missiles and M16s
Weapon contracts and corrupted American dreams
Media censorship blockin’ out the video screens
A continent of oil kingdoms bought for a bargain
Democracy is just a word when the people are starvin'
The average citizen made to be blind to the reason
A desert full of genocide where the bodies are freezin'
And the world doesn't believe that you fightin' for freedom
'Cause you fucked the Middle East and gave birth to a demon
It's open season with the CIA buggin' my crib
Trapped in a ghetto region like a Palestinian kid
Where nobody gives a fuck whether you die or you live
I'm tryna give the truth and I know the price is my life
But when I'm gone they'll sing a song about Immortal Technique
Who beheaded the president and the princes and sheiks
You don't give a fuck about us, I can see through your facade
Like a fallen angel standing in the presence of God
Bitch niggas scared of the truth when it looks at you hard
[Chorus]
It's like MKUltra, controllin' your brain
Suggestive thinkin’, causin’ your perspective to change
They want to rearrange the whole point of view of the ghetto
The fourth branch of the government want us to settle
A bandanna full of glittering generality
Fightin' for freedom and fightin' terror, but what's reality?
Martial law is coming soon to the hood to kill you
While you hangin’ your flag out your project window

[Outro]
Yeah
The fourth branch of the government AKA the media
Seems to now have a retirement plan for ex-military officials
As if their opinion was at all unbiased
A machine shouldn't speak for men
So shut the fuck up, you mindless drone
And you know it's serious
When these same media outfits are spending millions of dollars on a PR campaign
To try to convince you they're fair and balanced
When they're some of the most ignorant and racist people
Giving that type of mentality a safe haven
We act like we share in the spoils of war that they do
We die in wars, we don't get the contracts to make money off 'em afterwards
We don't get weapons contracts, nigga
We don't get cheap labor for our companies, nigga
We are cheap labor, nigga

The smoke sank into my skin
So I came inside to be with you

We talked all night
About everything you could imagine
'Cause come the morning, I'll be gone

And as our eyes start to close
I turn to you and I let you know
That I love you

Well my dad was sick
My mom, she cared for him
Her loving nursed him back to life

And me, I ran
I couldn't even look at him
For fear I'd have to say goodbye

And as I start to leave
He grabs me by the shoulder and he tells me
""What's left to lose?
You've done enough
And if you fail, well then you fail, but not to us

So now here I sit
In a hotel off of Sunset
My thoughts bounce off Sam's guitar

And that's the way its been
Ever since we were kids, but now
Now, we've got something to prove

And I, I can see their eyes
But tell me something, can they see mine?
'Cause what's left to lose?
I've done enough
And if I fail, then I fail, but I gave it a shot

'Cause these last three years
I know they have been hard
But now it's time to get out of the desert and into the sun

Dog days of summer
Heat haze and bad temper
And whole days of shouting
""Would you listen to me?""
See, I'm the one in charge now
What happened to me?
I turned into someone's mother

[Chorus]
Really someone should give me a uniform
Or someone should show me where is the door
Or someone should come around and explain
How it is that love forgets to speak its name

[Verse 2]
And then you turn on the news
And it's somebody else's news
And it's always such bad news
And I'm no good with sad news anymore
Gets me running upstairs
To count heads in tangled beds

[Chorus]
And someone tears up that uniform
And somewhere gently closes a door
And I'm right here once more
Crying, confessing, counting my blessings
Don't let go

Of these castle walls
Lies a world I'm not a part of
Forbidden to even think for myself
Dared to step outside the line
For fear of torture

I always wanted to know
How to kill a king
Use his madness against him
Forsake everything
Though his grip is so tight
And it's choking me
I will find a way out
Of this loyalty

Just when I thought I was
Running out of time
The King stood trembling at my bedside
He said ""if you leave me now
My suicide will follow""
And I said ""what are you waiting for?""

Now I know
How to kill a king
Now he suffers in silence
With a poisonous sting
He could not steal my might
And it seems to be
I have found a way out
Of his loyalty

And wait in the arms of the cold cold ground

There's a ribbon in the willow, there's a tire-swing rope
There's a briar patch of berries takin' over the slope
The cat'll sleep in the mailbox and we'll never go to town
Till we bury every dream in the cold cold ground
In the cold cold ground

Give me a Winchester rifle and a whole box of shells
Blow the roof off the goat barn, let it roll down the hill

I find we'll lay down together in the cold cold ground

1705,ML1706,Björn Rosenström,Lurad,happy,"I går kväll ringde jag på en kontaktannons i tidningen
Idag så fick jag träffa henne som jag ringt till
Nyfiken på vad det var för gris i säck jag hade köpt
Ringde jag på dörren och så öppnade hon
Hon kom ifrån Arboga, jag synade henne noga
Och efter ordentligt övervägande jag sa:

Det stod att du var snygg
Men du är ful, jag har blivit lurad
Du skrev nåt om ett slott
Det här är ett skjul, jag har blivit lurad

Nu är det faktiskt så, sa hon, att jag tycker att jag är snygg
Så du kan inte stämma mig för lureri
Jag skiter väl i stämning, sa jag, men jag kräver att
Du ber om ursäkt och erkänner att du ser ut som stryk
Men jag fick inte ut ett jota, trots att jag hota
Med att rycka hår ur hennes snok

Det stod att du var snygg
Men du är ful, jag har blivit lurad
Du skrev nåt om ett slott
Det här är ett skjul, jag har blivit lurad

Nu satt jag uti klistret, ni förstår hur svårt jag hade
Jag kunde inte dra mig ur med äran i behåll
Jag var redan sur, men när jag fick dörren rätt i nyllet
Balla jag ur och börja gå bärsärkargång
Jag fick upp en sten och drog den genom hennes fönster
Sen tryckte jag in huvudet mitt så långt jag kunde och skrek:

That pines to fly south

Trusted to keep
The weight of oceans
From her rusted gates of sleep

A dreaming angel
Lying curled in the circles of Hell

Watch her back for any cracks to occur

She slips into the underworld

Deflowered by the powers

Has incensed, made me
A wanton felon
Searching for the key
To loose her harness
And set desires lurching free

Without her there

Thin walls would crumble
Horrors would corroborate from dogstar lair
But in her room at night
I care not for the underworld
Slathering and gathering emboldened Reichs
To breach, to teach
A dread thereafter
I would risk all this
For one minute of bliss

And eventually the sky did return
And I was there outside in green
And I watched the world being reborn 'til 1 AM
So I thought I'd let you know
It was beautiful, slow dancing to tunes of Billie Holiday
The city looked wonderful that way
And love, just like blood will always stain

And if I could reverse it
I don't think that it'd be worth it

1773,ML1774,The Arrogant Worms,Johnny Came Home Headless,happy,"1 ContributorLight in August (Chapter 13) LyricsWithin five minutes after the countrymen found the fire, the people began to gather. Some of them, also on the way to town in wagons to spend Saturday, also stopped. Some came afoot from the immediate neighborhood. This was a region of negro cabins and gutted and outworn fields out of which a corporal’s guard of detectives could not have combed ten people, man, woman or child, yet which now within thirty minutes produced, as though out of thin air, parties and groups ranging from single individuals to entire familiеs. Still others came out from town in racing and blatting cars. Among thesе came the sheriff of the county—a fat, comfortable man with a hard, canny head and a benevolent aspect—who thrust away those who crowded to look down at the body on the sheet with that static and childlike amaze with which adults contemplate their own inescapable portraits. Among them the casual Yankees and the poor whites and even the southerners who had lived for a while in the north, who believed aloud that it was an anonymous negro crime committed not by a negro but by Negro and who knew, believed, and hoped that she had been ravished too: at least once before her throat was cut and at least once afterward. The sheriff came up and looked himself once and then sent the body away, hiding the poor thing from the eyes.

Then there was nothing for them to look at except the place where the body had lain and the fire. And soon nobody could remember exactly where the sheet had rested, what earth it had covered, and so then there was only the fire to look at. So they looked at the fire, with that same dull and static amaze which they had brought down from the old fetid caves where knowing began, as though, like death, they had never seen fire before. Presently the fire truck came up gallantly, with noise, with whistles and bells. It was new, painted red, with gilt trim and a handpower siren and a bell gold in color and in tone serene, arrogant, and proud. About it hatless men and youths clung with the astonishing disregard of physical laws that flies possess. It had mechanical ladders that sprang to prodigious heights at the touch of a hand, like opera hats; only there was now nothing for them to spring to. It had neat and virgin coils of hose evocative of telephone trust advertisements in the popular magazines; but there was nothing to hook them to and nothing to flow through them. So the hatless men, who had deserted counters and desks, swung down, even including the one who ground the siren. They came too and were shown several different places where the sheet had lain, and some of them with pistols already in their pockets began to canvass about for someone to crucify.

But there wasn’t anybody. She had lived such a quiet life, attended so to her own affairs, that she bequeathed to the town in which she had been born and lived and died a foreigner, an out-lander, a kind of heritage of astonishment and outrage, for which, even though she had supplied them at last with an emotional barbecue, a Roman holiday almost, they would never forgive her and let her be dead in peace and quiet. Not that. Peace is not that often. So they moiled and clotted, believing that the flames, the blood, the body that had died three years ago and had just now begun to live again, cried out for vengeance, not believing that the rapt infury of the flames and the immobility of the body were both affirmations of an attained bourne beyond the hurt and harm of man. Not that. Because the other made nice believing. Better than the shelves and the counters filled with longfamiliar objects bought, not because the owner desired them or admired them, could take any pleasure in the owning of them, but in order to cajole or trick other men into buying them at a profit; and who must now and then contemplate both the objects which had not yet sold and the men who could buy them but had not yet done so, with anger and maybe outrage and maybe despair too. Better than the musty offices where the lawyers waited lurking among ghosts of old lusts and lies, or where the doctors waited with sharp knives and sharp drugs, telling man, believing that he should believe, without resorting to printed admonishments, that they labored for that end whose ultimate attainment would leave them with nothing whatever to do. And the women came too, the idle ones in bright and sometimes hurried garments, with secret and passionate and glittering looks and with secret frustrated breasts (who have ever loved death better than peace) to print with a myriad small hard heels to the constant murmur   Who did it? Who did it?   periods such as perhaps   Is he still free? Ah. Is he? Is he?

The sheriff also stared at the flames with exasperation and astonishment, since there was no scene to investigate. He was not yet thinking of himself as having been frustrated by a human agent. It was the fire. It seemed to him that the fire had been selfborn for that end and purpose. It seemed to him that that by and because of which he had had ancestors long enough to come himself to be, had allied itself with crime. So he continued to walk in a baffled and fretted manner about that heedless monument of the color of both hope and catastrophe until a deputy came up and told how he had discovered in a cabin beyond the house, traces of recent occupation. And immediately the countryman who had discovered the fire (he had not yet got to town; his wagon had not progressed one inch since he descended from it two hours ago, and he now moved among the people, wildhaired, gesticulant, with on his face a dulled, spent, glaring expression and his voice hoarsed almost to a whisper) remembered that he had seen a man in the house when he broke in the door.

“A white man?” the sheriff said.

“Yes, sir. Blumping around in the hall like he had just finished falling down the stairs. Tried to keep me from going upstairs at all. Told me how he had already been up there and it wasn’t nobody up there. And when I come back down, he was gone.”

The sheriff looked about at them. “Who lived in that cabin?”

“I didn’t know anybody did,” the deputy said. “Niggers, I reckon. She might have had niggers living in the house with her, from what I have heard. What I am surprised at is that it was this long before one of them done for her.”

“Get me a nigger,” the sheriff said. The deputy and two or three others got him a nigger. “Who’s been living in that cabin?” the sheriff said.

“I dont know, Mr Watt,” the negro said. “I aint never paid it no mind. I aint even knowed anybody lived in it.”

“Bring him on down here,” the sheriff said.

They were gathering now about the sheriff and the deputy and the negro, with avid eyes upon which the sheer prolongation of empty flames had begun to pall, with faces identical one with another. It was as if all their individual five senses had become one organ of looking, like an apotheosis, the words that flew among them wind- or air-engendered   Is that him? Is that the one that did it? Sheriff’s got him. Sheriff has already caught him   The sheriff looked at them. “Go away,” he said. “All of you. Go look at the fire. If I need any help, I can send for you. Go on away.” He turned and led his party down to the cabin. Behind him the repulsed ones stood in a clump and watched the three white men and the negro enter the cabin and close the door. Behind them in turn the dying fire roared, filling the air though not louder than the voices and much more unsourceless   By God, if that’s him, what are we doing, standing around here? Murdering a white woman the black son of a   None of them had ever entered the house. While she was alive they would not have allowed their wives to call on her. When they were younger, children (some of their fathers had done it too) they had called after her on the street, “Nigger lover! Nigger lover!”

In the cabin the sheriff sat down on one of the cots, heavily. He sighed: a tub of a man, with the complete and rocklike inertia of a tub. “Now, I want to know who lives in this cabin,” he said.
“I done told you I dont know,” the negro said. His voice was a little sullen, quite alert, covertly alert. He watched the sheriff. The other two white men were behind him, where he could not see them. He did not look back at them, not so much as a glance. He was watching the sheriff’s face as a man watches a mirror. Perhaps he saw it, as in a mirror, before it came. Perhaps he did not, since if change, flicker, there was in the sheriff’s face it was no more than a flicker. But the negro did not look back; there came only into his face when the strap fell across his back a wince, sudden, sharp, fleet, jerking up the corners of his mouth and exposing his momentary teeth like smiling. Then his face smoothed again, inscrutable.

“I reckon you aint tried hard enough to remember,” the sheriff said.

“I cant remember because I cant know,” the negro said. “I dont even live nowhere near here. You ought to know where I stay at, white folks.”

“Mr Buford says you live right down the road yonder,” the sheriff said.

“Lots of folks live down that road. Mr Buford ought to know where I stay at.”

“He’s lying,” the deputy said. His name was Buford. He was the one who wielded the strap, buckle end outward. He held it poised. He was watching the sheriff’s face. He looked like a spaniel waiting to be told to spring into the water.

“Maybe so; maybe not,” the sheriff said. He mused upon the negro. He was still, huge, inert, sagging the cot springs. “I think he just dont realise yet that I aint playing. Let alone them folks out there that aint got no jail to put him into if anything he wouldn’t like should come up. That wouldn’t bother to put him into a jail if they had one.” Perhaps there was a sign, a signal, in his eyes again; perhaps not. Perhaps the negro saw it; perhaps not. The strap fell again, the buckle raking across the negro’s back. “You remember yet?” the sheriff said.

“It’s two white men,” the negro said. His voice was cold, not sullen, not anything. “I dont know who they is nor what they does. It aint none of my business. I aint never seed them. I just heard talk about how two white men lived here. I didn’t care who they was. And that’s all I know. You can whup the blood outen me. But that’s all I know.”

Again the sheriff sighed. “That’ll do. I reckon that’s right.”

“It’s that fellow Christmas, that used to work at the mill, and another fellow named Brown,” the third man said. “You could have picked out any man in Jefferson that his breath smelled right and he could have told you that much.”

“I reckon that’s right, too,” the sheriff said.

He returned to town. When the crowd realised that the sheriff was departing, a general exodus began. It was as if there was nothing left to look at now. The body had gone, and now the sheriff was going. It was as though he carried within him, somewhere within that inert and sighing mass of flesh, the secret itself: that which moved and evoked them as with a promise of something beyond the sluttishness of stuffed entrails and monotonous days. So there was nothing left to look at now but the fire; they had now been watching it for three hours. They were now used to it, accustomed to it; now it had become a permanent part of their lives as well as of their experiences, standing beneath its windless column of smoke taller than and impregnable as a monument which could be returned to at any time. So when the caravan reached town it had something of that arrogant decorum of a procession behind a catafalque, the sheriff’s car in the lead, the other cars honking and blatting behind in the sheriff’s and their own compounded dust. It was held up momentarily at a street intersection near the square by a country wagon which had stopped to let a passenger descend. Looking out, the sheriff saw a young woman climbing slowly and carefully down from the wagon, with that careful awkwardness of advanced pregnancy. Then the wagon pulled aside; the caravan went on, crossing the square, where already the cashier of the bank had taken from the vault the envelope which the dead woman had deposited with him and which bore the inscription   To be opened at my death. Joanna Burden   The cashier was waiting at the sheriff’s office when the sheriff came in, with the envelope and its contents. This was a single sheet of paper on which was written, by the same hand which inscribed the envelope   Notify E. E. Peebles, Attorney, —— Beale St., Memphis, Tenn., and Nathaniel Burrington, —— St. Exeter, N. H.   That was all.

“This Peebles is a nigger lawyer,” the cashier said.
“Is that so?” the sheriff said.

“Yes. What do you want me to do?”

“I reckon you better do what the paper says,” the sheriff said. “I reckon maybe I better do it myself.” He sent two wires. He received the Memphis reply in thirty minutes. The other came two hours later; within ten minutes afterward the word had gone through the town that Miss Burden’s nephew in New Hampshire offered a thousand dollars’ reward for the capture of her murderer. At nine o’clock that evening the man whom the countryman had found in the burning house when he broke in the front door, appeared. They did not know then that he was the man. He did not tell them so. All they knew was that a man who had resided for a short time in the town and whom they knew as a bootlegger named Brown, and not much of a bootlegger at that, appeared on the square in a state of excitement, seeking the sheriff. Then it began to piece together. The sheriff knew that Brown was associated somehow with another man, another stranger named Christmas about whom, despite the fact that he had lived in Jefferson for three years, even less was known than about Brown; it was only now that the sheriff learned that Christmas had been living in the cabin behind Miss Burden’s house for three years. Brown wanted to talk; he insisted on talking, loud, urgent; it appeared at once that what he was doing was claiming the thousand dollars’ reward.

“You want to turn state’s evidence?” the sheriff asked him.

“I dont want to turn nothing,” Brown said, harsh, hoarse, a little wild in the face. “I know who done it and when I get my reward, I’ll tell.”

“You catch the fellow that done it, and you’ll get the reward,” the sheriff said. So they took Brown to the jail for safekeeping. “Only I reckon it aint no actual need of that,” the sheriff said. “I reckon as long as that thousand dollars is where he can smell it, you couldn’t run him away from here.” When Brown was taken away, still hoarse, still gesticulant and outraged, the sheriff telephoned to a neighboring town, where there was a pair of bloodhounds. The dogs would arrive on the early morning train.

About the bleak platform, in the sad dawn of that Sunday morning, thirty or forty men were waiting when the train came in, the lighted windows fleeing and jarring to a momentary stop. It was a fast train and it did not always stop at Jefferson. It halted only long enough to disgorge the two dogs: a thousand costly tons of intricate and curious metal glaring and crashing up and into an almost shocking silence filled with the puny sounds of men, to vomit two gaunt and cringing phantoms whose droopeared and mild faces gazed with sad abjectness about at the weary, pale faces of men who had not slept very much since night before last, ringing them about with something terrible and eager and impotent. It was as if the very initial outrage of the murder carried in its wake and made of all subsequent actions something monstrous and paradoxical and wrong, in themselves against both reason and nature.

It was just sunrise when the posse reached the cabin behind the charred and now cold embers of the house. The dogs, either gaining courage from the light and warmth of the sun or catching the strained and tense excitement from the men, began to surge and yap about the cabin. Snuffing loudly and as one beast they took a course, dragging the man who held the leashes. They ran side by side for a hundred yards, where they stopped and began to dig furiously into the earth and exposed a pit where someone had buried recently emptied food tins. They dragged the dogs away by main strength. They dragged them some distance from the cabin and made another cast. For a short time the dogs moiled, whimpering, then they set off again, full-tongued, drooling, and dragged and carried the running and cursing men at top speed back to the cabin, where, feet planted and with backflung heads and backrolled eyeballs, they bayed the empty doorway with the passionate abandon of two baritones singing Italian opera. The men took the dogs back to town, in cars, and fed them. When they crossed the square the church bells were ringing, slow and peaceful, and along the streets the decorous people moved sedately beneath parasols, carrying Bibles and prayerbooks.

That night a youth, a countryboy, and his father came in to see the sheriff. The boy told of having been on the way home in a car late Friday night, and of a man who stopped him a mile or two beyond the scene of the murder, with a pistol. The boy believed that he was about to be robbed and even killed, and he told how he was about to trick the man into permitting him to drive right up into his own front yard, where he intended to stop the car and spring out and shout for help, but that the man suspected something and forced him to stop the car and let him out. The father wanted to know how much of the thousand dollars would become theirs.

“You catch him and we’ll see,” the sheriff said. So they waked the dogs and put them into another car and the youth showed them where the man had got out, and they cast the dogs, who charged immediately into the woods and with their apparent infallibility for metal in any form, found the old pistol with its two loaded chambers almost at once.

“It’s one of them old Civil War, cap-and-ball pistols,” the deputy said. “One of the caps has been snapped, but it never went off. What do you reckon he was doing with that?”

“Turn them dogs loose,” the sheriff said. “Maybe them leashes worry them.” They did so. The dogs were free now; thirty minutes later they were lost. Not the men lost the dogs; the dogs lost the men. They were just across a small creek and a ridge, and the men could hear them plainly. They were not baying now, with pride and assurance and perhaps pleasure. The sound which they now made was a longdrawn and hopeless wailing, while steadily the men shouted at them. But apparently the animals could not hear either. Both voices were distinguishable, yet the belllike and abject wailing seemed to come from a single throat, as though the two beasts crouched flank to flank. After a while the men found them so, crouched in a ditch. By that time their voices sounded almost like the voices of children. The men squatted there until it was light enough to find their way back to the cars. Then it was Monday morning.

The temperature began to rise Monday. On Tuesday, the night, the darkness after the hot day, is close, still, oppressive; as soon as Byron enters the house he feels the corners of his nostrils whiten and tauten with the thick smell of the stale, mankept house. And when Hightower approaches, the smell of plump unwashed flesh and unfresh clothing—that odor of unfastidious sedentation, of static overflesh not often enough bathed—is wellnigh overpowering. Entering, Byron thinks as he has thought before: ‘That is his right. It may not be my way, but it is his way and his right.’ And he remembers how once he had seemed to find the answer, as though by inspiration, divination: ‘It is the odor of goodness. Of course it would smell bad to us that are bad and sinful.’
They sit again opposite one another in the study, the desk, the lighted lamp, between. Byron sits again on the hard chair, his face lowered, still. His voice is sober, stubborn: the voice of a man saying something which will be not only unpleasing, but will not be believed. “I am going to find another place for her. A place where it will be more private. Where she can . . .”

Hightower watches his lowered face. “Why must she move? When she is comfortable there, with a woman at hand if she should need one?” Byron does not answer. He sits motionless, downlooking; his face is stubborn, still; looking at it, Hightower thinks, ‘It is because so much happens. Too much happens. That’s it. Man performs, engenders, so much more than he can or should have to bear. That’s how he finds that he can bear anything. That’s it. That’s what is so terrible. That he can bear anything, anything.’ He watches Byron. “Is Mrs Beard the only reason why she is going to move?”

Still Byron does not look up, speaking in that still, stubborn voice: “She needs a place where it will be kind of home to her. She aint got a whole lot more time, and in a boarding house, where it’s mostly just men . . . A room where it will be quiet when her time comes, and not every durn horsetrader or courtjury that passes through the hallway . . .”

“I see,” Hightower says. He watches Byron’s face. “And you want me to take her in here.” Byron makes to speak, but the other goes on: his tone too is cold, level: “It wont do, Byron. If there were another woman here, living in the house. It’s a shame too, with all the room here, the quiet. I’m thinking of her, you see. Not myself. I would not care what was said, thought.”

“I am not asking that.” Byron does not look up. He can feel the other watching him. He thinks   He knows that is not what I meant, too. He knows. He just said that. I know what he is thinking. I reckon I expected it. I reckon it is not any reason for him to think different from other folks, even about me   “I reckon you ought to know that.” Perhaps he does know it. But Byron does not look up to see. He talks on, in that dull, flat voice, downlooking, while beyond the desk Hightower, sitting a little more than erect, looks at the thin, weatherhardened, laborpurged face of the man opposite him. “I aint going to get you mixed up in it when it aint none of your trouble. You haven’t even seen her, and I dont reckon you ever will. I reckon likely you have never seen him to know it either. It’s just that I thought maybe . . .” His voice ceases. Across the desk the unbending minister looks at him, waiting, not offering to help him. “When it’s a matter of not-do, I reckon a man can trust himself for advice. But when it comes to a matter of doing, I reckon a fellow had better listen to all the advice he can get. But I aint going to mix you up in it. I dont want you to worry about that.”

“I think I know that,” Hightower says. He watches the other’s downlooking face. ‘I am not in life anymore,’ he thinks. ‘That’s why there is no use in even trying to meddle, interfere. He could hear me no more than that man and that woman (ay, and that child) would hear or heed me if I tried to come back into life.’ “But you told me she knows that he is here.”

“Yes,” Byron says, brooding. “Out there where I thought the chance to harm ere a man or woman or child could not have found me. And she hadn’t hardly got there before I had to go and blab the whole thing.”

“I dont mean that. You didn’t know yourself, then. I mean, the rest of it. About him and the—that . . . It has been three days. She must know, whether you told her or not. She must have heard by now.”

“Christmas.” Byron does not look up. “I never said any more, after she asked about that little white scar by his mouth. All the time we were coming to town that evening I was afraid she would ask. I would try to think up things to talk to her about so she would not have a chance to ask me any more. And all the time I thought I was keeping her from finding out that he had not only run off and left her in trouble, he had changed his name to keep her from finding him, and that now when she found him at last, what she had found was a bootlegger, she already knew it. Already knew that he was a nogood.” He says now, with a kind of musing astonishment: “I never even had any need to keep it from her, to lie it smooth. It was like she knew beforehand what I would say, that I was going to lie to her. Like she had already thought of that herself, and that she already didn’t believe it before I even said it, and that was all right too. But the part of her that knew the truth, that I could not have fooled anyway . . .” He fumbles, gropes, the unbending man beyond the desk watching him, not offering to help. “It’s like she was in two parts, and one of them knows that he is a scoundrel. But the other part believes that when a man and a woman are going to have a child, that the Lord will see that they are all together when the right time comes. Like it was God that looks after women, to protect them from men. And if the Lord dont see fit to let them two parts meet and kind of compare, then I aint going to do it either.”

“Nonsense,” Hightower says. He looks across the desk at the other’s still, stubborn, ascetic face: the face of a hermit who has lived for a long time in an empty place where sand blows. “The thing, the only thing, for her to do is to go back to Alabama. To her people.”

“I reckon not,” Byron says. He says it immediately, with immediate finality, as if he has been waiting all the while for this to be said. “She wont need to do that. I reckon she wont need to do that.” But he does not look up. He can feel the other looking at him.

“Does Bu—Brown know that she is in Jefferson?”

For an instant Byron almost smiles. His lip lifts: a thin movement almost a shadow, without mirth. “He’s been too busy. After that thousand dollars. It’s right funny to watch him. Like a man that cant play a tune, blowing a horn right loud, hoping that in a minute it will begin to make music. Being drug across the square on a handcuff every twelve or fifteen hours, when likely they couldn’t run him away if they was to sick them bloodhounds on him. He spent Saturday night in jail, still talking about how they were trying to beat him out of his thousand dollars by trying to make out that he helped Christmas do the killing, until at last Buck Conner went up to his cell and told him he would put a gag in his mouth if he didn’t shut up and let the other prisoners sleep. And he shut up, and Sunday night they went out with the dogs and he raised so much racket that they had to take him out of jail and let him go too. But the dogs never got started. And him hollering and cussing the dogs and wanting to beat them because they never struck a trail, telling everybody again how it was him that reported Christmas first and that all he wanted was fair justice, until the sheriff took him aside and talked to him. They didn’t know what the sheriff said to him. Maybe he threatened to lock him back up in jail and not let him go with them next time. Anyway, he calmed down some, and they went on. They never got back to town until late Monday night. He was still quiet. Maybe he was wore out. He hadn’t slept none in some time, and they said how he was trying to outrun the dogs so that the sheriff finally threatened to handcuff him to a deputy to keep him back so the dogs could smell something beside him. He needed a shave already when they locked him up Saturday night, and he needed one bad by now. I reckon he must have looked more like a murderer than even Christmas. And he was cussing Christmas now, like Christmas had done hid out just for meanness, to spite him and keep him from getting that thousand dollars. And they brought him back to jail and locked him up that night. And this morning they went and took him out again and they all went off with the dogs, on a new scent. Folks said they could hear him hollering and talking until they were clean out of town.”

“And she doesn’t know that, you say. You say you have kept that from her. You had rather that she knew him to be a scoundrel than a fool: is that it?”

Byron’s face is still again, not smiling now; it is quite sober. “I dont know. It was last Sunday night, after I came out to talk to you and went back home. I thought she would be asleep in bed, but she was still sitting up in the parlor, and she said, ‘What is it? What has happened here?’ And I didn’t look at her and I could feel her looking at me. I told her it was a nigger killed a white woman. I didn’t lie then. I reckon I was so glad I never had to lie then. Because before I thought, I had done said ‘and set the house afire.’ And then it was too late. I had pointed out the smoke, and I had told her about the two fellows named Brown and Christmas that lived out there. And I could feel her watching me the same as I can you now, and she said, ‘What was the nigger’s name?’ It’s like God sees that they find out what they need to know out of men’s lying, without needing to ask. And that they dont find out what they dont need to know, without even knowing they have not found it out. And so I dont know for sure what she knows and what she dont know. Except that I have kept it from her that it was the man she is hunting for that told on the murderer and that he is in jail now except when he is out running with dogs the man that took him up and befriended him. I have kept that from her.”

“And what are you going to do now? Where does she want to move?”

“She wants to go out there and wait for him. I told her that he is away on business for the sheriff. So I didn’t lie altogether. She had already asked me where he lived and I had already told her. And she said that was the place where she belonged until he came back, because that is his house. She said that’s what he would want her to do. And I couldn’t tell her different, that that cabin is the last place in the world he would want her to ever see. She wanted to go out there as soon as I got home from the mill this evening. She had her bundle all tied up and her bonnet on, waiting for me to get home. ‘I started once to go on by myself,’ she said. ‘But I wasn’t sho I knowed the way.’ And I said ‘Yes; only it was too late today and we would go out there tomorrow, and she said, ‘It’s a hour till dark yet. It aint but two miles, is it?’ and I said to let’s wait because I would have to ask first, and she said, ‘Ask who? Aint it Lucas’s house?’ and I could feel her watching me and she said, ‘I thought you said that that was where Lucas lived,’ and she was watching me and she said, ‘Who is this preacher you keep on going to talk to about me?’ ”

“And you are going to let her go out there to live?”

“It might be best. She would be private out there, and she would be away from all the talking until this business is over.”

“You mean, she has got her mind set on it, and you wont stop her. You dont want to stop her.”

Byron does not look up. “In a way, it is his house. The nighest thing to a home of his own he will ever own, I reckon. And he is her . . .”

“Out there alone, with a child coming. The nearest house a few negro cabins a half mile away.” He watches Byron’s face.

“I have thought of that. There are ways, things that can be done . . .”

“What things? What can you do to protect her out there?”

Byron does not answer at once; he does not look up. When he speaks his voice is dogged. “There are secret things a man can do without being evil, Reverend. No matter how they might look to folks.”

“I dont think that you could do anything that would be very evil, Byron, no matter how it looked to folks. But are you going to undertake to say just how far evil extends into the appearance of evil? just where between doing and appearing evil stops?”

“No,” Byron says. Then he moves slightly; he speaks as if he too were waking: “I hope not. I reckon I am trying to do the right thing by my lights.”—‘And that,’ Hightower thinks, ‘is the first lie he ever told me. Ever told anyone, man or woman, perhaps including himself.’ He looks across the desk at the stubborn, dogged, sober face that has not yet looked at him. ‘Or maybe it is not lie yet because he does not know himself that it is so.’ He says:

“Well.” He speaks now with a kind of spurious brusqueness which, flabbyjowled and darkcaverneyed, his face belies. “That is settled, then. You’ll take her out there, to his house, and you’ll see that she is comfortable and you’ll see that she is not disturbed until this is over. And then you’ll tell that man—Bunch, Brown—that she is here.”

“And he’ll run,” Byron says. He does not look up, yet through him there seems to go a wave of exultation, of triumph, before he can curb and hide it, when it is too late to try. For the moment he does not attempt to curb it; backthrust too in his hard chair, looking for the first time at the minister, with a face confident and bold and suffused. The other meets his gaze steadily.

“Is that what you want him to do?” Hightower says. They sit so in the lamplight. Through the open window comes the hot, myriad silence of the breathless night. “Think what you are doing. You are attempting to come between man and wife.”

Byron has caught himself. His face is no longer triumphant. But he looks steadily at the older man. Perhaps he tried to catch his voice too. But he cannot yet. “They aint man and wife yet,” he says.

“Does she think that? Do you believe that she will say that?” They look at one another. “Ah, Byron, Byron. What are a few mumbled words before God, before the steadfastness of a woman’s nature? Before that child?”

“Well, he may not run. If he gets that reward, that money. Like enough he will be drunk enough on a thousand dollars to do anything, even marry.”

“Ah, Byron, Byron.”

“Then what do you think we—I ought to do? What do you advise?”

“Go away. Leave Jefferson.” They look at one another. “No,” Hightower says. “You dont need my help. You are already being helped by someone stronger than I am.”

For a moment Byron does not speak. They look at one another, steadily. “Helped by who?”

“By the devil,” Hightower says.

‘And the devil is looking after him, too,’ Hightower thinks. He is in midstride, halfway home, his laden small market basket on his arm. ‘Him, too. Him, too,’ he thinks, walking. It is hot. He is in his shirt sleeves, tall, with thin blackclad legs and spare, gaunt arms and shoulders, and with that flabby and obese stomach like some monstrous pregnancy. The shirt is white, but it is not fresh; his collar is soiled, as is the white lawn cravat carelessly knotted, and he has not shaved for two or three days. His panama hat is soiled, and beneath it, between hat and skull against the heat, the edge and corners of a soiled handkerchief protrude. He has been to town to do his semiweekly marketing, where, gaunt, misshapen, with his gray stubble and his dark spectacleblurred eyes and his blackrimmed hands and the rank manodor of his sedentary and unwashed flesh, he entered the one odorous and cluttered store which he patronised and paid with cash for what he bought.

“Well, they found that nigger’s trail at last,” the proprietor said.

“Negro?” Hightower said. He became utterly still, in the act of putting into his pocket the change from his purchases.

“That bah—fellow; the murderer. I said all the time that he wasn’t right. Wasn’t a white man. That there was something funny about him. But you cant tell folks nothing until—”

“Found him?” Hightower said.

“You durn right they did. Why, the fool never even had sense enough to get out of the county. Here the sheriff has been telephoning all over the country for him, and the black son—uh was right here under his durn nose all the time.”

“And they have . . .” He leaned forward against the counter, above his laden basket. He could feel the counter edge against his stomach. It felt solid, stable enough; it was more like the earth itself were rocking faintly, preparing to move. Then it seemed to move, like something released slowly and without haste, in an augmenting swoop, and cleverly, since the eye was tricked into believing that the dingy shelves ranked with flyspecked tins, and the merchant himself behind the counter, had not moved; outraging, tricking sense. And he thinking, ‘I wont! I wont! I have bought immunity. I have paid. I have paid.’

“They aint caught him yet,” the proprietor said. “But they will. The sheriff taken the dogs out to the church before daylight this morning. They aint six hours behind him. To think that the durn fool never had no better sense . . . show he is a nigger, even if nothing else. . . .” Then the proprietor was saying, “Was that all today?”

“What?” Hightower said. “What?”

“Was that all you wanted?”

“Yes. Yes. That was . . .” He began to fumble in his pocket, the proprietor watching him. His hand came forth, still fumbling. It blundered upon the counter, shedding coins. The proprietor stopped two or three of them as they were about to roll off the counter.

“What’s this for?” the proprietor said.

“For the . . .” Hightower’s hand fumbled at the laden basket. “For—”

“You already paid.” The proprietor was watching him, curious. “That’s your change here, that I just gave you. For the dollar bill.”

“Oh,” Hightower said. “Yes. I . . . I just—” The merchant was gathering up the coins. He handed them back. When the customer’s hand touched his it felt like ice.

“It’s this hot weather,” the proprietor said. “It does wear a man out. Do you want to set down a spell before you start home?” But Hightower apparently did not hear him. He was moving now, toward the door, while the merchant watched him. He passed through the door and into the street, the basket on his arm, walking stiffly and carefully, like a man on ice. It was hot; heat quivered up from the asphalt, giving to the familiar buildings about the square a nimbus quality, a quality of living and palpitant chiaroscuro. Someone spoke to him in passing; he did not even know it. He went on, thinking   And him too. And him too   walking fast now, so that when he turned the corner at last and entered that dead and empty little street where his dead and empty small house waited, he was almost panting. ‘It’s the heat,’ the top of his mind was saying to him, reiterant, explanatory. But still, even in the quiet street where scarce anyone ever paused now to look at, remember, the sign, and his house, his sanctuary, already in sight, it goes on beneath the top of his mind that would cozen and soothe him: ‘I wont. I wont. I have bought immunity.’ It is like words spoken aloud now: reiterative, patient, justificative: ‘I paid for it. I didn’t quibble about the price. No man can say that. I just wanted peace; I paid them their price without quibbling.’ The street shimmers and swims; he has been sweating, but now even the air of noon feels cool upon him. Then sweat, heat, mirage, all, rushes fused into a finality which abrogates all logic and justification and obliterates it like fire would: I will not! I will not!

When, sitting in the study window in the first dark, he saw Byron pass into and then out of the street lamp, he sat suddenly forward in his chair. It was not that he was surprised to see Byron there, at that hour. At first, when he first recognised the figure, he thought   Ah. I had an idea he would come tonight. It is not in him to support even the semblance of evil   It was while he was thinking that that he started, sat forward: for an instant after recognising the approaching figure in the full glare of the light he believed that he was mistaken, knowing all the while that he could not be, that it could be no one except Byron, since he was already turning into the gate.

Tonight Byron is completely changed. It shows in his walk, his carriage; leaning forward Hightower says to himself   As though he has learned pride, or defiance   Byron’s head is erect, he walks fast and erect; suddenly Hightower says, almost aloud: ‘He has done something. He has taken a step.’ He makes a clicking sound with his tongue, leaning in the dark window, watching the figure pass swiftly from sight beyond the window and in the direction of the porch, the entrance, and where in the next moment Hightower hears his feet and then his knock. ‘And he didn’t offer to tell me,’ he thinks. ‘I would have listened, let him think aloud to me.’ He is already crossing the room, pausing at the desk to turn on the light. He goes to the front door.

“It’s me, Reverend,” Byron says.

“I recognised you,” Hightower says. “Even though you didn’t stumble on the bottom step this time. You have entered this house on Sunday night, but until tonight you have never entered it without stumbling on the bottom step, Byron.” This was the note upon which Byron’s calls usually opened: this faintly overbearing note of levity and warmth to put the other at his ease, and on the part of the caller that slow and countrybred diffidence which is courtesy. Sometimes it would seem to Hightower that he would actually hale Byron into the house by a judicious application of pure breath, as though Byron wore a sail.

But this time Byron is already entering, before Hightower has finished his sentence. He enters immediately, with that new air born somewhere between assurance and defiance. “And I reckon you are going to find that you hate it worse when I dont stumble than when I do,” Byron says.

“Is that a hope, or is it a threat, Byron?”

“Well, I dont mean it to be a threat,” Byron says.

“Ah,” Hightower says. “In other words, you can offer no hope. Well, I am forewarned, at least. I was forewarned as soon as I saw you in the street light. But at least you are going to tell me about it. What you have already done, even if you didn’t see fit to talk about it beforehand.” They are moving toward the study door. Byron stops; he looks back and up at the taller face.

“Then you know,” he says. “You have already heard.” Then, though his head has not moved, he is no longer looking at the other. “Well,” he says. He says: “Well, any man has got a free tongue. Woman too. But I would like to know who told you. Not that I am ashamed. Not that I aimed to keep it from you. I come to tell you myself, when I could.”

They stand just without the door to the lighted room. Hightower sees now that Byron’s arms are laden with bundles, parcels that look like they might contain groceries. “What?” Hightower says. “What have you come to tell me?—But come in. Maybe I do know what it is already. But I want to see your face when you tell me. I forewarn you too, Byron.” They enter the lighted room. The bundles are groceries: he has bought and carried too many like them himself not to know. “Sit down,” he says.

“No,” Byron says. “I aint going to stay that long.” He stands, sober, contained, with that air compassionate still, but decisive without being assured, confident without being assertive: that air of a man about to do something which someone dear to him will not understand and approve, yet which he himself knows to be right just as he knows that the friend will never see it so. He says: “You aint going to like it. But there aint anything else to do. I wish you could see it so. But I reckon you cant. And I reckon that’s all there is to it.”

Across the desk, seated again, Hightower watches him gravely. “What have you done, Byron?”

Byron speaks in that new voice: that voice brief, terse, each word definite of meaning, not fumbling. “I took her out there this evening. I had already fixed up the cabin, cleaned it good. She is settled now. She wanted it so. It was the nearest thing to a home he ever had and ever will have, so I reckon she is entitled to use it, especially as the owner aint using it now. Being detained elsewhere, you might say. I know you aint going to like it. You can name lots of reasons, good ones. You’ll say it aint his cabin to give to her. All right. Maybe it aint. But it aint any living man or woman in this country or state to say she cant use it. You’ll say that in her shape she ought to have a woman with her. All right. There is a nigger woman, one old enough to be sensible, that dont live over two hundred yards away. She can call to her without getting up from the chair or the bed. You’ll say, but that aint a white woman. And I’ll ask you what will she be getting from the white women in Jefferson about the time that baby is due, when here she aint been in Jefferson but a week and already she cant talk to a woman ten minutes before that woman knows she aint married yet, and as long as that durn scoundrel stays above ground where she can hear of him now and then, she aint going to be married. How much help will she be getting from the white ladies about that time? They’ll see that she has a bed to lay on and walls to hide her from the street all right. I dont mean that. And I reckon a man would be justified in saying she dont deserve no more than that, being as it wasn’t behind no walls that she got in the shape she is in. But that baby never done the choosing. And even if it had, I be durn if any poor little tyke, having to face what it will have to face in this world, deserves—deserves more than—better than— But I reckon you know what I mean. I reckon you can even say it.” Beyond the desk Hightower watches him while he talks in that level, restrained tone, not once at a loss for words until he came to something still too new and nebulous for him to more than feel. “And for the third reason. A white woman out there alone. You aint going to like that. You will like that least of all.”

“Ah, Byron, Byron.”

Byron’s voice is now dogged. Yet he holds his head up still. “I aint in the house with her. I got a tent. It aint close, neither. Just where I can hear her at need. And I fixed a bolt on the door. Any of them can come out, at any time, and see me in the tent.”

“Ah, Byron, Byron.”

“I know you aint thinking what most of them think. Are thinking. I know you would know better, even if she wasn’t—if it wasn’t for—I know you said that because of what you know that the others will think.”

Hightower sits again in the attitude of the eastern idol, between his parallel arms on the armrests of the chair. “Go away, Byron. Go away. Now. At once. Leave this place forever, this terrible place, this terrible, terrible place. I can read you. You will tell me that you have just learned love; I will tell you that you have just learned hope. That’s all; hope. The object does not matter, not to the hope, not even to you. There is but one end to this, to the road that you are taking: sin or marriage. And you would refuse the sin. That’s it, God forgive me. It will, must be, marriage or nothing with you. And you will insist that it be marriage. You will convince her; perhaps you already have, if she but knew it, would admit it: else, why is she content to stay here and yet make no effort to see the man whom she has come to find? I cannot say to you, Choose the sin, because you would not only hate me: you would carry that hatred straight to her. So I say, Go away. Now. At once. Turn your face now, and dont look back. But not this, Byron.”

They look at one another. “I knew you would not like it,” Byron says. “I reckon I done right not to make myself a guest by sitting down. But I did not expect this. That you too would turn against a woman wronged and betrayed—”

“No woman who has a child is ever betrayed; the husband of a mother, whether he be the father or not, is already a cuckold. Give yourself at least the one chance in ten, Byron. If you must marry, there are single women, girls, virgins. It’s not fair that you should sacrifice yourself to a woman who has chosen once and now wishes to renege that choice. It’s not right. It’s not just. God didn’t intend it so when He made marriage. Made it? Women made marriage.”

“Sacrifice? Me the sacrifice? It seems to me the sacrifice—”

“Not to her. For the Lena Groves there are always two men in the world and their number is legion: Lucas Burches and Byron Bunches. But no Lena, no woman, deserves more than one of them. No woman. There have been good women who were martyrs to brutes, in their cups and such. But what woman, good or bad, has ever suffered from any brute as men have suffered from good women? Tell me that, Byron.”

They speak quietly, without heat, giving pause to weigh one another’s words, as two men already impregnable each in his own conviction will. “I reckon you are right,” Byron says. “Anyway, it aint for me to say that you are wrong. And I dont reckon it’s for you to say that I am wrong, even if I am.”

“No,” Hightower says.

“Even if I am,” Byron says. “So I reckon I’ll say good night.” He says, quietly: “It’s a good long walk out there.”

“Yes,” Hightower says. “I used to walk it myself, now and then. It must be about three miles.”

“Two miles,” Byron says. “Well.” He turns. Hightower does not move. Byron shifts the parcels which he has not put down. “I’ll say good night,” he says, moving toward the door. “I reckon I’ll see you, sometime soon.”

“Yes,” Hightower says. “Is there anything I can do? Anything you need? bedclothes and such?”

“I’m obliged. I reckon she has a plenty. There was some already there. I’m obliged.”

“And you will let me know? If anything comes up. If the child— Have you arranged for a doctor?”

“I’ll get that attended to.”

“But have you seen one yet? Have you engaged one?”

“I aim to see to all that. And I’ll let you know.”

Then he is gone. From the window again Hightower watches him pass and go on up the street, toward the edge of town and his two-mile walk, carrying his paperwrapped packages of food. He passed from sight walking erect and at a good gait; such a gait as an old man already gone to flesh and short wind, an old man who has already spent too much time sitting down, could not have kept up with. And Hightower leans there in the window, in the August heat, oblivious of the odor in which he lives—that smell of people who no longer live in life: that odor of overplump desiccation and stale linen as though a precursor of the tomb—listening to the feet which he seems to hear still long after he knows that he cannot, thinking, ‘God bless him. God help him’; thinking   To be young. To be young. There is nothing else like it: there is nothing else in the world   He is thinking quietly: ‘I should not have got out of the habit of prayer.’ Then he hears the feet no longer. He hears now only the myriad and interminable insects, leaning in the window, breathing the hot still rich maculate smell of the earth, thinking of how when he was young, a youth, he had loved darkness, of walking or sitting alone among trees at night. Then the ground, the bark of trees, became actual, savage, filled with, evocative of, strange and baleful half delights and half terrors. He was afraid of it. He feared; he loved in being afraid. Then one day while at the seminary he realised that he was no longer afraid. It was as though a door had shut somewhere. He was no longer afraid of darkness. He just hated it; he would flee from it, to walls, to artificial light. ‘Yes,’ he thinks. ‘I should never have let myself get out of the habit of prayer.’ He turns from the window. One wall of the study is lined with books. He pauses before them, seeking, until he finds the one which he wants. It is Tennyson. It is dogeared. He has had it ever since the seminary. He sits beneath the lamp and opens it. It does not take long. Soon the fine galloping language, the gutless swooning full of sapless trees and dehydrated lusts begins to swim smooth and swift and peaceful. It is better than praying without having to bother to think aloud. It is like listening in a cathedral to a eunuch chanting in a language which he does not even need to not understand.Embed"
1774,ML1775,Ice T,New Jack Hustler,angry,"[Verse 1]
Hustler, word, I pull the trigger long
Grit my teeth, spray till every nigga's gone
Got my block sewn, armored dope spots
Last thing I sweat's a sucka punk cop

Move like a king when I roll, hops
You try to flex, bang, another nigga drops
You gotta deal with this 'cause there's no way out
Why? Cash money ain't never gonna play out

I got nothin to lose, much to gain
In my brain, I got a capitalist migraine
I gotta get paid tonight, you muthafuckin' right
Pickin' my grip, check my bitch, keep my game tight

So many hoes on my jock, think I'm a movie star
Nineteen, I got a $50,000 dollar car
Go to school, I ain't goin for it
Kiss my ass, bust the cap on the Moet

Why? I'd rather be a New Jack Hustler

Here I come, so you better break north
As I stride, my gold chains glide back and forth
I care nothin' 'bout you, and that's evident
All I love's my dope and dead presidents

Sound crazy? Well, it isn't
The ends justify the means, that's the system
I learned that in school then I dropped out
Hit the streets, checked a grip, and now I got clout

I had nothing, and I wanted it
You had everything and you flaunted it
Turned the needy into the greedy
With cocaine, my success came speedy
Got me twisted, jammed into a paradox
Every dollar I get, another brother drops
Maybe that's the plan and I don't understand
God damn, you got me sinkin in quicksand

But since I don't know, and I ain't never learned
I gotta get paid, I got money to earn
With my posse, out on the ave
Bump my sounds, crack a forty and laugh

Cool out and watch my new Benz gleam
Is this a nightmare? Or the American dream?
So think twice if you're coming down my block
You wanna journey through hell? Well, shit gets hot

Pregnant teens, children's screams
Life is weighed on the scales of a triple beam

You don't come here much and ya better not
Wrong move (bang), ambulance cot
I gotta get more money than you got
So what, some motherfucker gets shot?

That's how the game is played, another brother slayed
The wound is deep, but they're givin us a band aid
My education's low but I got long dough
I'm raised like a pit bull, my heart pumps nitro
Sleep on silk, lie like a politician
My Uzi's my best friend, cold as a mortician
Lock me up, it's genocidal catastrophe
There'll be another one after me, a hustler

Talked about life, God, death, and your family
Didn't want any promises
Just my undivided honesty

A fraction of who I once believed

1793,ML1794,American Music Club,The Confidential Agent,sad,"[Verse 1]
Take the velvet line for comfort
High above the water, feel disconnected and free
Tired of hopes that I just can't run from
I travel in secret, I know they're pursuing me
Morning that falls represents a weak link
After is after night's work is done
There's no sun, just a grey horizon
Hiding from heaven another frozen world

[Chorus]
Watch the ship hold to its course
As an act of devotion
And me, I'm lost at sea
Going through the motions

[Verse 2]
Gave all my passion to the ocean
She holds it for me in reserve
My word is gone into remission
Your love's a tragedy that I don't deserve
She said, ""You're only growing now.""
She said, ""Soon have we begun, then she can have you
But until then, you're mine
Until then, you're mine.""

I watch her hold to her course
As an act of devotion
And me, I'm riding high
Going through

An act of devotion
And me I'm lost in her hands

I stumbled on this photograph, it kind of made me laugh
It took me way back, back down memory lane
I see the happiness, I see the pain
Where am I? Back down memory lane
I see us standing there, such a happy, happy pair
Love beyond compare, look a-there, look a-there

[Hook]
The way you held me
No one could tell me
That love would die

[Verse 2]
Why did I have to find this photograph? I thought I had forgot the past
Now I'm slipping fast, back down memory lane
I feel the happiness, I feel the pain
Here am I, back down memory lane
I'm in the sunshine, I'm in the rain
I thought it was over, here I go again

[Hook]

[Bridge/Verse 3]
I don't wanna go
Travel up and down
Faster that the speed of sound
Back down memory lane
You steal my foolish heart
Don't let this feeling start

1803,ML1804,David Holmes,Gritty Shaker,happy,"I'm sittin' at a coffee table, unable to see straight
Watchin' parallel lines unwind and undulate
Behind the rain-streaked windowpane, the scene's bleak
Another train leavin' home
Conceding defeat with a low moan

Hangin' in a sky, made of stone
Everybody's leavin' home, I called my man Jerome
To come meet me in the twilight zone
Leave your mobile phone at home and come alone

I bought him coffee and a snack
Settled back, started speakin'
He was tweakin' with the peak of his cap
While I'm seekin' to discover what it takes to stay sober
Not cover my mistakes
Try to maybe make sense of the evidence
It's over, she's gone for good
Why should I lie, singin' a killer's lullaby
Identified by the dying ring of her goodbye
The last thing you hear before your life disappear

Now it just gets worse, like my stomach will burst
Feel like I've been cursed
With seven centuries of bitter memories
And inadequacies, previous he's and she's
I'm movin' round this old house for the last time
Scene of my past crimes, been here for lifetimes
Hearin' the chimes of the old clock that used to mock
You might also likeYou got eternity for takin' stock
This place is like a padlock
You look shocked
Trust me, nothing ever moves but the dust
There's just us and I'm here to torment and tease
And that's how it was for centuries
Me and my memories, till you brought the keys

Took the couple of Saturdays
I moved in runnin' from tragedies and boozing
Seven hundred years since I came here
You appear, same hair, same quizzical stare
I couldn't get near
And the sheer frustration was more than I could bear
I was really cursed, thought I'd been through the worst part

That was just the first part, just the start
Every night I'd be sitting with dread, breaking my heart
In case the man she'd been chasin' gets to first base
And I just can't escape, I'm in bad shape
You making love to someone else is more than I can take
And so I make all the movement I can to no avail
Scream and yell, sinkin' deeper into my personal Hell

I'm getting heated, I'm sorry, have another coffee
I needed to release my sparrow chest
From just a piece of this pressure
Unless an escape route is found
I'm going down underground
Into lifetimes of pain, it's absurd
The heaviest chain is contained is the sound of one word
So I'm referred back to Hell, huh
Just as well, I hate needles an' get twinges
At the thought of syringes
J, I'm going insane with shame
I dream and watch her makin' love over and over again
With what I call a farmer's swain
Unintelligent, pea-brained retard who's dick is always hard
Oh God, of course I'm jealous, fellows
Oversexed flexing his pec's
Jesus, what's he going make her do next?
I'm mad vex, the way she gently scratches his chest

You used to do that to me back in 1253
Pity me, while you lie with your lover
I stare and suffer in despair while you ruffle his hair
Unaware of who else is there
I move quick, I want to try my trick one last time
You know it's possible to vaguely define my outline
When dust move in the sunshine
So I'm tryin' to change, vibrate myself to near human pitch

Which reminds me how I used to come unstitched
And switch 'round the house in a blind rage
It took years and an ocean of tears
To find the key to this cage
And write another stage into a new age
It's difficult to gauge
But I know that I'll see you again, on that you may depend
I just don't know how or when
Sleep on, my lost love on goneEmbed"

When I give up

How cold is the flame

How cold is the sun

The coming sky so white
And I'm the dark of this our new day

Still harder getting up, getting dressed, living with this regret

I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart

Added to the shopping carts of all hard-working families

When restlessness attacks, seemingly at random?

Something between woozy and confusion

Of your automated new spouse and then dripping
Possibly leading to the unpredicted stimulation of its artificial emotion circuits

Yes, young black teenagers are reported to be the oldest, and the newest, creatures added to the endangered species list. As of now, no efforts have been made to preserve the Blacks. When asked why, a top law official adds, 'Because they make good game hunting'""

All I hear is motherfuckers rappin' succotash
Livin' large, tellin' me to get out the gang
I'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigga
How the fuck do you figure
That I can say ""Peace"" and the gunshots will cease?
Every cop killing goes ignored
They just send another nigga to the morgue
A point scored, they could give a fuck about us
They rather catch us with guns and white powder
If I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me
Since I'm young, they consider me the enemy
They kill ten of me to get the job correct
To serve, protect, and break a nigga's neck
Cuz I'm the one with the trunk of funk
And ""Fuck tha Police"" in the tape deck
You should listen to me cuz there's more to see
Call my neighborhood a ghetto cuz it houses minorities

I can't fuck with them overseas
My homeboy died over ki's
Of cocaine, it was plain and simple
The 9mm went (buck) to the temple
(Buck, buck, buck) was the sound I put the bitch down
And ran to the schoolyard bathroom
Looked in the trash can, yo it had room
So I ducked my ass in it for a minute
Covered with trash I had to lay back
Mad as fuck, thinkin' about the payback
Tonight the crew gonna have a little fun
I went home and cut the barrel off my shotgun
It's gettin' critical - I stole a 5.0
I let it go - drive real slow
I yelled out ""Ice Cube, sucka""
The shotgun kicked, and it murdered motherfuckers
I told you last album
""When I got a sawed-off, bodies are hauled off""
Its a shame, that niggas die young
But to the light side it don't matter none
It'll be a drive by homicide

“If I could swim a thousand lakes to bring your life back...”  I write
That, but infinity can’t rewind facts.  You are
Divinity.  My primitive mind was struggling
Just to understand the meaning of life, forgive me
I never told my mommy, I couldn’t break her spirit.  She always
Wished her daughter extraordinary thinking, so I
Traveled alone, young, sixteen, got in
The habit of not staying at home, doing the
Sad walk like Bill Bixby, a dollar fifty
Trips to the hospital so that Medicaid could fix me
I couldn’t eat shit.  I fainted frequent
On cold floors and I pause and I think, “Keep it”
I’m lost.  My four friends know and just
Fuck at the boys’ apartments for rent, so I’m all
Wishing that it’s a dream ending soon.  I’ve actually
Erased a lot that I’ve been through

[Hook: Jean Grae]
See, when
The rain comes down
I know it’s falling for me
And only for me
And when
The pain comes around, there’s nowhere
Else I rather would be

Now all my bitter homies saying, “That’s what men do.”  Feeling
Retarded for seeing partner potential.  On top
Of that, the doctors telling me a heart murmur.  I can’t
Take it, I’m contemplating a Glock burner, a
Cop murderer.  I can’t leave.  This can’t be
The tears streaming, and I can’t see they lanced me
And I’m passing out, and this is just for blood.  They had
To cover the mass amounts.  I’ve had enough
And you don’t know what it’s like in waiting rooms, and out-
-side, their picketing pictures could slay you
They’re screaming, “Victims,” and spitting ‘til they shame you
I hold my head low and shiver, push my way through
They put you in a room where you can change into
Your gown and shower cap, shaking as a fiend would do
And that’s when you think of leaving, fleeing the building
And then they call you and you’re hearing the call of your children
They count down from ten now.  You wanna stop ‘em, but
You say it in your head: you’re out for the cut
And then you wake up in another room with plenty others
They call it recovery.  You’re thinking, “We ain’t mothers”
And then prescription pills, written a ‘script with chills
An understatement.  You’re dressed but you’re naked still
And your brain won’t think straight
Wait.  Can’t finish this

[Verse 3: Jean Grae]
I kept it bottled up.  My parents found the pills
Screaming, “God what have you done?”  Cried ‘til I snotted blood
Then got a gun.  My temple ran quick though
From the thought, then the worst: I was caught in the same place
A year later.  For me, that’s when hatred started
My faith martyred.  I’ve dated the father of a father
Then I moved on.  Years passed, the guilt’s
Worse and it builds ‘til your heart’s smashed
Then I miscarried.  Twenty-two age, I was headed to
A breakdown, swallowed up some pills and I laid down
I was a failure at that too, bailed from
The rap then, but fate took me back in
“Sing” is a tattoo my fingers attached with.  Twenty-seven
With three kids that I never met.  What if I
Was Catholic?  Wonder if they hate me, thinking how
Their mother could ever murder?  Well take me, Hell
To the depths where the brimstone chokes me constantly
I am a monster, see.  How could I possibly
Correspond with God when I gave the authority
To end their life?
But it’s never over, even if we have a child
They could have had a brother or a sister or both
I’m thinking about another life that almost got close
Praying that, in another time, we could have changed posts
If I could just reverse time, I would
I don’t know what I would do.  Honestly, it’s not good
I’m sorry...4Embed"

Knut's my name and here I float
Out on the sea in a great big boat
And I'm the one who beats the drum in time

To stroke the oars that drive our galleons on
And while we rowed we had our song
And we had our god and it may seem odd
But at least there was a cause

Caught a wind and we upped the sail
Lost two ships when it turned to a gale
Down went a third when she rammed on a whale
Though we despaired we could not fail
And through it all we never faltered

Late at night I lay on deck
Wondering why I risk my neck
Picture myself in a sinking wreck
And down I'm going not knowing why
I just can't quite recall the reason why

Finding a place to hide;
Why do they hunt him again?

His heart, it beats so fast;
No sound, they moved on at last
Timidly he wanders his way

The outcast, he enters their town
Senseless hate haunts him now;
The outcast with more feeling then they'll ever know

He only came for some food
Maybe even company;
Sometimes he feels so alone

He is the last one of his kind
All his companions have died;
Man signed their fatal destiny

His dreams tell him of ancient times
Of wolves and men running side by side;
How delightful freedom must have been

Wild woman's mate and totem-beast
Idolized he was, but suddenly all changed;
When the men with false dogmas came

A tear shines through the misty gloom

Life in it's livery
Stealing life from the land's living

Alone he sits by the lake
His image in the lake his only friend

1859,ML1860,Gil Scott-Heron,Whitey On The Moon,angry,"19 ContributorsWhitey on the Moon LyricsWe have a poem here, it's called ""Whitey On The Moon""
It was inspired by some whiteys on the moon
So I wanna give credit where credit is due
A rat done bit my sister Nell
With whitey on the moon
Her face and arms began to swell
And whitey's on the moon
I can't pay no doctor bills
But whitey's on the moon
Ten years from now I'll be payin' still
While whitey's on the moon
The man just upped my rent last night
Cause whitey's on the moon
No hot water, no toilets, no lights
But whitey's on the moon
I wonder why he's upping me?
Cause whitey's on the moon?
Well I was already giving him fifty a week
With whitey on the moon
Taxes taking my whole damn check
Junkies making me a nervous wreck
The price of food is going up
And as if all that shit wasn't enough:
A rat done bit my sister Nell
With whitey on the moon
Her face and arm began to swell
And whitey's on the moon
Was all that money I made last year
For whitey on the moon?
How come I ain't got no money here?
Hmm! Whitey's on the moon
Y'know I just 'bout had my fill
Of whitey on the moon
I think I'll send these doctor bills

1863,ML1864,The Germs,Sex Boy (Live),angry,"1 ContributorLittle Dorrit (Chap 2.34) LyricsGone


On a healthy autumn day, the Marshalsea prisoner, weak but otherwise restored, sat listening to a voice that read to him. On a healthy autumn day; when the golden fields had been reaped and ploughed again, when the summer fruits had ripened and waned, when the green perspectives of hops had been laid low by the busy pickers, when the apples clustering in the orchards were russet, and the berries of the mountain ash were crimson among the yellowing foliage. Already in the woods, glimpses of the hardy winter that was coming were to be caught through unaccustomed openings among the boughs where the prospect shone defined and clear, free from the bloom of the drowsy summer weather, which had rested on it as the bloom lies on the plum. So, from the seashore the ocean was no longer to be seen lying asleep in the heat, but its thousand sparkling eyes were open, and its whole breadth was in joyful animation, from the cool sand on the beach to the little sails on the horizon, drifting away like autumn-tinted leaves that had drifted from the trees. Changeless and barren, looking ignorantly at all the seasons with its fixed, pinched face of poverty and care, the prison had not a touch of any of these beauties on it. Blossom what would, its bricks and bars bore uniformly the same dead crop. Yet Clennam, listening to the voice as it read to him, heard in it all that great Nature was doing, heard in it all the soothing songs she sings to man. At no Mother's knee but hers had he ever dwelt in his youth on hopeful promises, on playful fancies, on the harvests of tenderness and humility that lie hidden in the early-fostered seeds of the imagination; on the oaks of retreat from blighting winds, that have the germs of their strong roots in nursery acorns.

But, in the tones of the voice that read to him, there were memories of an old feeling of such things, and echoes of every merciful and loving whisper that had ever stolen to him in his life.

When the voice stopped, he put his hand over his eyes, murmuring that the light was strong upon them.

Little Dorrit put the book by, and presently arose quietly to shade the window. Maggy sat at her needlework in her old place. The light softened, Little Dorrit brought her chair closer to his side.

'This will soon be over now, dear Mr Clennam. Not only are Mr Doyce's letters to you so full of friendship and encouragement, but Mr Rugg says his letters to him are so full of help, and that everybody (now a little anger is past) is so considerate, and speaks so well of you, that it will soon be over now.'

'Dear girl. Dear heart. Good angel!'

'You praise me far too much. And yet it is such an exquisite pleasure to me to hear you speak so feelingly, and to—and to see,' said Little Dorrit, raising her eyes to his, 'how deeply you mean it, that I cannot say Don't.'

He lifted her hand to his lips.

'You have been here many, many times, when I have not seen you, Little Dorrit?'

'Yes, I have been here sometimes when I have not come into the room.'

'Very often?'

'Rather often,' said Little Dorrit, timidly.
'Every day?'

'I think,' said Little Dorrit, after hesitating, 'that I have been here at least twice every day.' He might have released the little light hand after fervently kissing it again; but that, with a very gentle lingering where it was, it seemed to court being retained. He took it in both of his, and it lay softly on his breast.

'Dear Little Dorrit, it is not my imprisonment only that will soon be over. This sacrifice of you must be ended. We must learn to part again, and to take our different ways so wide asunder. You have not forgotten what we said together, when you came back?'

'O no, I have not forgotten it. But something has been—You feel quite strong to-day, don't you?'

'Quite strong.'

The hand he held crept up a little nearer his face.

'Do you feel quite strong enough to know what a great fortune I have got?'

'I shall be very glad to be told. No fortune can be too great or good for Little Dorrit.'

'I have been anxiously waiting to tell you. I have been longing and longing to tell you. You are sure you will not take it?'

'Never!'

'You are quite sure you will not take half of it?'

'Never, dear Little Dorrit!'

As she looked at him silently, there was something in her affectionate face that he did not quite comprehend: something that could have broken into tears in a moment, and yet that was happy and proud.
'You will be sorry to hear what I have to tell you about Fanny. Poor Fanny has lost everything. She has nothing left but her husband's income. All that papa gave her when she married was lost as your money was lost. It was in the same hands, and it is all gone.'

Arthur was more shocked than surprised to hear it. 'I had hoped it might not be so bad,' he said: 'but I had feared a heavy loss there, knowing the connection between her husband and the defaulter.'

'Yes. It is all gone. I am very sorry for Fanny; very, very, very sorry for poor Fanny. My poor brother too!' 'Had he property in the same hands?'

'Yes! And it's all gone.—How much do you think my own great fortune is?'

As Arthur looked at her inquiringly, with a new apprehension on him, she withdrew her hand, and laid her face down on the spot where it had rested.

'I have nothing in the world. I am as poor as when I lived here. When papa came over to England, he confided everything he had to the same hands, and it is all swept away. O my dearest and best, are you quite sure you will not share my fortune with me now?'

Locked in his arms, held to his heart, with his manly tears upon her own cheek, she drew the slight hand round his neck, and clasped it in its fellow-hand.

'Never to part, my dearest Arthur; never any more, until the last!

I never was rich before, I never was proud before, I never was happy before, I am rich in being taken by you, I am proud in having been resigned by you, I am happy in being with you in this prison, as I should be happy in coming back to it with you, if it should be the will of GOD, and comforting and serving you with all my love and truth. I am yours anywhere, everywhere! I love you dearly! I would rather pass my life here with you, and go out daily, working for our bread, than I would have the greatest fortune that ever was told, and be the greatest lady that ever was honoured. O, if poor papa may only know how blest at last my heart is, in this room where he suffered for so many years!'

Maggy had of course been staring from the first, and had of course been crying her eyes out long before this. Maggy was now so overjoyed that, after hugging her little mother with all her might, she went down-stairs like a clog-hornpipe to find somebody or other to whom to impart her gladness. Whom should Maggy meet but Flora and Mr F.'s Aunt opportunely coming in? And whom else, as a consequence of that meeting, should Little Dorrit find waiting for herself, when, a good two or three hours afterwards, she went out?

Flora's eyes were a little red, and she seemed rather out of spirits. Mr F.'s Aunt was so stiffened that she had the appearance of being past bending by any means short of powerful mechanical pressure. Her bonnet was cocked up behind in a terrific manner; and her stony reticule was as rigid as if it had been petrified by the Gorgon's head, and had got it at that moment inside. With these imposing attributes, Mr F.'s Aunt, publicly seated on the steps of the Marshal's official residence, had been for the two or three hours in question a great boon to the younger inhabitants of the Borough, whose sallies of humour she had considerably flushed herself by resenting at the point of her umbrella, from time to time.

'Painfully aware, Miss Dorrit, I am sure,' said Flora, 'that to propose an adjournment to any place to one so far removed by fortune and so courted and caressed by the best society must ever appear intruding even if not a pie-shop far below your present sphere and a back-parlour though a civil man but if for the sake of Arthur—cannot overcome it more improper now than ever late Doyce and Clennam—one last remark I might wish to make one last explanation I might wish to offer perhaps your good nature might excuse under pretence of three kidney ones the humble place of conversation.'

Rightly interpreting this rather obscure speech, Little Dorrit returned that she was quite at Flora's disposition. Flora accordingly led the way across the road to the pie-shop in question: Mr F.'s Aunt stalking across in the rear, and putting herself in the way of being run over, with a perseverance worthy of a better cause.
When the 'three kidney ones,' which were to be a blind to the conversation, were set before them on three little tin platters, each kidney one ornamented with a hole at the top, into which the civil man poured hot gravy out of a spouted can as if he were feeding three lamps, Flora took out her pocket-handkerchief.

'If Fancy's fair dreams,' she began, 'have ever pictured that when Arthur—cannot overcome it pray excuse me—was restored to freedom even a pie as far from flaky as the present and so deficient in kidney as to be in that respect like a minced nutmeg might not prove unacceptable if offered by the hand of true regard such visions have for ever fled and all is cancelled but being aware that tender relations are in contemplation beg to state that I heartily wish well to both and find no fault with either not the least, it may be withering to know that ere the hand of Time had made me much less slim than formerly and dreadfully red on the slightest exertion particularly after eating I well know when it takes the form of a rash, it might have been and was not through the interruption of parents and mental torpor succeeded until the mysterious clue was held by Mr F. still I would not be ungenerous to either and I heartily wish well to both.'

Little Dorrit took her hand, and thanked her for all her old kindness.

'Call it not kindness,' returned Flora, giving her an honest kiss, 'for you always were the best and dearest little thing that ever was if I may take the liberty and even in a money point of view a saving being Conscience itself though I must add much more agreeable than mine ever was to me for though not I hope more burdened than other people's yet I have always found it far readier to make one uncomfortable than comfortable and evidently taking a greater pleasure in doing it but I am wandering, one hope I wish to express ere yet the closing scene draws in and it is that I do trust for the sake of old times and old sincerity that Arthur will know that I didn't desert him in his misfortunes but that I came backwards and forwards constantly to ask if I could do anything for him and that I sat in the pie-shop where they very civilly fetched something warm in a tumbler from the hotel and really very nice hours after hours to keep him company over the way without his knowing it.'

Flora really had tears in her eyes now, and they showed her to great advantage.

'Over and above which,' said Flora, 'I earnestly beg you as the dearest thing that ever was if you'll still excuse the familiarity from one who moves in very different circles to let Arthur understand that I don't know after all whether it wasn't all nonsense between us though pleasant at the time and trying too and certainly Mr F. did work a change and the spell being broken nothing could be expected to take place without weaving it afresh which various circumstances have combined to prevent of which perhaps not the least powerful was that it was not to be, I am not prepared to say that if it had been agreeable to Arthur and had brought itself about naturally in the first instance I should not have been very glad being of a lively disposition and moped at home where papa undoubtedly is the most aggravating of his sex and not improved since having been cut down by the hand of the Incendiary into something of which I never saw the counterpart in all my life but jealousy is not my character nor ill-will though many faults.'

Without having been able closely to follow Mrs Finching through this labyrinth, Little Dorrit understood its purpose, and cordially accepted the trust.

'The withered chaplet my dear,' said Flora, with great enjoyment, 'is then perished the column is crumbled and the pyramid is standing upside down upon its what's-his-name call it not giddiness call it not weakness call it not folly I must now retire into privacy and look upon the ashes of departed joys no more but taking a further liberty of paying for the pastry which has formed the humble pretext of our interview will for ever say Adieu!'

Mr F.'s Aunt, who had eaten her pie with great solemnity, and who had been elaborating some grievous scheme of injury in her mind since her first assumption of that public position on the Marshal's steps, took the present opportunity of addressing the following Sibyllic apostrophe to the relict of her late nephew.

'Bring him for'ard, and I'll chuck him out o' winder!'

Flora tried in vain to soothe the excellent woman by explaining that they were going home to dinner. Mr F.'s Aunt persisted in replying, 'Bring him for'ard and I'll chuck him out o' winder!' Having reiterated this demand an immense number of times, with a sustained glare of defiance at Little Dorrit, Mr F.'s Aunt folded her arms, and sat down in the corner of the pie-shop parlour; steadfastly refusing to budge until such time as 'he' should have been 'brought for'ard,' and the chucking portion of his destiny accomplished.

In this condition of things, Flora confided to Little Dorrit that she had not seen Mr F.'s Aunt so full of life and character for weeks; that she would find it necessary to remain there 'hours perhaps,' until the inexorable old lady could be softened; and that she could manage her best alone. They parted, therefore, in the friendliest manner, and with the kindest feeling on both sides.

Mr F.'s Aunt holding out like a grim fortress, and Flora becoming in need of refreshment, a messenger was despatched to the hotel for the tumbler already glanced at, which was afterwards replenished. With the aid of its content, a newspaper, and some skimming of the cream of the pie-stock, Flora got through the remainder of the day in perfect good humour; though occasionally embarrassed by the consequences of an idle rumour which circulated among the credulous infants of the neighbourhood, to the effect that an old lady had sold herself to the pie-shop to be made up, and was then sitting in the pie-shop parlour, declining to complete her contract. This attracted so many young persons of both sexes, and, when the shades of evening began to fall, occasioned so much interruption to the business, that the merchant became very pressing in his proposals that Mr F.'s Aunt should be removed. A conveyance was accordingly brought to the door, which, by the joint efforts of the merchant and Flora, this remarkable woman was at last induced to enter; though not without even then putting her head out of the window, and demanding to have him 'brought for'ard' for the purpose originally mentioned. As she was observed at this time to direct baleful glances towards the Marshalsea, it has been supposed that this admirably consistent female intended by 'him,' Arthur Clennam.

This, however, is mere speculation; who the person was, who, for the satisfaction of Mr F.'s Aunt's mind, ought to have been brought forward and never was brought forward, will never be positively known.

The autumn days went on, and Little Dorrit never came to the Marshalsea now and went away without seeing him. No, no, no.

One morning, as Arthur listened for the light feet that every morning ascended winged to his heart, bringing the heavenly brightness of a new love into the room where the old love had wrought so hard and been so true; one morning, as he listened, he heard her coming, not alone.

'Dear Arthur,' said her delighted voice outside the door, 'I have some one here. May I bring some one in?'

He had thought from the tread there were two with her. He answered 'Yes,' and she came in with Mr Meagles. Sun-browned and jolly Mr Meagles looked, and he opened his arms and folded Arthur in them, like a sun-browned and jolly father.

'Now I am all right,' said Mr Meagles, after a minute or so. 'Now it's over. Arthur, my dear fellow, confess at once that you expected me before.' 'I did,' said Arthur; 'but Amy told me—' 'Little Dorrit. Never any other name.' (It was she who whispered it.)

'—But my Little Dorrit told me that, without asking for any further explanation, I was not to expect you until I saw you.'

'And now you see me, my boy,' said Mr Meagles, shaking him by the hand stoutly; 'and now you shall have any explanation and every explanation. The fact is, I was here—came straight to you from the Allongers and Marshongers, or I should be ashamed to look you in the face this day,—but you were not in company trim at the moment, and I had to start off again to catch Doyce.'

'Poor Doyce!' sighed Arthur.

'Don't call him names that he don't deserve,' said Mr Meagles.

'He's not poor; he's doing well enough. Doyce is a wonderful fellow over there. I assure you he is making out his case like a house a-fire. He has fallen on his legs, has Dan. Where they don't want things done and find a man to do 'em, that man's off his legs; but where they do want things done and find a man to do 'em, that man's on his legs. You won't have occasion to trouble the Circumlocution Office any more. Let me tell you, Dan has done without 'em!'

'What a load you take from my mind!' cried Arthur. 'What happiness you give me!'

'Happiness?' retorted Mr Meagles. 'Don't talk about happiness till you see Dan. I assure you Dan is directing works and executing labours over yonder, that it would make your hair stand on end to look at. He's no public offender, bless you, now! He's medalled and ribboned, and starred and crossed, and I don't-know-what all'd, like a born nobleman. But we mustn't talk about that over here.'

'Why not?'

'Oh, egad!' said Mr Meagles, shaking his head very seriously, 'he must hide all those things under lock and key when he comes over here. They won't do over here. In that particular, Britannia is a Britannia in the Manger—won't give her children such distinctions herself, and won't allow them to be seen when they are given by other countries. No, no, Dan!' said Mr Meagles, shaking his head again. 'That won't do here!'

'If you had brought me (except for Doyce's sake) twice what I have lost,' cried Arthur, 'you would not have given me the pleasure that you give me in this news.' 'Why, of course, of course,' assented Mr Meagles. 'Of course I know that, my good fellow, and therefore I come out with it in the first burst. Now, to go back, about catching Doyce. I caught Doyce. Ran against him among a lot of those dirty brown dogs in women's nightcaps a great deal too big for 'em, calling themselves Arabs and all sorts of incoherent races. YOU know 'em! Well! He was coming straight to me, and I was going to him, and so we came back together.'

'Doyce in England!' exclaimed Arthur.

'There!' said Mr Meagles, throwing open his arms. 'I am the worst man in the world to manage a thing of this sort. I don't know what I should have done if I had been in the diplomatic line—right, perhaps! The long and short of it is, Arthur, we have both been in England this fortnight. And if you go on to ask where Doyce is at the present moment, why, my plain answer is—here he is! And now I can breathe again at last!'

Doyce darted in from behind the door, caught Arthur by both hands, and said the rest for himself.

'There are only three branches of my subject, my dear Clennam,' said Doyce, proceeding to mould them severally, with his plastic thumb, on the palm of his hand, 'and they're soon disposed of. First, not a word more from you about the past. There was an error in your calculations. I know what that is. It affects the whole machine, and failure is the consequence. You will profit by the failure, and will avoid it another time. I have done a similar thing myself, in construction, often. Every failure teaches a man something, if he will learn; and you are too sensible a man not to learn from this failure. So much for firstly. Secondly. I was sorry you should have taken it so heavily to heart, and reproached yourself so severely; I was travelling home night and day to put matters right, with the assistance of our friend, when I fell in with our friend as he has informed you. Thirdly. We two agreed, that, after what you had undergone, after your distress of mind, and after your illness, it would be a pleasant surprise if we could so far keep quiet as to get things perfectly arranged without your knowledge, and then come and say that all the affairs were smooth, that everything was right, that the business stood in greater want of you than ever it did, and that a new and prosperous career was opened before you and me as partners. That's thirdly. But you know we always make an allowance for friction, and so I have reserved space to close in. My dear Clennam, I thoroughly confide in you; you have it in your power to be quite as useful to me as I have, or have had, it in my power to be useful to you; your old place awaits you, and wants you very much; there is nothing to detain you here one half-hour longer.'

There was silence, which was not broken until Arthur had stood for some time at the window with his back towards them, and until his little wife that was to be had gone to him and stayed by him.

'I made a remark a little while ago,' said Daniel Doyce then, 'which I am inclined to think was an incorrect one. I said there was nothing to detain you here, Clennam, half an hour longer. Am I mistaken in supposing that you would rather not leave here till to-morrow morning? Do I know, without being very wise, where you would like to go, direct from these walls and from this room?'

'You do,' returned Arthur. 'It has been our cherished purpose.'

'Very well!' said Doyce. 'Then, if this young lady will do me the honour of regarding me for four-and-twenty hours in the light of a father, and will take a ride with me now towards Saint Paul's Churchyard, I dare say I know what we want to get there.'

Little Dorrit and he went out together soon afterwards, and Mr Meagles lingered behind to say a word to his friend.

'I think, Arthur, you will not want Mother and me in the morning and we will keep away. It might set Mother thinking about Pet; she's a soft-hearted woman. She's best at the Cottage, and I'll stay there and keep her company.'

With that they parted for the time. And the day ended, and the night ended, and the morning came, and Little Dorrit, simply dressed as usual and having no one with her but Maggy, came into the prison with the sunshine. The poor room was a happy room that morning. Where in the world was there a room so full of quiet joy!

'My dear love,' said Arthur. 'Why does Maggy light the fire? We shall be gone directly.'

'I asked her to do it. I have taken such an odd fancy. I want you to burn something for me.'

'What?'

'Only this folded paper. If you will put it in the fire with your own hand, just as it is, my fancy will be gratified.'

'Superstitious, darling Little Dorrit? Is it a charm?'

'It is anything you like best, my own,' she answered, laughing with glistening eyes and standing on tiptoe to kiss him, 'if you will only humour me when the fire burns up.'

So they stood before the fire, waiting: Clennam with his arm about her waist, and the fire shining, as fire in that same place had often shone, in Little Dorrit's eyes. 'Is it bright enough now?' said Arthur. 'Quite bright enough now,' said Little Dorrit. 'Does the charm want any words to be said?' asked Arthur, as he held the paper over the flame. 'You can say (if you don't mind) ""I love you!""' answered Little Dorrit. So he said it, and the paper burned away.

They passed very quietly along the yard; for no one was there, though many heads were stealthily peeping from the windows.

Only one face, familiar of old, was in the Lodge. When they had both accosted it, and spoken many kind words, Little Dorrit turned back one last time with her hand stretched out, saying, 'Good-bye, good John! I hope you will live very happy, dear!'

Then they went up the steps of the neighbouring Saint George's Church, and went up to the altar, where Daniel Doyce was waiting in his paternal character. And there was Little Dorrit's old friend who had given her the Burial Register for a pillow; full of admiration that she should come back to them to be married, after all.

And they were married with the sun shining on them through the painted figure of Our Saviour on the window. And they went into the very room where Little Dorrit had slumbered after her party, to sign the Marriage Register. And there, Mr Pancks, (destined to be chief clerk to Doyce and Clennam, and afterwards partner in the house), sinking the Incendiary in the peaceful friend, looked in at the door to see it done, with Flora gallantly supported on one arm and Maggy on the other, and a back-ground of John Chivery and father and other turnkeys who had run round for the moment, deserting the parent Marshalsea for its happy child. Nor had Flora the least signs of seclusion upon her, notwithstanding her recent declaration; but, on the contrary, was wonderfully smart, and enjoyed the ceremonies mightily, though in a fluttered way.

Little Dorrit's old friend held the inkstand as she signed her name, and the clerk paused in taking off the good clergyman's surplice, and all the witnesses looked on with special interest. 'For, you see,' said Little Dorrit's old friend, 'this young lady is one of our curiosities, and has come now to the third volume of our Registers. Her birth is in what I call the first volume; she lay asleep, on this very floor, with her pretty head on what I call the second volume; and she's now a-writing her little name as a bride in what I call the third volume.'

They all gave place when the signing was done, and Little Dorrit and her husband walked out of the church alone. They paused for a moment on the steps of the portico, looking at the fresh perspective of the street in the autumn morning sun's bright rays, and then went down.

Went down into a modest life of usefulness and happiness. Went down to give a mother's care, in the fulness of time, to Fanny's neglected children no less than to their own, and to leave that lady going into Society for ever and a day. Went down to give a tender nurse and friend to Tip for some few years, who was never vexed by the great exactions he made of her in return for the riches he might have given her if he had ever had them, and who lovingly closed his eyes upon the Marshalsea and all its blighted fruits. They went quietly down into the roaring streets, inseparable and blessed; and as they passed along in sunshine and shade, the noisy and the eager, and the arrogant and the froward and the vain, fretted and chafed, and made their usual uproar.Embed"

1868,ML1869,Rivulets,Barreling Towards Nowhere Like There's No Tomorrow,sad,"6 ContributorsCryptonomicon LyricsPROLOGUE

Two tires fly. Two wail.

A bamboo grove, all chopped down

From it, warring songs

....IS THE BEST THAT CORPORAL BOBBY SHAFTOE CAN DO ON short notice--he's standing on the running board, gripping his Springfield with one hand and the rearview mirror with the other, so counting the syllables on his fingers is out of the question. Is ``tires'' one syllable or two? How about ``wail?'' The truck finally makes up its mind not to tip over, and thuds back onto four wheels. The wail--and the moment--are lost. Bobby can still hear the coolies singing, though, and now too there's the gunlike snicking of the truck's clutch linkage as Private Wiley downshifts. Could Wiley be losing his nerve? And, in the back, under the tarps, a ton and a half of file cabinets clanking, code books slaloming, fuel spanking the tanks of Station Alpha's electrical generator. The modern world's hell on haiku writers: ``Electrical generator'' is, what, eight syllables? You couldn't even fit that onto the second line!

""Are we allowed to run over people?'' Private Wiley inquires, and then mashes the horn button before Bobby Shaftoe can answer. A Sikh policeman hurdles a night soil cart. Shaftoe's gut reaction is: Sure, what're they going to do, declare war on us? but as the highest-ranking man on this truck he's probably supposed to be using his head or something, so he doesn't blurt it out just yet. He takes stock of the situation:

Shanghai, 1645 hours, Friday, the 28th of November 1941. Bobby Shaftoe, and the other half-dozen Marines on his truck, are staring down the length of Kiukiang Road, onto which they've just made this careening high-speed turn. Cathedral's going by to the right, so that means they are, what? two blocks away from the Bund. A Yangtze River Patrol gunboat is tied up there, waiting for the stuff they've got in the back of this truck. The only real problem is that those particular two blocks are inhabited by about five million Chinese people.

Now these Chinese are sophisticated urbanites, not suntanned yokels who've never seen cars before--they'll get out of your way if you drive fast and honk your horn. And indeed many of them flee to one side of the street or the other, producing the illusion that the truck its moving faster than the forty-three miles an hour shown on its speedometer.

But the bamboo grove in Bobby Shaftoe's haiku has not been added just to put a little Oriental flavor into the poem and wow the folks back home in Oconomowoc. There is a lot of heavy bamboo in front of this truck, dozens of makeshift turnpikes blocking their path to the river, for the officers of the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet, and of the Fourth Marines, who dreamed up this little operation forgot to take the Friday Afternoon factor into account. As Bobby Shaftoe could've explained to them, if only they'd bothered to ask a poor dumb jarhead, their route took them through the heart of the banking district. Here you've got the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank of course, City Bank, Chase Manhattan, the Bank of America, and BBME and the Agricultural Bank of China and any number of crappy little provincial banks, and several of those banks have contracts with what's left of the Chinese Government to print currency. It must be a cutthroat business because they slash costs by printing it on old newspapers, and if you know how to read Chinese, you can see last year's news stories and polo scores peeking through the colored numbers and pictures that transform these pieces of paper into legal tender.

As every chicken-peddler and rickshaw operator in Shanghai knows, the money-printing contracts stipulate that all of the bills these banks print have to be backed by such-and-such an amount of silver; i.e., anyone should be able to walk into one of those banks at the end of Kiukiang Road and slap down a pile of bills and (provided that those bills were printed by that same bank) receive actual metallic silver in exchange.

Now if China weren't right in the middle of getting systematically drawn and quartered by the Empire of Nippon, it would probably send official bean counters around to keep tabs on how much silver was actually present in these banks' vaults, and it would all be quiet and orderly. But as it stands, the only thing keeping these banks honest is the other banks.

Here's how they do it: during the normal course of business, lots of paper money will pass over the counters of (say) Chase Manhattan Bank. They'll take it into a back room and sort it, throwing into money boxes (a couple of feet square and a yard deep, with ropes on the four corners) all of the bills that were printed by (say) Bank of America in one, all of the City Bank bills into another. Then, on Friday afternoon they will bring in coolies. Each coolie, or pair of coolies, will of course have his great big long bamboo pole with him--a coolie without his pole is like a China Marine without his nickel-plated bayonet--and will poke their pole through the ropes on the corners of the box. Then one coolie will get underneath each end of the pole, hoisting the box into the air. They have to move in unison or else the box begins flailing around and everything gets out of whack. So as they head towards their destination--whatever bank whose name is printed on the bills in their box--they sing to each other, and plant their feet on the pavement in time to the music. The pole's pretty long, so they are that far apart, and they have to sing loud to hear each other, and of course each pair of coolies in the street is singing their own particular song, trying to drown out all of the others so that they don't get out of step.

So ten minutes before closing time on Friday afternoon, the doors of many banks burst open and numerous pairs of coolies march in singing, like the curtain-raiser on a fucking Broadway musical, slam their huge boxes of tattered currency down, and demand silver in exchange. All of the banks do this to each other. Sometimes, they'll all do it on the same Friday, particularly at times like 28 November 1941, when even a grunt like Bobby Shaftoe can understand that it's better to be holding silver than piles of old cut-up newspaper. And that is why, once the normal pedestrians and food-cart operators and furious Sikh cops have scurried out of the way, and plastered themselves up against the clubs and shops and bordellos on Kiukiang Road, Bobby Shaftoe and the other Marines on the truck still cannot even see the gunboat that is their destination, because of this horizontal forest of mighty bamboo poles. They cannot even hear the honking of their own truck horn because of the wild throbbing pentatonic cacophony of coolies singing. This ain't just your regular Friday P.M. Shanghai bank-district money-rush. This is an ultimate settling of accounts before the whole Eastern Hemisphere catches fire. The millions of promises printed on those slips of bumwad will all be kept or broken in the next ten minutes; actual pieces of silver and gold will move, or they won't. It is some kind of fiduciary Judgment Day.
``Jesus Christ, I can't--'' Private Wiley hollers.

""The captain said don't stop for any reason whatsofuckinever,'' Shaftoe reminds him. He's not telling Wiley to run over the coolies, he's reminding Wiley that if he refrains from running over them, they will have some explaining to do--which will be complicated by the fact that the captain's right behind them in a car stuffed with Tommy Gun-toting China Marines. And from the way the captain's been acting about this Station Alpha thing, it's pretty clear that he already has a few preliminary strap marks on his ass, courtesy of some admiral in Pearl Harbor or even (drumroll) Marine Barracks, Eight and Eye Streets Southeast, Washington, D.C.

Shaftoe and the other Marines have always known Station Alpha as a mysterious claque of pencil-necked swabbies who hung out on the roof of a building in the International Settlement in a shack of knot-pocked cargo pallet planks with antennas sticking out of it every which way. If you stood there long enough you could see some of those antennas moving, zeroing in on something out to sea. Shaftoe even wrote a haiku about it:

Antenna searches

Retriever's nose in the wind

Ether's far secrets

This was only his second haiku ever--clearly not up to November 1941 standards--and he cringes to remember it.

But in no way did any of the Marines comprehend what a big deal Station Alpha was until today. Their job had turned out to involve wrapping a ton of equipment and several tons of paper in tarps and moving it out of doors. Then they spent Thursday tearing the shack apart, making it into a bonfire, and burning certain books and papers.

``Sheeeyit!'' Private Wiley hollers. Only a few of the coolies have gotten out of the way, or even seen them. But then there is this fantastic boom from the river, like the sound of a mile-thick bamboo pole being snapped over God's knee. Half a second later there're no coolies in the street anymore--just a lot of boxes with unmanned bamboo poles teeter-tottering on them, bonging into the streets like wind-chimes. Above, a furry mushroom of grey smoke rises from the gunboat. Wiley shifts up to high gear and floors it. Shaftoe cringes against the truck's door and lowers his head, hoping that his campy Great War doughboy helmet will be good for something. Then money-boxes start to rupture and explode as the truck rams through them. Shaftoe peers up through a blizzard of notes and sees giant bamboo poles soaring and bounding and windmilling toward the waterfront.

The leaves of Shanghai:

Pale doorways in a steel sky.

Winter has begun.


BARRENS
Let's set the existence-of-god issue aside for a later volume, and just stipulate that in some way, self-replicating organisms came into existence on this planet and immediately began trying to get rid of each other, either by spamming their environments with rough copies of themselves, or by more direct means which hardly need to be belabored. Most of them failed, and their genetic legacy was erased from the universe forever, but a few found some way to survive and to propagate. After about three billion years of this sometimes zany, frequently tedious fugue of carnality and carnage, Godfrey Waterhouse IV was born, in Murdo, South Dakota, to Blanche, the wife of a Congregational preacher named Bunyan Waterhouse. Like every other creature on the face of the earth, Godfrey was, by birthright, a stupendous badass, albeit in the somewhat narrow technical sense that he could trace his ancestry back up a long line of slightly less highly evolved stupendous badasses to that first self-replicating gizmo--which, given the number and variety of its descendants, might justifiably be described as the most stupendous badass of all time. Everyone and everything that wasn't a stupendous badass was dead.



As nightmarishly lethal, memetically programmed death-machines went, these were the nicest you could ever hope to meet. In the tradition of his namesake (the Puritan writer John Bunyan, who spent much of his life in jail, or trying to avoid it) the Rev. Waterhouse did not preach in any one place for long. The church moved him from one small town in the Dakotas to another every year or two. It is possible that Godfrey found the lifestyle more than a little alienating, for, sometime during the course of his studies at Fargo Congregational College, he bolted from the fold and, to the enduring agony of his parents, fell into worldy pursuits, and ended up, somehow, getting a Ph.D. in Classics from a small private university in Ohio. Academics being no less nomadic than Congregational preachers, he took work where he could find it. He became a Professor of Greek and Latin at Bolger Christian College (enrollment 322) in West Point, Virginia, where the Mattaponi and Pamunkey Rivers came together to form the estuarial James, and the loathsome fumes of the big paper mill permeated every drawer, every closet, even the interior pages of books. Godfrey's young bride, nee Alice Pritchard, who had grown up following her itinerant-preacher father across the vastnesses of eastern Montana--where air smelt of snow and sage--threw up for three months. Six months later she gave birth to Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse.



The boy had a peculiar relationship with sound. When a fire engine passed, he was not troubled by the siren's howl or the bell's clang. But when a hornet got into the house and swung across the ceiling in a broad Lissajous, droning almost inaudibly, he cried in pain at the noise. And if he saw or smelled something that scared him, he would clap his hands over his ears.



One noise that troubled him not at all was the pipe organ in the chapel at Bolger Christian College. The chapel itself was nothing worth mentioning, but the organ had been endowed by the paper mill family and would have sufficed for a church four times the size. It nicely complemented the organist, a retired high school math teacher who felt that certain attributes of the Lord (violence and capriciousness in the Old Testament, majesty and triumph in the New) could be directly conveyed into the souls of the enpewed sinners through a kind of frontal sonic impregnation. That he ran the risk of blowing out the stained-glass windows was of no consequence since no one liked them anyway, and the paper mill fumes were gnawing at the interstitial lead. But after one little old lady too many staggered down the aisle after a service, reeling from tinnitus, and made a barbed comment to the minister about the exceedingly dramatic music, the organist was replaced.

Nevertheless, he continued to give lessons on the instrument. Students were not allowed to touch the organ until they were proficient at the piano, and when this was explained to Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse, he taught himself, in three weeks, how to play a Bach fugue, and signed up for organ lessons. Since he was only five years old at the time, he was unable to reach both the manuals and the pedals, and had to play standing--or rather strolling, from pedal to pedal.

When Lawrence was twelve, the organ broke down. That paper mill family had not left any endowment for maintenance, so the math teacher decided to have a crack at it. He was in poor health and required a nimble assistant: Lawrence, who helped him open up the hood of the thing. For the first time in all those years, the boy saw what had been happening when he had been pressing those keys.

For each stop--each timbre, or type of sound, that the organ could make (viz. blockflote, trumpet, piccolo)--there was a separate row of pipes, arranged in a line from long to short. Long pipes made low notes, short high. The tops of the pipes defined a graph: not a straight line but an upward-tending curve. The organist/math teacher sat down with a few loose pipes, a pencil, and paper, and helped Lawrence figure out why. When Lawrence understood, it was as if the math teacher had suddenly played the good part of Bach's Fantasia and Fugue in G Minor on a pipe organ the size of the Spiral Nebula in Andromeda--the part where Uncle Johann dissects the architecture of the Universe in one merciless descending ever-mutating chord, as if his foot is thrusting through skidding layers of garbage until it finally strikes bedrock. In particular, the final steps of the organist's explanation were like a falcon's dive through layer after layer of pretense and illusion, thrilling or sickening or confusing depending on what you were. The heavens were riven open. Lawrence glimpsed choirs of angels ranking off into geometrical infinity.

The pipes sprouted in parallel ranks from a broad flat box of compressed air. All of the pipes for a given note--but belonging to different stops--lined up with each other along one axis. All of the pipes for a given stop--but tuned at different pitches--lined up with each other along the other, perpendicular axis. Down there in the flat box of air, then, was a mechanism that got air to the right pipes at the right times. When a key or pedal was depressed, all of the pipes capable of sounding the corresponding note would speak, as long as their stops were pulled out.

Mechanically, all of this was handled in a fashion that was perfectly clear, simple, and logical. Lawrence had supposed that the machine must be at least as complicated as the most intricate fugue that could be played on it. Now he had learned that a machine, simple in its design, could produce results of infinite complexity.

Stops were rarely used alone. They tended to be piled on top of each other in combinations that were designed to take advantage of the available harmonics (more tasty mathematics here!). Certain combinations in particular were used over and over again. Lots of blockflo[autes, in varying lengths, for the quiet Offertory, for example. The organ included an ingenious mechanism called the preset, which enabled the organist to select a particular combination of stops--stops he himself had chosen--instantly. He would punch a button and several stops would bolt out from the console, driven by pneumatic pressure, and in that instant the organ would become a different instrument with entirely new timbres.
The next summer both Lawrence and Alice, his mother, were colonized by a distant cousin--a stupendous badass of a virus. Lawrence escaped from it with an almost imperceptible tendency to drag one of his feet. Alice wound up in an iron lung. Later, unable to cough effectively, she got pneumonia and died.

Lawrence's father Godfrey freely confessed that he was not equal to the burdens now laid on his shoulders. He resigned from his position at the small college in Virginia and moved, with his son, to a small house in Moorhead, Minnesota, next door to where Bunyan and Blanche had settled. Later he got a job teaching at a nearby normal school.

At this point, all of the responsible adults in Lawrence's life seemed to arrive at a tacit agreement that the best way to raise him--certainly the easiest--was to leave him alone. On the rare occasions when Lawrence requested adult intervention in his life, he was usually asking questions that no one could answer. At the age of sixteen, having found nothing in the local school system to challenge him, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse went off to college. He matriculated at Iowa State College, which among other things was the site of a Naval ROTC installation in which he was forcibly enrolled.

The Iowa State Naval ROTC had a band, and was delighted to hear that Lawrence had an interest in music. Since it was hard to drill on the deck of a dreadnought while playing a pipe organ, they issued him a glockenspiel and a couple of little dingers.

When not marching back and forth on the flood plain of the Skunk River making loud dinging noises, Lawrence was majoring in mechanical engineering. He ended up doing poorly in this area because he had fallen in with a Bulgarian professor named John Vincent Atanasoff and his graduate student, Clifford Berry, who were building a machine that was intended to automate the solution of some especially tedious differential equations.

The basic problem for Lawrence was that he was lazy. He had figured out that everything was much simpler if, like Superman with his X-ray vision, you just stared through the cosmetic distractions and saw the underlying mathematical skeleton. Once you found the math in a thing, you knew everything about it, and you could manipulate it to your heart's content with nothing more than a pencil and a napkin. He saw it in the curve of the silver bars on his glockenspiel, saw it in the catenary arch of a bridge and in the capacitor-studded drum of Atanasoff and Berry's computing machine. Actually pounding on the glockenspiel, riveting the bridge together, or trying to figure out why the computing machine wasn't working were not as interesting to him.

Consequently he got poor grades. From time to time, though, he would perform some stunt on the blackboard that would leave his professor weak in the knees and the other students baffled and hostile. Word got around.

At the same time, his grandmother Blanche was invoking her extensive Congregational connections, working the angles on Lawrence's behalf, totally unbeknownst to him. Her efforts culminated in triumph when Lawrence was awarded an obscure scholarship, endowed by a St. Paul oat-processing heir, whose purpose was to send Midwestern Congregationalists to the Ivy League for one year, which (evidently) was deemed a long enough period of time to raise their IQs by a few crucial points but not long enough to debauch them. So Lawrence got to be a sophomore in Princeton.

Now Princeton was an august school and going there was a great honor, but no one got around to mentioning either of these facts to Lawrence, who had no way of knowing. This had bad and good consequences. He accepted the scholarship with a faintness of gratitude that infuriated the oat lord. On the other hand, he adjusted to Princeton easily because it was just another place. It reminded him of the nicer bits of Virginia, and there were some nice pipe organs in town, though he was not all that happy with his engineering homework of bridge-designing and sprocket-cutting problems. As always, these eventually came down to math, most of which he could handle easily. From time to time he would get stuck, though, which led him to the Fine Hall: the headquarters of the Math Department.

There was a motley assortment of fellows wandering around in Fine Hall, many sporting British or European accents. Administratively speaking, many of these fellows were not members of the Math Department at all, but a separate thing called IAS, which stood for Institute for Advanced something-or-other. But they were all in the same building and they all knew a thing or two about math, so the distinction didn't exist for Lawrence.

Quite a few of these men would pretend shyness when Lawrence sought their advice, but others were at least willing to hear him out. For example: he had come up with a way to solve a difficult sprocket tooth shape problem that, as normally solved by engineers, would require any number of perfectly reasonable but aesthetically displeasing approximations. Lawrence's solution would provide exact results. The only drawback was that it would require a quintillion slide-rule operators a quintillion years to solve. Lawrence was working on a radically different approach that, if it worked, would bring those figures down to a trillion and a trillion respectively. Unfortunately, Lawrence was unable to interest anyone at Fine Hall in anything as prosaic as gears, until all of a sudden he made friends with an energetic British fellow, whose name he promptly forgot, but who had been doing a lot of literal sprocket-making himself lately. This fellow was trying to build, of all things, a mechanical calculating machine--specifically a machine to calculate certain values of the Riemann Zeta Function.


certain values of the Riemann Zeta Function.

[equation cannot be rendered in text]

where s is a complex number.

Lawrence found this zeta function to be no more and no less interesting than any other math problem until his new friend assured him that it was frightfully important, and that some of the best mathematicians in the world had been gnawing on it for decades. The two of them ended up staying awake until three in the morning working out the solution to Lawrence's sprocket problem. Lawrence presented the results proudly to his engineering professor, who snidely rejected it, on grounds of practicality, and gave him a poor grade for his troubles.

Lawrence finally remembered, after several more contacts, that the name of the friendly Brit was Al something-or-other. Because Al was a passionate cyclist, he and Al went on quite a few bicycle rides through the countryside of the Garden State. As they rode around New Jersey, they talked about math, and particularly about machines for taking the dull part of math off their hands.

But Al had been thinking about this subject for longer than Lawrence, and had figured out that computing machines were much more than just labor-saving devices. He'd been working on a radically different sort of computing mechanism that would work out any arithmetic problem whatsoever, as long as you knew how to write the problem down. From a pure logic standpoint, he had already figured out everything there was to know about this (as yet hypothetical) machine, though he had yet to build one. Lawrence gathered that actually building machinery was looked on as undignified at Cambridge (England, that is, where this Al character was based) or for that matter at Fine Hall. Al was thrilled to have found, in Lawrence, someone who did not share this view.

Al delicately asked him, one day, if Lawrence would terribly mind calling him by his full and proper name, which was Alan and not Al. Lawrence apologized and said he would try very hard to keep it in mind.

One day a couple of weeks later, as the two of them sat by a running stream in the woods above the Delaware Water Gap, Alan made some kind of an outlandish proposal to Lawrence involving penises. It required a great deal of methodical explanation, which Alan delivered with lots of blushing and stuttering. He was ever so polite, and several times emphasized that he was acutely aware that not everyone in the world was interested in this sort of thing.

Lawrence decided that he was probably one of those people.

Alan seemed vastly impressed that Lawrence had paused to think about it at all and apologized for putting him out. They went directly back to a discussion of computing machines, and their friendship continued unchanged. But on their next bicycle ride--an overnight camping trip to the Pine Barrens--they were joined by a new fellow, a German named Rudy von something-or-other.

Alan and Rudy's relationship seemed closer, or at least more multilayered, than Alan and Lawrence's. Lawrence concluded that Alan's penis scheme must have finally found a taker.

It got Lawrence to thinking. From an evolution standpoint, what was the point of having people around who were not inclined to have offspring? There must be some good, and fairly subtle, reason for it.

The only thing he could work out was that it was groups of people--societies--rather than individual creatures, who were now trying to out-reproduce and/or kill each other, and that, in a society, there was plenty of room for someone who didn't have kids as long as he was up to something useful.

Alan and Rudy and Lawrence rode south, anyway, looking for the Pine Barrens. After a while the towns became very far apart, and the horse farms gave way to a low stubble of feeble, spiny trees that appeared to extend all the way to Florida--blocking their view, but not the headwind. ``Where are the Pine Barrens I wonder?'' Lawrence asked a couple of times. He even stopped at a gas station to ask someone that question. His companions began to make fun of him.

``Vere are ze Pine Barrens?'' Rudy inquired, looking about quizzically.

``I should look for something rather barren-looking, with numerous pine trees,'' Alan mused.

There was no other traffic and so they had spread out across the road to pedal three abreast, with Alan in the middle.

``A forest, as Kafka would imagine it,'' Rudy muttered.

By this point Lawrence had figured out that they were, in fact, in the Pine Barrens. But he didn't know who Kafka was. ``A mathematician?'' he guessed.

``Zat is a scary sing to sink of,'' Rudy said.

``He is a writer,'' Alan said. ``Lawrence, please don't be offended that I ask you this, but: do you recognize any other people's names at all? Other than family and close friends, I mean.''

Lawrence must have looked baffled. ``I'm trying to figure out whether it all comes from in here,'' Alan said, reaching out to rap his knuckles on the side of Lawrence's head, ``or do you sometimes take in new ideas from other human beings?''


``When I was a little boy, I saw angels in a church in Virginia,'' Lawrence said, ``but I think that they came from inside my head.''

``Very well,'' Alan said.

But later Alan had another go at it. They had reached the fire lookout tower and it had been a thunderous disappointment: just an alienated staircase leading nowhere, and a small cleared area below that was glittery with shards of liquor bottles. They pitched their tent by the side of a pond that turned out to be full of rust-colored algae that stuck to the hairs on their bodies. Then there was nothing left to do but drink schnapps and talk about math.


Alan said, ``Look, it's like this: Bertrand Russell and another chap named Whitehead wrote Principia Mathematica...''


``Now I know you're pulling my leg,'' Waterhouse said. ``Even I know that Sir Isaac Newton wrote that.''


``Newton wrote a different book, also called Principia Mathematica, which isn't really about mathematics at all; it's about what we would today call physics.''


``Then why did he call it Principia Mathematica?''


``Because the distinction between mathematics and physics wasn't especially clear in Newton's day--''


``Or maybe even in zis day,'' Rudy said.


``--which is directly relevant to what I'm talking about,'' Alan continued. ``I am talking about Russell's P.M., in which he and Whitehead started absolutely from scratch, I mean from nothing, and built it all up--all mathematics--from a small number of first principles. And why I am telling you this, Lawrence, is that--Lawrence! Pay attention!''


``Hmmm?''


``Rudy--take this stick, here--that's right--and keep a close eye on Lawrence, and when he gets that foggy look on his face, poke him with it!''


``Zis is not an English school, you can't do zese kind of sing.''


``I'm listening,'' Lawrence said.


``What came out of P.M., which was terrifically radical, was the ability to say that all of math, really, can be expressed as a certain ordering of symbols.''

``Leibniz said it a long time before zen!'' protested Rudy.

``Er, Leibniz invented the notation we use for calculus, but--''

``I'm not talking about zat!''

``And he invented matrices, but--''

``I'm not talking about zat eezer!''

``And he did some work with binary arithmetic, but--''

``Zat is completely different!''

``Well, what the hell are you talking about, then, Rudy?''

``Leibniz invented ze basic alphabet--wrote down a set of symbols, for expressing statements about logic.''

``Well, I wasn't aware that Herr Leibniz counted formal logic among his interests, but--''

``Of course! He wanted to do what Russell and Whitehead did, except not just with mathematics, but with everything in ze whole world!''

``Well from the fact that you are the only man on the planet, Rudy, who seems to know about this undertaking of Leibniz's, can we assume that he failed?''

``You can assume anything that pleases your fancy, Alan,'' Rudy responded, ``but I am a mathematician and I do not assume anything.''

Alan sighed woundedly, and gave Rudy a Significant Look which Waterhouse assumed meant that there would be trouble later. ``If I may just make some headway, here,'' he said, ``all I'm really trying to get you to agree on, is that mathematics can be expressed as a series of symbols,'' (he snatched the Lawrence-poking stick and began drawing things like  the dirt) ``and frankly I could not care less whether they happen to be Leibniz's symbols, or Russell's, or the hexagrams of the I Ching....''

``Leibniz was fascinated by the I Ching!'' Rudy began.

``Shut up about Leibniz for a moment, Rudy, because look here: You--Rudy--and I are on a train, as it were, sitting in the dining car, having a nice conversation, and that train is being pulled along at a terrific clip by certain locomotives named The Bertrand Russell and Riemann and Euler and others. And our friend Lawrence is running alongside the train, trying to keep up with us--it's not that we're smarter than he is, necessarily, but that he's a farmer who didn't get a ticket. And I, Rudy, am simply reaching out through the open window here, trying to pull him onto the fucking train with us so that the three of us can have a nice little chat about mathematics without having to listen to him panting and gasping for breath the whole way.''

``All right, Alan.''

``Won't take a minute if you will just stop interrupting.''

``But there is a locomotive too named Leibniz.''

``Is it that you don't think I give enough credit to Germans? Because I am about to mention a fellow with an umlaut.''

``Oh, would it be Herr Turing?'' Rudy said slyly.

``Herr Turing comes later. I was actually thinking of Godel.''

``But he's not German! He's Austrian!''

``I'm afraid that it's all the same now, isn't it?''

``Ze Anschluss wasn't my idea, you don't have to look at me that way, I think Hitler is appalling.''

``I've heard of Godel,'' Waterhouse put in helpfully. ``But could we back up just a sec?''

``Of course Lawrence.''

``Why bother? Why did Russell do it? Was there something wrong with math? I mean, two plus two equals four, right?''

Alan picked up two bottlecaps and set them down on the ground. ``Two. One-two. Plus--'' He set down two more. ``Another two. One-two. Equals four. One-two-three-four.''

``What's so bad about that?'' Lawrence said.

``But Lawrence--when you really do math, in an abstract way, you're not counting bottlecaps, are you?''

``I'm not counting anything.''

Rudy broke the following news: ``Zat is a very modern position for you to take.''

``It is?''

Alan said, ``There was this implicit belief, for a long time, that math was a sort of physics of bottlecaps. That any mathematical operation you could do on paper, no matter how complicated, could be reduced--in theory, anyway--to messing about with actual physical counters, such as bottlecaps, in the real world.''

``But you can't have two point one bottlecaps.''

``All right, all right, say we use bottlecaps for integers, and for real numbers like two point one, we use physical measurements, like the length of this stick.'' Alan tossed the stick down next to the bottlecaps.

``Well what about pi, then? You can't have a stick that's exactly pi inches long.''

``Pi is from geometry--ze same story,'' Rudy put in.

``Yes, it was believed that Euclid's geometry was really a kind of physics, that his lines and so on represented properties of the physical world. But--you know Einstein?''

``I'm not very good with names.''

``That white-haired chap with the big mustache?''

``Oh, yeah,'' Lawrence said dimly, ``I tried to ask him my sprocket question. He claimed he was late for an appointment or something.''

``That fellow has come up with a general relativity theory, which is sort of a practical application, not of Euclid's, but of Riemann's geometry--''

``The same Riemann of your zeta function?''

``Same Riemann, different subject. Now let's not get sidetracked here Lawrence--''

``Riemann showed you could have many many different geometries that were not the geometry of Euclid but that still made sense internally,'' Rudy explained.

``All right, so back to P.M. then,'' Lawrence said.

``Yes! Russell and Whitehead. It's like this: when mathematicians began fooling around with things like the square root of negative one, and quaternions, then they were no longer dealing with things that you could translate into sticks and bottlecaps. And yet they were still getting sound results.''

``Or at least internally consistent results,'' Rudy said.

``Okay. Meaning that math was more than a physics of bottlecaps.''

``It appeared that way, Lawrence, but this raised the question of was mathematics really true or was it just a game played with symbols? In other words--are we discovering Truth, or just wanking?''

``It has to be true because if you do physics with it, it all works out! I've heard of that general relativity thing, and I know they did experiments and figured out it was true.''

``Ze great majority of mathematics does not lend itself to experimental testing,'' Rudy said.

``The whole idea of this project is to sever the ties to physics,'' Alan said.

``And yet not to be vanking ourselves.''

``That's what P.M. was trying to do?''

``Russell and Whitehead broke all mathematical concepts down into brutally simple things like sets. From there they got to integers, and so on.''

``But how can you break something like pi down into a set?''

``You can't,'' Alan said, ``but you can express it as a long string of digits. Three point one four one five nine, and so on.''

``And digits are integers,'' Rudy said.

``But no fair! Pi itself is not an integer!''

``But you can calculate the digits of pi, one at a time, by using certain formulas. And you can write down the formulas like so!'' Alan scratches this in the dirt:



``I have used the Leibniz series in order to placate our friend. See, Lawrence? It is a string of symbols.''

``Okay. I see the string of symbols,'' Lawrence said reluctantly.

``Can we move on? Godel said, just a few years ago, `Say! If you buy into this business about mathematics being just strings of symbols, guess what?' And he pointed out that any string of symbols--such as this very formula, here--can be translated into integers.''

``How?''

``Nothing fancy, Lawrence--it's just simple encryption. Arbitrary. The number `538' might be written down instead of this great ugly £, and so on.''

``Seems pretty close to wanking, now.''

``No, no. Because then Godel sprang the trap! Formulas can act on numbers, right?''

``Sure. Like 2x.''

``Yes. You can substitute any number for x and the formula 2x will double it. But if another mathematical formula, such as this one right here, for calculating pi, can be encoded as a number, then you can have another formula act on it. Formulas acting on formulas!''

``Is that all?''

``No. Then he showed, really through a very simple argument, that if formulas really can refer to themselves, it's possible to write one down saying `this statement cannot be proved.' Which was tremendously startling to Hilbert and everyone else, who expected the opposite result.''

``Have you mentioned this Hilbert guy before?''

``No, he is new to this discussion, Lawrence.''

``Who is he?''

``A man who asks difficult questions. He asked a whole list of them once. Go[audel answered one of them.''

``And Turing answered another,'' Rudy said.

``Who's that?''

``It's me,'' Alan said. ``But Rudy's joking. `Turing' doesn't really have an umlaut in it.''

``He's going to have an umlaut in him later tonight,'' Rudy said, looking at Alan in a way that, in retrospect, years later, Lawrence would understand to have been smoldering.

``Well, don't keep me in suspense. Which one of his questions did you answer?''

``The Entscheidungsproblem,'' Rudy said.

``Meaning?''

Alan explained, ``Hilbert wanted to know whether any given statement could, in principle, be found true or false.''

``But after Godel got finished, it changed,'' Rudy pointed out.

``That's true--after Godel it became `Can we determine whether any given statement is provable or non-provable?' In other words, is there some sort of mechanical process we could use to separate the provable statements from the nonprovable ones?''

`` `Mechanical process' is supposed to be a metaphor, Alan....''

``Oh, stop it, Rudy! Lawrence and I are quite comfortable with machinery.''

``I get it,'' Lawrence said.

``What do you mean, you get it?'' Alan said.

``Your machine--not the zeta-function calculator, but the other one. The one we've been talking about building--''

``It is called Universal Turing Machine,'' Rudy said.

``The whole point of that gizmo is to separate provable from nonprovable statements, isn't it?''

``That's why I came up with the basic idea for it,'' Alan said. ``So Hilbert's question has been answered. Now I just want to actually build one so that I can beat Rudy at chess.''

``You haven't told poor Lawrence the answer yet!'' Rudy protested.

``Lawrence can figure it out,'' Alan said. ``It'll give him something to do.''

Soon it became clear that Alan really meant: It'll give him something to do while we're fucking. Lawrence shoved a notebook into the waistband of his trousers and rode his bicycle a few hundred yards to the fire tower, then climbed up the stairs to the platform at the top and sat down, back to the setting sun, notebook propped up on his knees to catch the light.

He could not collect his thoughts, and then he was distracted by a false sunrise that lit up the clouds off to the northeast. He thought at first that some low clouds were bouncing fragments of the sunset back to him, but it was too concentrated and flickering for that. Then he thought it was lightning. But the color of the light was not blue enough. It fluctuated sharply, modulated by (one had to assume) great, startling events that were occulted by the horizon. As the sun went down on the opposite side of the world, the light on the New Jersey horizon focused to a steady, lambent core the color of a flashlight when you shine it through the palm of your hand under the bedsheets.

Lawrence climbed down the stairs and got on his bicycle and rode through the Pine Barrens. Before long he came to a road that led in the general direction of the light. Most of the time he could not see anything, not even the road, but after a couple of hours the glow bouncing off the low cloud layer lit up flat stones in the road, and turned the barrens' wandering rivulets into glowing crevices.

The road began to tend in the wrong direction and so Lawrence cut directly into the woods, because he was very close now, and the light in the sky was strong enough that he could see it through the sparse carpet of scrubby pines--black sticks that appeared to have been burned, though they hadn't. The ground had turned into sand, but it was damp and compacted, and his bicycle had fat tires that rode over it well. At one point he had to stop and throw the bike over a barbed-wire fence. Then he broke out of the sticks and onto a perfectly flat expanse of white sand, stitched down with tufts of beach grass, and just then he was dazzled by a low fence of quiet steady flames that ran across a part of the horizon about as wide as the harvest moon when it sinks into the sea. Its brightness made it difficult to see anything else--Lawrence kept riding into little ditches and creeks that meandered across the flats. He learned not to stare directly at the flames. Looking off to the sides was more interesting anyway: the table-land was marked at wide intervals by the largest buildings he had ever seen, cracker-box structures built by Pharaohs, and in the mile-wide plazas between them, gnomons of triangulated steel were planted in wide stances: the internal skeletons of pyramids. The largest of these pierced the center of a perfectly circular railway line a few hundred feet in diameter: two argent curves scored on the dull ground, interrupted in one place where the tower's shadow, a stopped sundial, told the time. He rode by a building smaller than the others, with oval tanks standing next to it. Steam murmured from valves on the tops of the tanks, but instead of rising into the air it dribbled down the sides and struck the ground and spread out, coating the sea-grass with jackets of silver.

A thousand sailors in white were standing in a ring around the long flame. One of them held up his hand and waved Lawrence down. Lawrence came to a stop next to the sailor and planted one foot on the sand to steady himself. He and the sailor stared at each other for a moment and then Lawrence, who could not think of anything else, said, ``I am in the Navy also.'' Then the sailor seemed to make up his mind about something. He saluted Lawrence through, and pointed him towards a small building off to the side of the fire.

The building looked only like a wall glowing in the firelight, but sometimes a barrage of magnesium blue light made its windowframes jump out of the darkness, a rectangular lightning-bolt that echoed many times across the night. Lawrence started pedaling again and rode past that building: a spiraling flock of alert fedoras, prodding at slim terse notebooks with stately Ticonderogas, crab-walking photogs turning their huge chrome daisies, crisp rows of people sleeping with blankets over their faces, a sweating man with Brilliantined hair chalking umlauted names on a blackboard. Finally coming around this building he smelled hot fuel oil, felt the heat of the flames on his face and saw beach-glass curled toward it and desiccated.

He stared down upon the world's globe, not the globe fleshed with continents and oceans but only its skeleton: a burst of meridians, curving backwards to cage an inner dome of orange flame. Against the light of the burning oil those longitudes were thin and crisp as a draftsman's ink-strokes. But coming closer he saw them resolve into clever works of rings and struts, hollow as a bird's bones. As they spread away from the pole they sooner or later began to wander, or split into bent parts, or just broke off and hung in the fire oscillating like dry stalks. The perfect geometry was also mottled, here and there, by webs of cable and harnesses of electrical wiring. Lawrence almost rode over a broken wine bottle and decided he should now walk, to spare his bicycle's tires, so he laid the bike down, the front wheel covering an aluminum vase that appeared to have been spun on a lathe, with a few charred roses hanging out of it. Some sailors had joined their hands to form a sort of throne, and were bearing along a human-shaped piece of charcoal dressed in a coverall of immaculate asbestos. As they walked the toes of their shoes caught in vast, ramified snarls of ropes and piano-wires, cables and wires, creative furtive movements in the grass and the sand dozens of yards every direction. Lawrence began planting his feet very thoughtfully one in front of the other, trying to measure the greatness of what he had come and seen. A rocket-shaped pod stuck askew from the sand, supporting an umbrella of bent-back propellers. The duralumin struts and catwalks rambled on above him for miles. There was a suitcase spilled open, with a pair of women's shoes displayed as if in the window of a downtown store, and a menu that had been charred to an oval glow, and then some tousled wall-slabs, like a whole room that had dropped out of the sky--these were decorated, one with a giant map of the world, great circles arcing away from Berlin to pounce on cities near and far, and another with a photograph of a famous, fat German in a uniform, grinning on a flowered platform, the giant horizon of a new Zeppelin behind him.

After a while he stopped seeing new things. Then he got on his bicycle and rode back through the Pine Barrens. He got lost in the dark and so didn't find his way back to the fire tower until dawn. But he didn't mind being lost because while he rode around in the dark he thought about the Turing machine. Finally he came back to the shore of the pond where they had camped. The dawn-light shining on the saucer of calm reddish water made it look like a pool of blood. Alan Mathison Turing and Rudolf von Hacklheber were lying together like spoons on the shore, still smudged a little bit from their swim yesterday. Lawrence started a little fire and made some tea and they woke up eventually.

``Did you solve the problem?'' Alan asked him.

``Well you can turn that Universal Turing Machine of yours into any machine by changing the presets--''

``Presets?''

``Sorry, Alan, I think of your U.T.M. as being kind of like a pipe organ.''

``Oh.''

``Once you've done that, anyway, you can do any calculation you please, if the tape is long enough. But gosh, Alan, making a tape that's long enough, and that you can write symbols on, and erase them, is going to be sort of tricky--Atanasoff's capacitor drum would only work up to a certain size--you'd have to--''

``This is a digression,'' Alan said gently.

``Yeah, okay, well--if you had a machine like that, then any given preset could be represented by a number--a string of symbols. And the tape that you would feed into it to start the calculation would contain another string of symbols. So it's Go[audel's proof all over again--if any possible combination of machine and data can be represented by a string of numbers, then you can just arrange all of the possible strings of numbers into a big table, and then it turns into a Cantor diagonal type of argument, and the answer is that there must be some numbers that cannot be computed.''

``And ze Entscheidungsproblem?'' Rudy reminded him.

``Proving or disproving a formula--once you've encrypted the formula into numbers, that is--is just a calculation on that number. So it means that the answer to the question is, no! Some formulas cannot be proved or disproved by any mechanical process! So I guess there's some point in being human after all!''

Alan looked pleased until Lawrence said this last thing, and then his face collapsed. ``Now there you go making unwarranted assumptions.''

``Don't listen to him, Lawrence!'' Rudy said. ``He's going to tell you that our brains are Turing machines.''

``Thank you, Rudy,'' Alan said patiently. ``Lawrence, I submit that our brains are Turing machines.''

``But you proved that there's a whole lot of formulas that a Turing machine can't process!''

``And you have proved it too, Lawrence.''

``But don't you think that we can do some things that a Turing machine couldn't?''

``Godel agrees with you, Lawrence,'' Rudy put in, ``and so does Hardy.''

``Give me one example,'' Alan said.

``Of a noncomputable function that a human can do, and a Turing machine can't?''

``Yes. And don't give me any sentimental nonsense about creativity. I believe that a Universal Turing Machine could show behaviors that we would construe as creative.''

``Well, I don't know then... I'll try to keep my eye out for that kind of thing in the future.''

But later, as they were riding back towards Princeton, he said, ``What about dreams?''

``Like those angels in Virginia?''

``I guess so.''

``Just noise in the neurons, Lawrence.''

``Also I dreamed last night that a zeppelin was burning.''



Soon, Alan got his Ph.D. and went back to England. He wrote Lawrence a couple of letters. The last of these stated, simply, that he would not be able to write Lawrence any more letters ``of substance'' and that Lawrence should not take it personally. Lawrence perceived right away that Alan's society had put him to work doing something useful--probably figuring out how to keep it from being eaten alive by certain of its neighbors. Lawrence wondered what use America would find for him.

He went back to Iowa State, considered changing his major to mathematics, but didn't. It was the consensus of all whom he consulted that mathematics, like pipe-organ restoration, was a fine thing, but that one needed some way to put bread on the table. He remained in engineering and did more and more poorly at it until the middle of his senior year, when the university suggested that he enter a useful line of work, such as roofing. He walked straight out of college into the waiting arms of the Navy.

They gave him an intelligence test. The first question on the math part had to do with boats on a river: Port Smith is 100 miles upstream of Port Jones. The river flows at 5 miles per hour. The boat goes through water at 10 miles per hour. How long does it take to go from Port Smith to Port Jones? How long to come back?

Lawrence immediately saw that it was a trick question. You would have to be some kind of idiot to make the facile assumption that the current would add or subtract 5 miles per hour to or from the speed of the boat. Clearly, 5 miles per hour was nothing more than the average speed. The current would be faster in the middle of the river and slower at the banks. More complicated variations could be expected at bends in the river. Basically it was a question of hydrodynamics, which could be tackled using certain well-known systems of differential equations. Lawrence dove into the problem, rapidly (or so he thought) covering both sides of ten sheets of paper with calculations. Along the way, he realized that one of his assumptions, in combination with the simplified Navier-Stokes equations, had led him into an exploration of a particularly interesting family of partial differential equations. Before he knew it, he had proved a new theorem. If that didn't prove his intelligence, what would?

Then the time bell rang and the papers were collected. Lawrence managed to hang onto his scratch paper. He took it back to his dorm, typed it up, and mailed it to one of the more approachable math professors at Princeton, who promptly arranged for it to be published in a Parisian mathematics journal.

Lawrence received two free, freshly printed copies of the journal a few months later, in San Diego, California, during mail call on board a large ship called the U.S.S. Nevada. The ship had a band, and the Navy had given Lawrence the job of playing the glockenspiel in it, because their testing procedures had proven that he was not intelligent enough to do anything else.

The sack of mail carrying Lawrence's contribution to the mathematical literature arrived just in the nick of time. Lawrence's ship, and quite a few of her sisters, had until then been based in California. But at just this moment, all of them were transferred to some place called Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, in order to show the Nips who was boss.

Lawrence had never really known what he wanted to do with his life, but he quickly decided that being glockenspiel player on a battleship in Hawaii during peacetime was a long way from the worst life you could possibly have. The harshest part of the job was sometimes having to sit or march in very warm conditions, and enduring occasional fluffed notes by other band members. He had abundant free time, which he spent working on a series of new theorems in the field of information theory. The field had been invented and pretty much encompassed by his friend Alan, but there was much detail work to be done. He and Alan and Rudy had sketched out a general plan of what needed to be proved or disproved. Lawrence tore through the list. He wondered what Alan and Rudy were up to in Britain and Germany, but he couldn't write to them and find out, so he kept his work to himself. When he wasn't playing the glockenspiel or working out theorems, there were bars and dances to go to. Waterhouse did some penis work of his own, got the clap, had it cured,* bought condoms. All of the sailors did this. They were like three-year olds who shove pencils in their ears, discover that it hurts, and stop doing it. Lawrence's first year went by almost instantly. Time just blazed by. Nowhere could be sunnier, more relaxing, than Hawaii.

*1940 being a good year to begin experimenting with venereal diseases in that the new injectable penicillin was just becoming available



NOVUS ORDO SECLORUM

``Filipinos are a warm, gentle, caring, giving people,'' avi says, ``which is a good thing since so many of them carry concealed weapons.''

Randy is in Tokyo's airport, ambling down a concourse with a slowness that is infuriating to his fellow travelers. They have all spent the last half-day strapped into bad chairs, stuffed into an aluminum tube aslosh with jet fuel. Over the safety-engineered nubs molded into the jetway floor, their rolling suitcases drone like fighter planes. They graze the backs of his knees as they bank around his husky columnar body. Randy is holding his new GSM phone to the side of his head. Supposedly it works anywhere in the world, except for the United States. This is his first chance to try it out.

``You sound clear as a bell,'' Avi says. ``How was the flight over?''

``All right,'' Randy says. ``They had one of those animated maps up on the video screen.''

Avi sighs. ``All the airlines have those now,'' he announces monotonically.

``The only feature between San Francisco and Tokyo was Midway Island.''

``So?''

``It kind of hung there for hours. MIDWAY. Mute embarrassment all around.''

Randy reaches the departure gate for Manila, and pauses to admire a five-foot-wide high-definition TV set bearing the logo of a major Nipponese consumer-electronics company. It is running a video in which a wacky cartoon professor and his adorable canine sidekick cheerfully tick off the three transmission routes of the AIDS virus.

``I have a fingerprint for you,'' Randy says.

``Shoot.''

Randy stares at the palm of his hand, on which he has written a string of numbers and letters in ballpoint pen. ``AF 10 06 E9 99 BA 11 07 64 C1 89 E3 40 8C 72 55.''

``Got it,'' Avi says. ``That's from Ordo, right?''

``Right. I e-mailed you the key from SFO.''

``The apartment situation is still resolving,'' Avi says. ``So I just reserved you a suite at the Manila Hotel.''

``What do you mean, it's still resolving?''

``The Philippines is one of those post-Spanish countries with no clear boundaries between business and personal relationships,'' Avi says. ``I don't think you can secure lodgings there without marrying into a family with a major street named after it.''

Randy takes a seat in the departure area. Perky gate attendants in jaunty, improbable hats zero in on Filipinos with too many carry-ons, and subject them to a public ritual of filling out little tags and surrendering their possessions. The Filipinos roll their eyes and stare longingly out the windows. But most of the waiting passengers are Nipponese--some businessmen, mostly vacationers. They are watching an educational video about how to get mugged in foreign countries.

``Huh,'' Randy says, looking out the window, ``got another 747 down to Manila.''

``In Asia, no decent airline bothers to dick around anything smaller than a 747,'' Avi snaps. ``If someone tries to pack you on board a 737 or god forbid an Airbus, run, don't walk, away from the boarding lounge, and call me on my Sky Pager and I'll send in a chopper to evacuate you.''

Randy laughs.

Avi continues. ``Now, listen. This hotel you're going to is very old, very grand, but it's in the middle of nowhere.''

``Why would they build a grand hotel in the middle of nowhere?''

``It used to be a happening place--it's on the waterfront, right on the edge of Intramuros.''

Randy's high-school Spanish is enough to translate that: Inside the Walls.

``But Intramuros was annihilated by the Nipponese in 1945,'' Avi continues. ``Systematically. All of the business hotels and office buildings are in a new neighborhood called Makati, much closer to the airport.''

``So you want to put our office in Intramuros.''

``How'd you guess?'' Avi says, sounding a little spooked. He prides himself on unpredictability.

``I'm not an intuitive guy generally,'' Randy says, ``but I've been on a plane for thirteen hours and my brain has been turned inside out and hung up to dry.''

Avi rattles off canned justifications: office space is much cheaper in Intramuros. Government ministries are closer. Makati, the gleaming new business district, is too isolated from the real Philippines. Randy pays no attention to it.

``You want to work out of Intramuros because it was systematically annihilated, and because you're obsessed with the Holocaust,'' Randy finally says, quietly and without rancor.

``Yeah. So?'' Avi says.

Randy stares out the window of the Manila-bound 747, sipping on a fluorescent green Nipponese soft drink made from bee extracts (at least, it has pictures of bees on it) and munching on something that a flight attendant handed him called Japanese Snack. Sky and ocean are the same color, a shade of blue that makes his teeth freeze. The plane is so high that, whether he looks up or down, he sees foreshortened views of boiling cumulonimbus stacks. The clouds erupt from the hot Pacific as if immense warships were exploding all over the place. The speed and power of their growth is alarming, the forms they adopt as bizarre and varied as those of deep-sea organisms, and all of them, he supposes, are as dangerous to an airplane as punji stakes to a barefoot pedestrian. The red-orange meatball painted on the wingtip startles him when he notices it. He feels like he's been thrown into an old war film.

He turns on his laptop. Electronic mail from Avi, encrypted to a fare-thee-well, has been piling up in his in-box. It is a gradual accumulation of tiny files, thrown at him by Avi whenever a thought popped into his head over the last three days; it would be obvious, even if Randy didn't know it, that Avi owns a portable e-mail machine that talks to the Internet by radio. Randy fires up a piece of software that is technically called Novus Ordo Seclorum but that everyone calls Ordo for short. It is a fairly strained pun based on the fact that Ordo's job, as a piece of cryptographic software, is to put a message's bits in a New Order and that it will take Centuries for nosy governments to decrypt it. A scanned image of a Great Pyramid appears in the middle of his screen, and a single eye gradually materializes at its apex.

Ordo can handle this in one of two ways. The obvious way is to decrypt all of the messages and convert them into plaintext files on his hard disk, which he can then read any time he wants. The problem with this (if you are paranoid) is that anyone who gets his hands on Randy's hard disk can then read the files. For all he knows, the customs officials in Manila will decide to ransack his computer for child pornography. Or, fogged by jet lag, he'll leave his laptop in a taxi. So instead he puts Ordo into a streaming mode where it will decrypt the files just long enough for him to read them and then, when he closes the windows, expunge the plaintext from the computer's memory and from its hard drive.

The subject heading of Avi's first message is: ``Guideline 1.''

We look for places where the math is right. Meaning what? Meaning that pop. is about to explode---we can predict that just by looking at age histogram---and per capita income is about to take off the way it did in Nippon, Taiwan, Singapore. Multiply those two things together and you get the kind of exponential growth that should get us all into fuck-you money before we turn forty.

This is an allusion to a Randy/Avi conversation of two years ago wherein Avi actually calculated a specific numerical value for ``fuck-you money.'' It was not a fixed constant, however, but rather a cell in a spreadsheet linked to any number of continually fluctuating economic indicators. Sometimes when Avi is working at his computer he will leave the spreadsheet running in a tiny window in the corner so that he can see the current value of ``fuck-you money'' at a glance.

The second message, sent a couple of hours later, is called ``Guideline 2.''

Two: pick a tech where no one can compete with us. Right now, that=networking. We're kicking the crap out of everyone else in the world when it comes to networking. It's not even funny.

The next day, Avi sent a message called, simply, ``More.'' Perhaps he had lost track of the number of guidelines he'd issued so far.

Another principle: this time we retain control of the corporation. That means that we keep at least fifty percent of the shares---which means little to no outside investment until we've built up some value.

``You don't have to convince me,'' Randy mumbles to himself, as he reads this.

This shapes the kinds of businesses we can get into. Forget anything that requires a big initial investment.

Luzon is green-black jungle mountains gouged with rivers that would appear to be avalanches of silt. As the navy-blue ocean verges on its khaki beaches, the water takes on the shocking iridescent hue of a suburban swimming pool. Farther south, the mountains are swidden-scarred--the soil beneath is bright red and so these parts look like fresh lacerations. But most is covered with foliage that looks like the nubby green stuff that model railroaders put over their papier-mache hills, and in vast stretches of the mountains there are no signs whatsoever that human beings have ever existed. Closer to Manila, some of the slopes are deforested, sprinkled with structures, ribboned with power-line cuts. Rice paddies line the basins. The towns are accretions of shanties, nucleated around large cross-shaped churches with good roofs.

The view gets blurry as they belly down into the pall of sweaty smog above the city. The plane begins to sweat like a giant glass of iced tea. The water streams off in sheets, collects in crevices, whips off the flaps' trailing edges.

Suddenly they are banking over Manila Bay, which is marked with endless streaks of brilliant red--some kind of algal bloom. Oil tankers trail long time-delayed rainbows that flourish in their wakes. Every cove is jammed with long skinny boats with dual outriggers, looking like brightly painted water skaters.

And then they are down on the runway at NAIA, Ninoy Aquino International Airport. Guards and cops of various stripes are ambling around with M-16s or pistol-handled pump shotguns, wearing burnooses fashioned from handkerchiefs clamped to the head with American baseball caps. A man dressed in a radiant white uniform stands below the ragged maw of the jetway holding his hands downwards with fluorescent orange sticks in them, like Christ dispensing mercy on a world of sinners. Sulfurous, fulminating tropical air begins to leak in through the jumbo's air vents. Everything moistens and wilts.

He is in Manila. He takes his passport out of his shirt pocket. It says, RANDALL LAWRENCE WATERHOUSE.



This is how Epiphyte Corporation came into existence:

``I am channeling the bad shit!'' Avi said.

The number came through on Randy's pager while he was sitting around a table in a grubhouse along the coast with his girlfriend's crowd. A place where, every day, they laser-printed fresh menus on 100% recycled imitation parchment, where oscilloscope tracings of neon-colored sauces scribbled across the plates, and the entrees were towering, architectonic stacks of rare ingredients carved into gemlike prisms. Randy had spent the entire meal trying to resist the temptation to invite one of Charlene's friends (any one of them, it didn't matter) out on the sidewalk for a fistfight.

He glanced at his pager expecting to see the number of the Three Siblings Computer Center, which was where he worked (technically, still does). The fell digits of Avi's phone number penetrated the core of his being in the same way that 666 would a fundamentalist's.

Fifteen seconds later, Randy was out on the sidewalk, swiping his card through a pay phone like an assassin drawing a single-edged razor blade across the throat of a tubby politician.

``The power is coming down from On High,'' Avi continued. ``Tonight, it happens to be coming through me--you poor bastard.''

``What do you want me to do?'' Randy asked, adopting a cold, almost hostile tone to mask sick excitement.

``Buy a ticket to Manila,'' Avi said.

``I have to talk it over with Charlene first,'' Randy said.

``You don't even believe that yourself,'' Avi said.

``Charlene and I have a long-standing relationsh--''

``It's been ten years. You haven't married her. Fill in the fucking blanks.''

(Seventy-two hours later, he would be in Manila, looking at the One-Note Flute.)

``Everyone in Asia is wondering when the Philippines is finally going to get its shit together,'' Avi said, ``it's the question of the nineties.''

(The One-Note Flute is the first thing you see when you make it through passport control.)

``I flashed on this when I was standing in line at Passport Control at Ninoy Aquino International Airport,'' Avi said, compressing that entire name into a single, sharply articulated burst. ``You know how they have different lanes?''

``I guess so,'' Randy said. A parallelpiped of seared tuna did a barrel roll in his gullet. He felt a perverse craving for a double ice-cream cone. He did not travel as much as Avi, and had only a vague idea of what he meant by lanes.

``You know. One lane for citizens. One for foreigners. Maybe one for diplomats.''

(Now, standing there waiting to have his passport stamped, Randy can see it clearly. For once he doesn't mind the wait. He gets in a lane next to the OCW lane and studies them. They are Epiphyte Corp.'s market. Mostly young women, many of them fashionably dressed, but still with a kind of Catholic boarding-school demureness. Exhausted from long flights, tired of the wait, they slump, then suddenly straighten up and elevate their fine chins, as if an invisible nun were making her way up the line whacking their manicured knuckles with a ruler.)

But seventy-two hours ago he hadn't really understood what Avi meant by lanes, so he just said, ``Yeah, I've seen the lane thing.''

``At Manila, they have a whole lane just for returning OCWs!''

``OCWs?''

``Overseas Contract Workers. Filipinos working abroad--because the economy of the Philippines is so lame. As maids and nannies in Saudi. Nurses and anesthesiologists in the States. Singers in Hong Kong, whores in Bangkok.''

``Whores in Bangkok?'' Randy had been there, at least, and his mind reeled at the concept of importing prostitutes to Thailand.

``The Filipino women are more beautiful,'' Avi said quietly, ``and have a ferocity that makes them more interesting, to the innately masochistic business traveler, than all those grinning Thai bimbos.'' Both of them knew that this was complete bullshit; Avi was a family man and had no firsthand experience whereof he spoke. Randy didn't call him on it, though. As long as Avi retained this extemporaneous bullshitting ability there was a better than even chance of all of them making fuck-you money.

(Now that he's here, it is tempting to speculate as to which of the girls in the OCW lane are hustlers. But he can't see that going anywhere but wrong, so he squares his shoulders and marches toward the yellow line.

The government has set up glass display cases in the concourse leading from passport control to the security barrier. The cases contain artifacts demonstrating the glories of pre-Magellan Filipino culture. The first one of these contains the piece de resistance: a rustic hand-carved musical instrument labeled with a long and unreadable name in Tagalog. Underneath that, in smaller letters, is the English translation: ONE-NOTE FLUTE.)

``See? The Philippines is innately hedged,'' Avi said. ``You know how rare that is? When you find an innately hedged environment, Randy, you lunge into it like a rabid ferret going into a pipe full of raw meat.''

A word about Avi: his father's people had just barely gotten out of Prague. As Central European Jews went, they were fairly typical. The only thing about them that was really anomalous was that they were still alive. But his mother's people were unbelievably peculiar New Mexican crypto-Jews who had been living on mesas, dodging Jesuits, shooting rattlesnakes and eating jimson weed for three hundred years; they looked like Indians and talked like cowboys. In his relations with other people, therefore, Avi dithered. Most of the time he was courtly and correct in a way that was deeply impressive to businesspeople--Nipponese ones expecially--but there were these eruptions, from time to time, as if he'd been dipping into the loco weed. Randy had learned to deal with it, which is why Avi called him at times like this.

``Oh, calm down!'' Randy said. He watched a tanned girl rollerblade past him, on her way up from the beach. ``Innately hedged?''

``As long as the Philippines don't have their shit together, there'll be plenty of OCWs. They will want to communicate with their families--the Filipinos are incredibly family-oriented. They make Jews look like a bunch of alienated loners.''

``Okay. You know more about both groups than I do.''

``They are sentimental and affectionate in a way that's very easy for us to sneer at.''

``You don't have to be defensive,'' Randy said, ``I'm not sneering at them.''

``When you hear their song dedications on the radio, you'll sneer,'' Avi said. ``But frankly, we could take some pointers from the Pinoys on this front.''

``You are so close to being sanctimonious right now--''

``I apologize,'' Avi said, with absolute sincerity. Avi's wife had been pregnant almost continuously for the four years they'd been married. He was getting more religiously observant daily and couldn't make it through a conversation without mentioning the Holocaust. Randy was a bachelor who was just about to break up with the chick he'd been living with.

``I believe you, Avi,'' Randy said. ``Is it a problem with you if I buy a business-class ticket?''

Avi didn't hear him, so Randy assumed that meant yes. ``As long as that's the case, there will be a big market for Pinoy-grams.''

``Pinoy-grams?''

``For god's sake, don't say it out loud! I'm filling out the trademark application as we speak,'' Avi said. Randy could hear a rattling sound in the background, computer keys impacting so rapidly it sounded like Avi was simply holding the keyboard between his pale, spindly hands and shaking it violently up and down. ``But if the Filipinos do get their shit together, then we see explosive growth in telecoms, as in any other Arday.''

``Arday?''

``R-D-A-E. Rapidly Developing Asian Economy. Either way, we win.''

``I gather you want to do something with telecoms?''

``Bingo.'' In the background, a baby began to cough and cry. ``Gotta go,'' Avi said, ``Shlomo's asthma is spiking again. Take down this fingerprint.''

``Fingerprint?''

``For my encryption key. For e-mail.''

``Ordo?''

``Yeah.''

Randy took out a ballpoint pen and, finding no paper in his pocket, poised it over the palm of his hand. ``Shoot.''

``67 81 A4 AE FF 40 25 9B 43 0E 29 8D 56 60 E3 2F.'' Then Avi hung up the phone.

Randy went back into the restaurant. On his way back, he asked the waiter to bring him a half-bottle of good red wine. Charlene heard him, and glowered. Randy was still thinking about innate ferocity, and did not see it in her face; only a schoolmarmishness common among all of her friends. My god! I have to get out of California, he realized.


SEAWEED

Woman holds baby

Eyes pale as a muzzle flash

Band chimes frozen tears

The fourth marines is marching downhill to the strains of John Philip Sousa, which ought to be second nature to a Marine. But the Fourth Marines have been in Shanghai (which ain't no halls of Montezuma nor shores of Tripoli) for too long, longer than Marines should ever stay in one place, and Bobby's already seen his sergeant, one Frick, throw up from opium withdrawal.

A Marine band is several Shanghai blocks ahead. Bobby's platoon can hear the thumpity-thump of the big drums and the piercing noises from piccolos and glockenspiels but he can't follow the tune. Corporal Shaftoe is effectively their leader, because Sergeant Frick is useless.

Shaftoe marches alongside the formation, supposedly to keep an eye on his men, but mostly he's just staring at Shanghai.

Shanghai stares back, and mostly gives them a standing ovation. Of course there is a type of young street rowdy who makes it a point of honor to let the Marines know he isn't scared of them, and they are jeering the Marines from a safe distance, and setting off strings of firecrackers, which does nothing to steady anyone's nerves. The Europeans are applauding--a whole chorus line of Russian dancing girls from Delmonte's is showing thigh and blowing kisses. But most of the Chinese look pretty stonefaced, which--Bobby suspects--means they're scared shitless.

The worst thing is the women carrying half-white babies. A few of these women are rabid, hysterical, throwing themselves into formations of massed Marines, undeterred by rifle butts. But most of them are stoic: they stand with their light-eyed babies and glare, searching the ranks and files for the guilty party. They've all heard about what happened upriver in Nanjing when the Nips came there, and they know that when it's all over, the only trace that they and their babies ever existed may be a really bad memory in the mind of some American Marine.

It works for Shaftoe: he has hunted deer in Wisconsin and seen them limping across the snow, bleeding to death. He saw a man die in basic training at Parris Island. He has seen whole tangles of bodies in the Yangtze, downstream of where the Nipponese were prosecuting the China Incident, and he has seen refugees from places like Nanjing starve to death in the gutters of Shanghai. He has himself killed people who were trying to storm the riverboats it was his duty to protect. He thinks that he has never seen, and will never see, anything as terrible as those stone-faced Chinese women holding their white babies, not even blinking as the firecrackers explode all around them.

Until, that is, he looks into the faces of certain Marines who stare into that crowd and see their own faces looking back at them, pudgy with baby fat and streaked with tears. Some of them seem to think it's all a joke. But many of the Marines who march out of their empty barracks that morning sane and solid men, have, by the time they reach the gunboats waiting for them at the Bund, gone mad. They don't show it. But Shaftoe can see in their eyes that something has given way inside.

The very best men in the regiment are in a foul mood. The ones like Shaftoe, who didn't get involved with the Chinese women, are still leaving plenty behind: houses with maids and shoeshine boys and coolies, with women and opium for almost nothing. They don't know where they are being shipped off to, but it's safe to say that their twenty-one dollars a month won't go as far. They'll be in barracks and they'll have to learn to polish their own boots again. When the gangplanks are drawn in from the stone edge of the Bund, they are cut off from a whole world that they'll never see again, a world where they were kings. Now they are Marines again. It's okay with Shaftoe, who wants to be a Marine. But many of the men have become middle-aged here, and don't.

The guilty men duck belowdecks. Shaftoe remains on the deck of the gunboat, which casts off from the Bund, headed for the cruiser Augusta, which awaits in mid-channel.

The Bund is jammed with onlookers in a riot of differently colored clothing, so one patch of uniform drab catches his eye: a group of Nip soldiers who've come down to bid their Yank counterparts a sarcastic farewell. Shaftoe scans the group looking for someone tall and bulky, and picks him out easily. Goto Dengo's waving to him.

Shaftoe takes his helmet off and waves back. Then, on impulse, just for the hell of it, he winds up and flings the helmet directly at Goto Dengo's head. The throw goes awry and Goto Dengo has to knock down about a dozen of his comrades in order to catch it. All of them seem to think that it is a high honor, as well as tremendously amusing, to be knocked down by Goto Dengo.

Twenty seconds later, a comet sails up out of the flesh cosmos of the Bund and bounces on the wooden deck of the gunboat--a hell of a throw. Goto Dengo is showing off his follow-through. The projectile is a rock with a white streamer wrapped around it. Shaftoe runs over and snatches it. The streamer is one of those thousand-stitch headbands (supposedly; he's taken a few off of unconscious Nips, but he's never bothered to count the stitches) that they tie around their heads as a good-luck charm; it has a meatball in the center and some Nip writing to either side. He unties it from around the rock. In so doing he realizes, suddenly, that it's not a rock after all; it is a hand grenade! But good old Goto Dengo was just joking--he didn't pull the pin. A nice souvenir for Bobby Shaftoe.

Shaftoe's first haiku (December 1940) was a quick and dirty adaptation of the Marine Creed:

This is my rifle

There are many like it but

This rifle is mine.

He wrote it under the following circumstances: Shaftoe and the rest of Fourth Marines were stationed in Shanghai so that they could guard the International Settlement and work as muscle on the gunboats of the Yangtze River Patrol. His platoon had just come back from the Last Patrol: a thousand-mile reconnaissance-in-force all the way up past what was left of Nanjing, to Hankow, and back. Marines had been doing this ever since the Boxer Rebellion, through civil wars and everything else. But towards the end of 1940, what with the Nips basically running all of northeast China now, the politicians back in D.C. had finally thrown in the towel and told the China Marines not to steam up the Yangtze any more.

Now, the Old Breed Marines like Frick claimed they could tell the difference between organized brigands; armed mobs of starving peasants; rogue Nationalists; Communist guerrillas; and the irregular forces in the pay of warlords. But to Bobby Shaftoe they were all just crazy, armed slopes who wanted a piece of the Yangtze River Patrol. The Last Patrol had been a wild trip. But it was over and they were back in Shanghai now, the safest place you could be in China, and about a hundred times more dangerous than the most dangerous place you could be in America. They had climbed off the gunboat six hours ago, gone to a bar, and not come out until just now, when they had decided it was high time they went to a whorehouse. On their way, they happened to pass this Nip restaurant.

Bobby Shaftoe had looked in the windows of the place before, and watched the man with the knife, trying to figure out what the hell he was doing. It looked a hell of a lot like he was cutting up uncooked fish and putting the raw meat on bullets of rice and handing it over to the Nips on the other side of the counter, who were wolfing it down.

It had to be some kind of optical illusion. The fish must have been precooked in the back room.

This had been nagging at Shaftoe for about a year. As he and the other horny drunk Marines went by the place, he slowed down to peer through the window, trying to gather more evidence. He could swear that some of that fish looked ruby red, which it wouldn't have been if it were cooked.

One of his buddies, Rhodes from Shreveport, noticed him looking. He dared Shaftoe to go in there and sit down at that bar. Then another private, Gowicki from Pittsburgh, double-dared him!

Shaftoe sucked his teeth and considered the matter. He had already made up his mind that he was going to do it. He was a sniper scout, and it was in his nature to do crazy shit like this; but it was also part of his training to scan the terrain carefully before venturing in.

The restaurant was three-quarters full, and everyone in the place was a uniformed member of the Nipponese military. At the bar where the man was cutting up the apparently raw fish, there was a marked concentration of officers; if you only had one grenade, that's where you'd throw it. Most of the place was filled with long tables where enlisted men sat, drinking noodle soup from steaming urns. Shaftoe paid particular attention to these, because they were the ones who were going to be beating the shit out of him in about sixty seconds. Some were there alone, with reading material. A cluster of them, back in one corner, were paying attention to one fellow who was apparently telling a joke or story.

The longer Shaftoe spent reconnoitering the place, the more convinced Rhodes and Gowicki became that he was actually going to do it. They became excited and called for the other Marines, who had gone ahead of them down the block, headed for that whorehouse.

Shaftoe saw the others coming back--his tactical reserve. ``What the fuck,'' he said, and went into the restaurant. Behind him, he could hear the others shouting excitedly; they couldn't believe he was doing it. When Shaftoe stepped over the threshold of that Nip restaurant, he passed into the realm of legend.

All the Nips looked up at him when he came in the door. If they were surprised, they didn't show it. The chef behind the counter began to holler out some kind of ritual greeting, which faltered and trailed off as he got a look at what had just come in. The fellow in the back of the room--a husky, pink-cheeked Nip--continued telling his joke or story or whatever it was.

Shaftoe nodded to no one in particular, then stepped to the nearest empty chair at the bar and sat down.

Other Marines would have waited until the whole squad had assembled. Then they would have invaded the restaurant en masse, knocked over a few chairs, spilled some soup. But Shaftoe had seized the initiative before the others could do any such thing and gone in by himself, as a sniper scout was supposed to do. It was not just because he was a sniper scout, though. It was also because he was Bobby Shaftoe, and he was sincerely curious about this place, and if he could, he wanted to spend a few calm minutes in here and learn a few things about it before the fun started.

It helped, of course, that Shaftoe was a quiet and contemplative drunk, not a dangerous explosive drunk. He must have reeked of beer (those Krauts in Tsingtao cranked out a brew whose taste took him right back to Wisconsin, and he was homesick). But he wasn't hollering or knocking things over.

The chef was busy crafting one of his little morsels and pretended to ignore Shaftoe. The other men at the counter stared coldly at Shaftoe for a while, then turned their attentions back to their food. Shaftoe looked at the array of raw fish laid out on shaved ice behind the bar, then looked around the room. The guy back in the corner was talking in short bursts, reading from a notebook. He would speak maybe ten or twenty words, and then his little audience would turn to one another and grin, or grimace, or sometimes even make a patter of applause. He wasn't delivering his material like a dirty joke. He spoke precisely and expressively.

Fuck! He was reading poetry! Shaftoe had no idea what he was saying, but he could tell, by the sound of it, that it must be poetry. Didn't rhyme though. But the Nips did everything queerly.

He noticed that the chef was glaring at him. He cleared his throat, which was useless since he couldn't speak Nip. He looked at some of that ruby red fish behind the bar, pointed to it, held up two fingers.

Everyone was startled that the American had actually placed an order. The tension was broken, only a little. The chef went to work and produced two morsels, which he served up on a wooden pedestal.

Shaftoe had been trained to eat insects, and to bite the heads off chickens, so he figured he could handle this. He picked the morsels up in his fingers, just like the Nips were doing, and ate them. They were good. He ordered two more, of another variety. The guy in the corner kept reading poetry. Shaftoe ate his morsels and then ordered some more. For perhaps ten seconds, between the taste of the fish and the sound of the poetry, he actually felt comfortable here, and forgot that he was merely instigating a vicious racial brawl.

The third order looked different: laid over the top of the raw fish were thin translucent sheets of some kind of moist, glistening material. It looked sort of like butcher paper soaked in oil. Shaftoe gawked at it for a while, trying to identify it, but it looked like no foodstuff he knew of. He glanced left and right, hoping that one of the Nips had ordered the same stuff, so that he could watch and learn the right way to eat it. No luck.

Hell, they were officers. Maybe one of them spoke a little English. `` 'Scuse me. What's this?'' Shaftoe said, peeling up one corner of the eerie membrane.

The chef looked up at him nervously, then scanned the bar, polling the customers. Discussion ensued. Finally, a Nip officer at the end of the bar, a naval lieutenant, stood up and spoke to Bobby Shaftoe.

``Seaweed.''

Shaftoe did not particularly like the lieutenant's tone of voice--hostile and sullen. This, combined with the look on his face, seemed to say, You'll never understand it, you farmer, so why don't you just think of it as seaweed.

Shaftoe folded his hands primly in his lap, regarded the seaweed for a few moments, and then looked up at the lieutenant, who was still gazing at him expressionlessly. ``What kind of seaweed, sir?'' he said.

Significant glances began flying around the restaurant, like semaphores before a naval engagement. The poetry reading seemed to have stopped, and a migration of enlisted men had begun from the back of the room. Meanwhile the lieutenant translated Shaftoe's inquiry to the others, who discussed it in some detail, as if it were a major policy initiative from Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

The lieutenant and the chef exchanged words. Then the lieutenant looked at Shaftoe again. ``He say, you pay now.'' The chef held up one hand and rubbed his fingers and thumb together.

A year of working the Yangtze River Patrol had given Bobby Shaftoe nerves of titanium, and unlimited faith in his comrades, and so he resisted the impulse to turn his head and look out the window. He already knew exactly what he would see: Marines, shoulder to shoulder, ready to die for him. He scratched the new tattoo on his forearm: a dragon. His dirty fingernails, passing over the fresh scabs, made a rasping sound in the utterly silent restaurant.

``You didn't answer my question,'' Shaftoe said, pronouncing the words with a drunk's precision.

The lieutenant translated this into Nipponese. More discussion. But this time it was curt and decisive. Shaftoe could tell that they were about to bounce him. He squared his shoulders.

The Nips were good; they mounted an organized charge out the door, onto the sidewalk, and engaged the Marines, before anyone actually laid a hand on Shaftoe. This spoiling attack prevented the Marines from invading the restaurant proper, which would have disturbed the officers' meal and, with any luck, led to untold property damage. Shaftoe then felt himself being grabbed from behind by at least three people and hoisted into the air. He made eye contact with the lieutenant while this was happening, and shouted: ``Are you bullshitting me about the seaweed?''

As brawls went, the only remarkable part of this one was the way he was carried out to the street before he could actually get started. Then it was like all the other street fights he'd been in with Nip soldiers in Shanghai. These all came down to American brawn (you didn't get picked for the Fourth Regiment unless you were an impressive-looking six-footer) versus that Nipponese chop-socky.

Shaftoe wasn't a boxer. He was a wrestler. This was to his advantage. The other Marines would put up their dukes and try to fight it out--Marquis of Queensberry style--no match for chop-socky. Shaftoe had no illusions about his boxing, so he would just put his head down and charge like a bull, take a few blows to the face on his way in, but usually get a solid hold on his opponent and slam him into the cobblestones. Usually that shook the Nip up enough that Shaftoe could get him in a full-nelson or a hammerlock and get him to cry uncle.

The guys who were carrying him out of the restaurant got jumped by Marines as soon as they were in the open. Shaftoe found himself going up against an opponent who was at least as tall as he was, which was unusual. This one had a solid build, too. Not like a sumo wrestler. More like a football player--a lineman, with a bit of a gut. He was a strong S.O.B. and Shaftoe knew right away that he was in for a real scrape. The guy had a different style of wrestling from the American, which (as Shaftoe learned the hard way) included some illegal maneuvers: partial strangulation and powerful, short punches to major nerve centers. The gulf between Shaftoe's mind and body, already wedged open by alcohol, was yanked open to a chasm by these techniques. He ended up lying on the sidewalk, helpless and paralyzed, staring up into the chubby face of his opponent. This was (he realized) the same guy who'd been sitting in the corner of the restaurant reading poetry. He was a good wrestler for a poet. Or maybe vice versa.

``It is not seaweed,'' said the big Nip. He had a look on his face like a naughty schoolkid getting away with something. ``The English word is maybe calabash?'' Then he turned and walked back into the restaurant.

So much for legend. What none of the other Marines knows is that this was not the last encounter between Bobby Shaftoe and Goto Dengo. The incident left Shaftoe with any number of nagging questions about subjects as diverse as seaweed, poetry, and chop-socky. He sought out Goto Dengo after that, which was not that hard--he just paid some Chinese boys to follow the conspicuous Nip around town and file daily reports. From this he learned that Goto Dengo and some of his comrades gathered every morning in a certain park to practice their chop-socky. After making sure that his will was in order and writing a last letter to his parents and siblings in Oconomowoc, Shaftoe went to that park one morning, reintroduced himself to the surprised Goto Dengo, and made arrangements to serve as human punching bag. They found his self-defense skills hilariously primitive but admired his resilience, and so, for the small cost of a few broken ribs and digits, Bobby Shaftoe got a preliminary course in the particular type of chop-socky favored by Goto Dengo, which is called judo. Over time, this even led to a few social engagements in bars, and restaurants, where Shaftoe learned to recognize four types of seaweed, three types of fish eggs, and several flavors of Nip poetry. Of course he had no idea what the fuck they were saying, but he could count syllables, which, as far as he could tell, is about all there is to Nip poetry appreciation.

Not that this--or any other knowledge of their culture--is going to do him any good now that it will soon be his job to kill them.

In return, Shaftoe taught Goto Dengo how not to throw like a girl. A lot of the Nips are good at baseball and so it was hilarious, even to them, to see their burly friend pushing ineffectually at a baseball. But it was Shaftoe who taught Goto Dengo to stand sideways, to rotate his shoulders, and to follow through. He's paid a lot of attention to the big Nip's throwing form during the last year, and maybe that's why the image of Goto Dengo planting his feet on the ashlars of the Bund, winding up, throwing the streamer-wrapped grenade, and following through almost daintily on one combat-booted foot stays in Shaftoe's mind all the way to Manila and beyond.



A couple of days into the voyage it becomes apparent that Sergeant Frick has forgotten how to shine his boots. Every night he puts them on the deck beside his bunk, like he's expecting a coolie to come around and shine them up during the night. Every morning he wakes up and finds them in a sorrier state than before. After a few days he starts to draw reprimands from On High, starts to get a lot of potato-peeling duty.

Now in and of itself this is forgivable. Frick started out his career chasing bandolier-draped desperadoes away from mail trains on the High Chaparral, for God's sake. In '27 he got shipped off to Shanghai on very short notice, and no doubt had to display some adaptability. Fine. And now he's on this miserable pre-Great War cruiser and it's a little hard on him. Fine. But he does not take all of this with the dignity that is demanded of Marines by Marines. He whines about it. He lets himself get humiliated. He gets angry. A lot of the other old China Marines see things his way.

One day Bobby Shaftoe is up on the deck of the destroyer tossing the old horsehide around with a couple of the other young Marines when he sees a few of these older guys accumulating into a sort of human booger on the afterdeck. He can tell by the looks on their faces and by their gestures that they are bellyaching.

Shaftoe hears a couple of the ship's crew talking to each other nearby. ``What the hell is wrong with those Marines?'' one of them says. The other one shakes his head sadly, like a doctor who has just seen a patient's eyeballs roll up into their sockets. ``Those poor bastards have gone Asiatic,'' he says.

And then they turn and look at Shaftoe.

That evening, at mess, Bobby Shaftoe gulps his food down double-time, then stands up and approaches the table where those Old Breed Marines are sullenly gathered. ``Begging your pardon, Sergeant!'' he hollers. ``Request permission to shine your boots, Sarge!''

Frick's mouth drops open, revealing a half-chewed plug of boiled beef. ``Whud you say, Corporal?''

The mess has gone silent. ``Respectfully request permission to shine your boots, Sarge!''

Frick is not the quickest guy in the world even when he's sober, and it's pretty obvious, just from looking at his pupils, that he and his comrades have brought some opium aboard. ``Wull, uh, I guess so,'' he says. He looks around at his crew of gripers, who are a little confused and a little amused. He unlaces his boots. Bobby Shaftoe takes those disgraceful things away and returns a bit later with them resplendently shined. By this time, Frick has gotten high and mighty. ``Wull, those boots look real good, Corporal Shaftoe,'' he says in a brassy voice. ``Darned if you ain't as good a shoe-shiner as my coolie boy was.''

At lights out, Frick and crew are short-sheeted. Various other, ruder practical jokes ensue during the nighttime. One of them gets jumped in his bunk and beaten by unspecified attackers. The brass call a surprise inspection the next morning and cuss them out. The ``gone Asiatic'' crew spend most of the next day gathered in a cluster, watching each other's backs.

Around midday, Frick finally gets it through his head that all of this was triggered by Shaftoe's gesture, and that Shaftoe knew, all along, what was going to happen. So he rushes Bobby Shaftoe up on the deck and tries to throw him over the rail.

Shaftoe's warned at the last minute by one of his compadres, and spins around just enough to throw off Frick's attack. Frick caroms off the rail, turns around, and tries to grab Shaftoe's nuts. Shaftoe pokes him in the eye, which straightens him right up. They back away from each other. The opening formalities having been finished; they put up their dukes.

Frick and Shaftoe box for a couple of rounds. A large crowd of Marines gathers. On most of their cards, Frick is winning the fight. Frick was always dim-witted, and is now crazy to boot, but he knows his way around a boxing ring, and he has forty pounds on Shaftoe.

Shaftoe puts up with it until Frick socks him pretty hard in the mouth and gives him a bloody lip.

``How far are we from Manila?'' Shaftoe hollers. This question, as usual, leaves Sergeant Frick confused and bewildered, and straightens him up for a moment.

``Two days,'' answers one of the ship's officers.

``Well, goddamn,'' Bobby Shaftoe says. ``How'm I gonna kiss my girl with this fat lip?''

Frick answers, ``Just go out and find a cheaper one.''

That's all he needs. Shaftoe puts his head down and charges in on Frick, hollering like a Nip. Before Frick can get his brain in gear, Bobby Shaftoe has him wrapped up in one of those chop-socky holds that Goto Dengo taught him in Shanghai. He works his way up Frick's body to a choke-hold and then clamps down until Sergeant Frick's lips turn the color of the inside of an oyster shell. Then he hangs Frick over the rail, holding him upside-down by the ankles, until Frick recovers enough to shout, ``Uncle!''

A disciplinary proceeding is hastily called. Shaftoe is found guilty of being courteous (by shining Frick's boots) and defending the life of a Marine (himself) from a crazed attacker. The crazed attacker goes straight to the brig. Within a few hours, the noises Frick makes lets all of the Marines know what opium withdrawal feels like.

So Sergeant Frick does not get to see their entrance into Manila Bay. Shaftoe almost feels sorry for the poor bastard.

The island of Luzon lies to port all day long, a black hulk barely visible through the haze, with glimpses of palm trees and beaches down below. All of the Marines have been this way before and so they can pick out the Cordillera Central up north, and later the Zambales Mountains, which eventually plunge down to meet the sea near Subic Bay. Subic triggers a barrage of salty anecdotes. The ship does not put in there, but continues to swing southward around Bata'an, turning inland toward the entrance of Manila Bay. The ship reeks of shoe polish, talcum powder, and after-shave lotion; the Fourth Marines may have specialized in whoring and opium abuse, but they've always been known as the best-looking Marines in the Corps.

They pass by Corregidor. An island shaped like a bead of water on a waxed boot, it is gently rounded in the middle but steeply sloping into the water. It has a long, bony, dry tail that trails off at one end. The Marines know that the island is riddled with tunnels and bristling with terrible guns, but the only sign of these fortifications is the clusters of concrete barracks up in the hills, housing the men who serve the weapons. A tangle of antennas rises up above Topside. Their shapes are familiar to Shaftoe, because many of the same antennas rose above Station Alpha in Shanghai, and he had to take them apart and load them into the truck.

There is a giant limestone cliff descending nearly into the sea, and at the base of it is the entrance to the tunnel where all the spooks and radio men have their hideaway. Nearby is a dock, quite busy at the moment, with supplies being offloaded from civilian transports and stacked right there on the beach. This detail is noticed by all of the Marines as a positive sign of approaching war. Augusta drops anchor in the cove, and all of that tarp-wrapped radio stuff is unloaded into launches and taken to that dock, along with all of the odd pencil-necked Navy men who tended that gear in Shanghai.

The swell dies as they pass Corregidor and enter the bay. Greenish-brown algae floats in swirls and curlicues near the surface. Navy ships lay brown ropes of smoke across the still sea. Undisturbed by wind, these unfold into rugged shapes like translucent mountain ranges. They pass the big military base at Cavite--a sheet of land so low and flat that its boundary with the water would be invisible except for the picket line of palm trees. A few hangars and water towers rise from it, and low dark clusters of barracks farther inland. Manila is dead ahead of them, still veiled in haze. It is getting on toward evening.

Then the haze dissolves, the atmosphere suddenly becomes as limpid as a child's eyes, and for about an hour they can see to infinity. They are steaming into an arena of immense thunderheads with lightning corkscrewing down through them all around. Flat grey clouds like shards of broken slate peek out between anvils. Behind them are higher clouds vaulting halfway to the moon, glowing pink and salmon in the light of the setting sun. Behind that, more clouds nestled within banks of humidity like Christmas ornaments wrapped in tissue paper, expanses of blue sky, more thunderheads exchanging bolts of lightning twenty miles long. Skies nested within skies nested within skies.

It was cold up there in Shanghai, and it's gotten warmer every day since. Some days it's even been hot and muggy. But around the time Manila heaves into view, a warm breeze springs up over the deck and all of the Marines sigh, as if they have all ejaculated in unison.

Manila's perfume

Fanned by the coconut palms

The thighs of Glory

Manila's spreading tile roofs have a mestizo shape about them, half-Spanish and half-Chinese. The city has a concave seawall with a flat promenade on the top. Strollers turn and wave to the Marines; some of them blow kisses. A wedding party is gushing down the steps of a church and across the boulevard to the seawall, where they are getting their pictures taken in the flattering peach-colored light of the sunset. The men are in their fancy, gauzy Filipino shirts, or in U.S. military uniforms. The women are in spectacular gowns and dresses. The Marines holler and whistle at them and the women turn towards them, hitching up their skirts slightly so that they won't trip, and wave enthusiastically. The Marines get woozy and practically fall overboard.

As their ship is easing into its dock, a crescent-shaped formation of flying fish erupts from the water. It moves away like a dune being blown across the desert. The fish are silver and leaf-shaped. Each one strikes the water with a metallic click, and the clicks merge into a crisp ripping noise. The crescent glides beneath a pier, flowing around its pilings, and disappears in the shadows underneath.

Manila, the Pearl of the Orient, early on a Sunday evening, the 7th of December, 1941. In Hawaii, on the other side of the Date Line, it is only just past midnight. Bobby Shaftoe and his comrades have a few hours of freedom. The city is modern, prosperous, English-speaking, and Christian, by far the wealthiest and most advanced city in Asia, practically like being back home in the States. For all its Catholicity, it has areas that seem to have been designed, from the foundation-stones upwards, to the specifications of horny sailors. You get to those parts of town by turning right once your feet are on dry land.

Bobby Shaftoe turns left, politely excuses himself past a legion of excited prostitutes, and sets his course on the looming walls of Intramuros. He stops only to buy a sheaf of roses from a vendor in the park, who is doing land-office business. The park and the walls above it are crowded with strolling lovers, the men mostly in uniforms and the women in demure but stunning dresses, twirling parasols on their shoulders.

A couple of fellows driving horse-drawn taxis want to do business with Bobby Shaftoe but he turns them down. A taxi will only get him there faster, and he is too nervous to get there fast. He walks through a gate in the wall and into the old Spanish city.

Intramuros is a maze of buff-colored stone walls rising abruptly from narrow streets. The first-floor windows along the sidewalks are guarded by black ironwork cages. The bars swell, swirl, and sprout finedly hammered leaves. The second stories hang out overhead, sporting gas lights that are just now being lit by servants with long, smoking poles. The sound of laughter and music drifts out of the windows above, and when he passes by the archways that open into the inner courtyards, he can smell flowers back in the gardens.

Damned if he can tell these places apart. He remembers the street name of Magallanes, because Glory told him once it was the same thing as ``Magellan.'' And he remembers the view of the cathedral from the Pascuals' window. He wanders around a block a couple of times, certain that he is close. Then he hears an exaltation of girlish laughter coming from a second-story window, and moves toward it like a jellyfish sucked into an intake pipe. It all comes together. This is the place. The girls are all gossiping, in English, about one of their instructors. He does not hear Glory's voice but he thinks he hears her laughter.

``Glory!'' he says. Then he says it louder. If they hear him, they pay him no mind. Finally he winds up and flings the bouquet of roses like a potato-masher grenade over the wooden railing, through a narrow gap between the mother-of-pearl shutters, and into the room.

Miraculous silence from within the room, and then gales of laughter. The nacre shutters part with slow, agonizing coyness. A girl of nineteen steps out onto the balcony. She is dressed in the uniform of a nursing student. It is as white as starlight shining on the North Pole. She has let her long black hair down to brush it, and it stirs languidly in the evening breeze. The last ruddy light of the sunset makes her face glow like a coal. She hides behind the bouquet for a moment, buries her nose in it, inhales deeply, peeking out at him over the blossoms with her black eyes. Then she lowers the bouquet gradually to reveal her high cheeks, her perfect little nose, the fantastic sculpture of her lips, and teeth, white but fetchingly crooked, barely visible. She is smiling.

``Jesus H. Christ,'' Bobby Shaftoe says, ``your cheekbones are like a fucking snowplow.''

She puts her finger to her lips. The gesture of anything touching Glory's lips puts an invisible spear through Shaftoe's chest. She eyes him for a while, establishing, in her own mind, that she has the boy's attention and that he is not going anywhere. Then she turns her back on him. The light grazes her buttocks, showing nothing but suggesting cleavage. She goes back inside and the shutter glides shut behind her.

Suddenly the room full of girls becomes quiet, except for occasional ripples of suppressed laughter. Shaftoe bites his tongue. They are screwing it all up. Mr. or Mrs. Pascual will notice their silence and become suspicious.

Ironwork clangs and a big gate swings open. The porter beckons him inside. Shaftoe follows the old fellow down the black, arched tunnel of the porte-cochere. The hard soles of his shiny black shoes skid on the cobblestones. A horse back in the stable whinnies at the smell of his aftershave. Sleepy American music, slow-dance stuff from the Armed Forces station, spills tinnily from a radio in the porter's nook.

Flowering vines grow up the stone walls of the courtyard. It is a tidy, quiet, enclosed world, almost like being indoors. The porter waves him in the direction of one of the stairways that lead up to the second floor. Glory calls it the entresuelo and says that it's really a floor between the floors, but it looks like a full-fledged, regular floor to Bobby Shaftoe. He mounts the steps and looks up to see Mr. Pascual standing there, a tiny bald man with glasses and a trim little mustache. He is wearing a short-sleeved shirt, American style, and khaki trousers, and slippers, and is holding a glass of San Miguel in one hand and a cigarette in the other. ``Private Shaftoe! Welcome back,'' he says.

So. Glory has decided to play this one by the book. The Pascuals have been alerted. A few hours of socializing now stand between Bobby Shaftoe and his girl. But a Marine is never fazed by such setbacks.

``Begging your pardon, Mr. Pascual, but I am a corporal now.''

Mr. Pascual puts his cigarette in his mouth and shakes Corporal Shaftoe's hand. ``Well, congratulations! I just saw your uncle Jack last week. I don't think he had any idea you were on your way back.''

``It was a surprise to everyone, sir,'' Bobby Shaftoe says.

Now they are on a raised walkway that runs around the courtyard. Only livestock and servants live at ground level. Mr. Pascual leads them around to a door that takes them into the entresuelo. The walls here are rough stone, the ceilings are simple painted planks. They pass through a dark, somber office where Mr. Pascual's father and grandfather used to receive the managers of the family's haciendas and plantations. For a moment, Bobby Shaftoe gets his hopes up. This level has a few rooms that back in the old days were apartments for high-ranking servants, bachelor uncles, and spinster aunts. Now that the hacienda business ain't what it used to be, the Pascuals are renting them out to female students. Perhaps Mr. Pascual is leading him directly to Glory.

But this goes the way of all foolish, horny illusions as Shaftoe finds himself at the foot of a vast staircase of polished nara wood. He can see pressed-tin ceiling up there, chandeliers, and the imposing superstructure of Mrs. Pascual, contained within a mighty bodice that looks like something dreamed up by naval engineers. They ascend the stairs into the antesala, which according to Glory is strictly for casual, drop-in visitors but is fancier than any room Bobby Shaftoe has ever seen. There are big vases and pots all over the place, supposedly old, and supposedly from Japan and China. A fresh breeze runs through; he looks out a window and sees, neatly framed in it, the green dome of the cathedral with its Celtic cross on top, just as he remembered it. Mrs. Pascual holds out her hand and Shaftoe clasps it. ``Mrs. Pascual,'' he says, ``thank you for welcoming me into your home.''

``Please sit down,'' she says, ``we want to hear everything.''

Shaftoe sits in a fancy chair next to the piano, adjust his trousers a bit so that they will not cramp his erect penis, checks his shave. It probably has a few good hours left. A wing of airplanes drones overhead. Mrs. Pascual is giving instructions to the maid in Tagalog. Shaftoe examines the crusted lacerations on his knuckles and wonders whether Mrs. Pascual has the slightest idea of what she would be in for if he really told her everything. Perhaps a little anecdote about hand-to-hand combat with Chinese river pirates on the banks of the Yangtze would break the ice. Through a door and down the hall, he can see a corner of the family chapel, all Gothic arches, a gilded altar, and in front of it an embroidered kneeler worn threadbare by the patellas of Mrs. Pascual.

Cigarettes are brought round, stacked in a large lacquer box like artillery shells in a crate. They drink tea and exchange small talk for what seems like about thirty-six hours. Mrs. Pascual wants to be reassured, over and over again, that everything is fine and that there will not be a war. Mr. Pascual obviously believes that war is just around the corner, and mostly broods. Business has been good lately. He and Jack Shaftoe, Bobby's uncle, have been shipping a lot of stuff between here and Singapore. But business will get a lot worse soon, he thinks.

Glory appears. She has changed out of her student's uniform and into a dress. Bobby Shaftoe nearly topples backward out of the window. Mrs. Pascual formally reintroduces them. Bobby Shaftoe kisses Glory's hand in what he thinks is more than likely a very gallant gesture. He's glad he did, because Glory is palming a tiny wadded-up note which ends up in his hand.

Glory takes a seat and is duly issued her own teacup. Another eternity of small talk. Mr. Pascual asks him for the eighty-seventh time whether he has touched base with Uncle Jack yet, and Shaftoe reiterates that he literally just stepped off the boat and will certainly see Uncle Jack tomorrow morning. He excuses himself to the bathroom, which is an old-fashioned two-holer mounted above deep shafts that must descend all the way to hell. He unwads and reads Glory's note, memorizes the instructions, tears it up and sprinkles it down the hole.

Mrs. Pascual allows the two young lovers a full half hour of ``private'' time together, meaning that the Pascuals leave the room and only come back every five minutes or so to check up on them. There is a painfully elaborate and lengthy good-bye ceremony which ends in Shaftoe returning to the street and Glory waving to him from her balcony.

Half an hour later, they are doing tongue judo in the back of a horse-drawn taxi galloping over the cobblestones toward the nightclubs of Malate. The extraction of Glory from the Pascual residence was a simple matter for a highly motivated China Marine and a squadron of saucy nursing students.

But Glory must be kissing him with her eyes open because all of a sudden she wriggles loose and says to the taxi driver, ``Stop! Please stop, sir!''

``What is it?'' Shaftoe says blurrily. He looks around and sees nothing but a great big old stone church looming up above them. This brings a preliminary stab of fear. But the church is dark, there's no Filipinas in long dresses, no Marines in dress uniforms, it can't be his wedding.

``I want to show you something,'' Glory says, and clambers down out of the taxi. Shaftoe has to pursue her into the place--the Church of San Augustin. He's gone by this pile many times but he never reckoned he would come inside--on a date.

She stands at the bottom of a huge staircase and says, ``See?''

Shaftoe looks up into darkness, thinks there might be a stained-glass window or two up there, maybe a Laceration of Christ or an Impalement of the Blessed Thorax, but--

``Look down,'' Glory says, and taps one miniature foot against the first tread of the staircase. It is a single great big huge slab of granite.

``Looks like ten or twenty tons of rock there I'd estimate,'' he says authoritatively.

``It came from Mexico.''

``Ah, go on!''

Glory smiles at him. ``Carry me up the stairs.'' And in case Shaftoe's thinking of refusing, she sort of falls into him, and he has no choice but to catch her up in his arms. She traps his nape in the crook of her arm, the better to pull her face close to his, but what he remembers is how the silk of her sleeve feels against the freshly shaved skin of his neck. He begins the ascent. Glory doesn't weigh much, but after four steps he has broken a fine sweat. She is watching him, from four inches away, for signs of fatigue, and he feels himself blushing. Good thing that the whole staircase is lit up by about two candles. There's a lovely bust of a thorn-crowned Jesus with long parallel blood-drops running down his face, and on the right--

``These giant stones you are walking on were quarried in Mexico, centuries and centuries ago, before America was even a country. They were brought over in the bottoms of the Manila Galleons, as ballast.'' She pronounces it bayast.

``I'll be damned.''

``When those galleons arrived, the stones were brought out of their bellies, one by one, and taken here to the Church of San Agustin, and piled up. Each stone on top of the last year's stone. Until finally after many, many years this staircase was finished.''

After a while it seems to Shaftoe as though it's going to take at least that many years to reach the top of the damn thing. The summit is adorned with a life-sized Jesus carrying a cross that appears to be at least as heavy as one of those stair-treads. So who's he to complain? Then Glory says, ``Now carry me down, so you will remember the story.''

``You think I'm some horny jarhead who won't remember a story unless it's got a pretty girl in it?''

``Yes,'' Glory says, and laughs in his face. He carries her down to the bottom again. Then, before she goes off on some other tangent, he carries her straight out the door and into the taxi.

Bobby Shaftoe is not one to lose his cool in the heat of action, but the rest of the evening is a blurry fever dream to him. Only a few impressions penetrate the haze: alighting from the taxi in front of a waterfront hotel; all of the other boys gaping at Glory; Bobby Shaftoe glaring at them, threatening to teach them some manners. Slow dancing with Glory in the ballroom, Glory's silk-clad thigh gradually slipping between his legs, her firm body pressing harder and harder against his. Strolling along the seawall, hand in hand beneath the starlight. Noticing that the tide is out. Exchanging a look. Carrying her down from the seawall to the thin strip of rocky beach beneath it.

By the time he is actually fucking her, he has more or less lost consciousness, he is off in some fantastic, libidinal dream. He and Glory fuck without the slightest hesitation, without any doubts, without any troublesome thinking whatsoever. Their bodies have spontaneously merged, like a pair of drops running together on a windowpane. If he is thinking anything at all, it is that his entire life has culminated in this moment. His upbringing in Oconomowoc, high school prom night, deer hunting in the Upper Peninsula, Parris Island boot camp, all of the brawls and struggles in China, his duel with Sergeant Frick, they are wood behind the point of a spear.

Sirens are blowing somewhere. He startles back to awareness. Has he been here all night long, holding Glory up against the seawall, her thighs wrapped around his waist? That would not be possible. The tide hasn't come in at all.

``What is it?'' she says. Her hands are clasped around the back of his neck. She lets go and runs them down his chest.

Still holding her up, his hands making a sling under her warm and flawless ass, Shaftoe backs away from the seawall and turns around on the beach, looking at the sky. He sees searchlights beginning to come on. And it ain't no Hollywood premiere.

``It's war, baby,'' he says.



FORAYS

The lobby of the manila hotel is about the size of a football field. It smells like last year's perfume, rare tropical orchids, and bug spray. There is a metal detector set up at the front door, because the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe happens to be staying here for a couple of days. Big Africans in good suits stand around the place in clusters of two and three. Mini-throngs of Nipponese tourists, in their Bermuda shorts, sandals and white socks, have lodged themselves in the deep, thick, wide sofas and sit quietly, waiting for a prearranged signal. Upper-class Filipino children brandish cylindrical potato chip canisters like tribal chieftains carrying ceremonial maces. A dignified old bellman carrying a hand-pumped tank circulates around the defensive perimeter and silently sprays insecticide against the baseboard. Enter Randall Lawrence Waterhouse, in a turquoise polo shirt embroidered with the logo of one of the bankrupt high-tech companies that he and Avi have founded, and relaxed-fit blue jeans held up with suspenders, and bulky athletic shoes that once were white.

As soon as he got through the formalities at the airport, he perceived that the Philippines are, like Mexico, one of those countries where Shoes Matter. He approaches the registration counter quickly so that the ravishing young woman in the navy-blue uniform will not see his feet. A couple of bellhops are engaged in a pathetic, Sisyphean contest with his bag, which has roughly the dimensions and mass of a two-drawer filing cabinet. ``You will not be able to find technical books there,'' Avi told him, ``bring anything you might conceivably need.''

Randy's suite is a bedroom and living room, both with fourteen-foot ceilings, and a corridor along one side containing several closets and various plumbing-related technologies. The entire thing is lined in some kind of tropical hardwood stained to a lovely glowing auburn, which would be dismal in the northern latitudes but, here, gives it a cozy and cool feeling. The two main rooms each have huge windows with tiny signs by the latch handles warning of tropical insects. Each room is defended from its windows by a multilayered system of interlocking barriers: incredibly massive wooden shutters that rumble back and forth on tracks, like freight trains maneuvering in a switching yard; a second layer of shutters consisting of two-inch squares of nacre held in a polished wooden grid, sliding on its own set of tracks; window sheers, and finally, heavy-gauge blackout curtains, each suspended from its own set of clanging industrial rails.

He orders up a large pot of coffee, which barely keeps him awake long enough to unpack. It is late afternoon. Purple clouds tumble out of the surrounding mountains with the palpable momentum of volcanic mudflows and turn half of the sky into a blank wall striped with vertical bolts of lightning; the walls of the hotel room flash with it as though paparazzi are working outside the window. Below, food vendors in Rizal Park run up and down the sidewalks to get out of the rain, which falls, as it has been doing for about half a millennium, on the sloping black walls of Intramuros. If those walls did not run in straight lines they could be mistaken for a natural freak of geology: ridges of bare, dark volcanic rock erupting from the grass like teeth from gums. The walls have dovetail-shaped notches that converge to old gun emplacements, providing interlocking fields of fire across a dry moat.

Living in the States, you never see anything older than about two and a half centuries, and you have to visit the eastern fringe of the country to see that. The business traveler's world of airports and taxicabs looks the same everywhere. Randy never really believes he's in a different country until he sees something like Intramuros, and then he has to stand there like an idiot for a long time, ruminating.

Right now, across the Pacific Ocean, in a small, tasteful Victorian town located a third of the way from San Francisco to Los Angeles, computers are seizing up, crucial files are disappearing, and e-mail is careening into intergalactic space, because Randy Waterhouse is not there to keep an eye on things. The town in question sports three small colleges: one founded by the State of California and two founded by Protestant denominations that are now actively reviled by the majority of their faculty. Taken together these colleges--the Three Siblings--comprise an academic center of middling importance. Their computer systems are linked into one. They exchange teachers and students. From time to time they host academic conferences. This part of California has beaches, mountains, redwood forests, vineyards, golf courses, and sprawling penal facilities all over the place. There are plenty of three- and four-star hotel rooms, and the Three Siblings, taken together, have enough auditoria and meeting rooms to host a conference of several thousand.

Avi's telephone call, some eighty hours ago, arrived in the middle of a major interdisciplinary conference called ``The Intermediate Phase (1939›45) of the Global Hegemony Struggle of the Twentieth Century (Common Era).'' This is a bit of a mouthful and so it has been given a pithy nickname: ``War as Text.''

People are coming from places like Amsterdam and Milan. The conference's organizing committee--which includes Randy's girlfriend, Charlene, who actually gives every indication of being his ex-girlfriend now--hired an artist in San Francisco to come up with a poster. He started with a black-and-white halftone photo of a haggard World War Two infantryman with a cigarette dangling from his lower lip. He worked this image over using a photocopier, blowing the halftone dots up into rough lumps, like rubber balls chewed by a dog, and wreaking any number of other distortions on it until it had an amazingly stark, striking, jagged appearance; the soldier's pale eyes turned an eerie white. Then he added a few elements in color: red lipstick, blue eyeshadow, and a trace of a red brassiere strap peeking out from the soldier's unbuttoned uniform shirt.

The poster won some kind of an award almost the moment it came out. This led to a press release, which in turn led to the poster's being enshrined by the news media as an Official Object of Controversy. An enterprising journalist managed to track down the soldier depicted in the original photograph--a decorated combat veteran and retired tool-and-die maker who, as it happened, was not merely alive but in excellent health, and, since the death of his wife from breast cancer, had spent his retirement roaming around the Deep South in his pickup truck, helping to rebuild black churches that had been torched by drunken yahoos.

The artist who had designed the poster then confessed that he had simply copied it from a book and had made no effort whatsoever to obtain permission--the entire concept of getting permission to use other people's work was faulty, since all art was derivative of other art. High-powered trial lawyers converged, like dive bombers, on the small town in Kentucky where the aggrieved veteran was up on the roof of a black church with a mouthful of nails, hammering down slabs of A/D exterior plywood and mumbling ``no comment'' to a horde of reporters down on the lawn. After a series of conferences in a room at the town's Holiday Inn, the veteran emerged, accompanied by one of the five most famous lawyers on the face of the planet, and announced that he was filing a civil suit against the Three Siblings that would, if it succeeded, turn them and their entire community into a flat, smoking abrasion in the earth's crust. He promised to split the proceeds between the black churches and various disabled veterans' and breast cancer research groups.

The organizing committee pulled the poster from circulation, which caused thousands of bootleg copies to go up on the World Wide Web and, in general, brought it to the attention of millions who never would have seen it otherwise. They also filed suit against the artist, whose net worth could be tallied up on the back of a ticket stub: he had assets of about a thousand dollars and debts (mostly student loans) amounting to sixty-five thousand.

All of this happened before the conference even began. Randy was aware of it only because Charlene had roped him into providing computer support for the conference, which meant setting up a Web site and e-mail access for the attendees. When all of this hit the news, e-mail began to flood in, and quickly jammed up all of the lines and filled up all of the disk capacity that Randy had spent the last month setting up.

Conferees began to arrive. A lot of them seemed to be sleeping in the house where Randy and Charlene had been living together for seven years. It was a big old Victorian house and there was plenty of room. They stumbled in from Heidelberg and Paris and Berkeley and Boston, then sat around Randy and Charlene's kitchen table drinking coffee and talking at great length about the Spectacle. Randy inferred that the Spectacle meant the poster furor, but as they went on and on about it, he sensed that they were using the word not in a conventional sense but as part of some academic jargon; that it carried a heavy load of shadings and connotations to them, none of which Randy would ever understand unless he became one of them.

To Charlene, and to all of the people attending War as Text, it was self-evident that the veteran who filed the lawsuit was the very worst kind of human being--just the sort they had gathered together to debunk, burn in effigy, and sweep into the ash-bin of posthistorical discourse. Randy had spent a lot of time around these people, and thought he'd gotten used to them, but during those days he had a headache all the time, from clenching his teeth, and he kept jumping to his feet in the middle of meals or conversations and going out for solitary walks. This was partly to keep himself from saying something undiplomatic, and partly as a childish but fruitless tactic to get the attention he craved from Charlene.

He knew the whole poster saga was going to be a disaster from early on. He kept warning Charlene and the others. They listened coolly, clinically, as if Randy were a test subject on the wrong side of a one-way mirror.



Randy forces himself to stay awake long enough for it to get dark. Then he lies in bed for a few hours trying to sleep. The container port is just north of the hotel, and all night long, Rizal Boulevard, along the base of the old Spanish wall, is jammed from one end to the other with container-carrying semis. The whole city is a cauldron of internal combustion. Manila seems to have more pistons and exhaust pipes than the rest of the world combined. Even at two in the morning the hotel's seemingly unshakable mass hums and rattles from the seismic energy pouring from all of those motors. The noise detonates car alarms down in the hotel's lot. The noise of one alarm triggers others, and so on. It is not the noise that keeps Randy awake so much as the insane stupidity of this chain reaction. It is an object lesson: the kind of nightmarish, snowballing technological fuck-up that keeps hackers awake at night even when they can't hear the results.

He paws open a Heineken from his minibar and stands in front of the window, looking. Many of the trucks are adorned with brilliant displays of multicolored lights--not quite as flashy as those of the few jeepneys that scurry and jostle among them. Seeing so many people awake and working puts sleep out of the question.

He is too jet-lagged to accomplish anything that requires actual thought--but there is one important job he can do, which requires no thinking whatsoever. He starts up his laptop again. Seeming to levitate in the center of his dark room, the screen is a perfect rectangle of light the color of diluted milk, of a Nordic dawn. This light originates in small fluorescent tubes imprisoned in the polycarbonate coffin of his computer's display. It can only escape through a pane of glass, facing Randy, which is entirely covered by small transistors arranged in a grid, which let photons through, or don't, or let through only those of a particular wavelength, cracking the pale light into colors. By turning those transistors on and off according to some systematic plan, meaning is conveyed to Randy Waterhouse. A good filmmaker could convey a whole story to Randy by seizing control of those transistors for a couple of hours.

Unfortunately, there are a lot more laptop computers floating around than there are filmmakers worth paying attention to. The transistors are almost never put into the hands of human beings. They are controlled, instead, by software. Randy used to be fascinated by software, but now he isn't. It's hard enough to find human beings who are interesting.

The pyramid and the eyeball appear. Randy spends so much time using Ordo now that he has his machine boot it up automatically.

Nowadays the laptop has only one function for Randy: he uses it to communicate with other people, through e-mail. When he communicates with Avi, he has to use Ordo, which is a tool for taking his ideas and converting them into streams of bits that are almost indistinguishable from white noise, so that they can be sent to Avi in privacy. In exchange, it receives noise from Avi and converts it into Avi's thoughts. At the moment, Epiphyte has no assets other than information--it is an idea, with some facts and data to back it up. This makes it eminently stealable. So encryption is definitely a good idea. The question is: how much paranoia is really appropriate?

Avi sent him encrypted e-mail:

When you get to Manila I would like you to generate a 4096-bit key pair and keep it on a floppy disk that you carry on your person at all times. Do not keep it on your hard disk. Anyone could break into your hotel room while you're out and steal that key.

Now, Randy pulls down a menu and picks an item labeled: ``New key. . . . ''

A box pops up giving him several KEY LENGTH options: 768 bits, 1024, 1536, 2048, 3072, or Custom. Randy picks the latter option and then, wearily, types in 4096.

Even a 768-bit key requires vast resources to break. Add one bit, to make it 769 bits long, and it becomes twice as difficult. A 770-bit key is twice as difficult yet, and so on. By using 768-bit keys, Randy and Avi could keep their communications secret from nearly every entity in the world for at least the next several years. A 1024-bit key would be vastly, astronomically more difficult to break.

Some people go so far as to use keys 2048 or even 3072 bits in length. These will stop the very best codebreakers on the face of the earth for astronomical periods of time, barring the invention of otherworldly technologies such as quantum computers. Most encryption software--even stuff written by extremely security-conscious cryptography experts--can't even handle keys larger than that. But Avi insists on using Ordo, generally considered the best encryption software in the world, because it can handle keys of unlimited length--as long as you don't mind waiting for it to crunch all the numbers.

Randy begins typing. He is not bothering to look at the screen; he is staring out the window at the lights on the trucks and the jeepneys. He is only using one hand, just flailing away loosely at the keyboard.

Inside Randy's computer is a precise clock. Whenever he strikes a key, Ordo uses that clock to record the current time, down to microseconds. He hits a key at 03:05:56.935788 and he hits another one at 03:05:57.290664, or about .354876 seconds later. Another .372307 seconds later, he hits another one. Ordo keeps track of all of these intervals and discards the more significant digits (in this example the .35 and the .37) because these parts will tend to be similar from one event to the next.

Ordo wants randomness. It only wants the least significant digits--say, the 76 and the 07 at the very ends of these numbers. It wants a whole lot of random numbers, and it wants them to be very, very random. It is taking somewhat random numbers and feeding them through hash functions that make them even more random. It is running statistical routines on the results to make sure that they contain no hidden patterns. It has breathtakingly high standards for randomness, and it will not stop asking Randy to whack on the keyboard until those standards are met.

The longer the key you are trying to generate, the longer this takes. Randy is trying to generate one that is ridiculously long. He has pointed out to Avi, in an encrypted e-mail message, that if every particle of matter in the universe could be used to construct one single cosmic supercomputer, and this computer was put to work trying to break a 4096-bit encryption key, it would take longer than the lifespan of the universe.

``Using today's technology,'' Avi shot back, ``that is true. But what about quantum computers? And what if new mathematical techniques are developed that can simplify the factoring of large prime numbers?''

``How long do you want these messages to remain secret?'' Randy asked, in his last message before leaving San Francisco. ``Five years? Ten years? Twenty-five years?''

After he got to the hotel this afternoon, Randy decrypted and read Avi's answer. It is still hanging in front of his eyes, like the afterimage of a strobe:

I want them to remain secret for as long as men are capable of evil.

The computer finally beeps. Randy rests his tired hand. Ordo politely warns him that it may be busy for a while, and then goes to work. It is searching the cosmos of pure numbers, looking for two big primes that can be multiplied by each other to produce a number 4096 bits long.

If you want your secrets to remain secret past the end of your life expectancy, then, in order to choose a key length, you have to be a futurist. You have to anticipate how much faster computers will get during this time. You must also be a student of politics. Because if the entire world were to become a police state obsessed with recovering old secrets, then vast resources might be thrown at the problem of factoring large prime numbers.

So the length of the key that you use is, in and of itself, a code of sorts. A knowledgeable government eavesdropper, noting Randy's and Avi's use of a 4096-bit key, will conclude one of the following:

--Avi doesn't know what he's talking about. This can be ruled out with a bit of research into his past accomplishments. Or,

--Avi is clinically paranoid. This can also be ruled out with some research. Or,

--Avi is extremely optimistic about the future development of computer technology, or pessimistic about the political climate, or both. Or,

--Avi has a planning horizon that extends over a period of at least a century.

Randy paces around his room while his computer soars through number space. The shipping containers on the backs of those trucks bear exactly the same logos as the ones that used to fill the streets of South Seattle when a ship was unloading. To Randy this is oddly satisfying, as if, by making this crazy lunge across the Pacific, he has brought some kind of antipodal symmetry to his life. He has gone from the place where things are consumed to where they are produced, from a land where onanism has been enshrined at the highest levels of the society to one where cars have ``NO to contraception!'' stickers in their windows. It feels bizarrely right. He has not felt this way since Avi and he founded their first doomed business venture twelve years ago.



Randy grew up in a college town in eastern Washington State, graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle, and landed a Clerk Typist II job at the library there--specifically the Interlibrary Loan Department--where his job was to process incoming loan requests mailed in from smaller libraries all over the region and, conversely, to mail out requests to other libraries. If nine-year-old Randy Waterhouse had been able to look into the future and see himself in this career, he would have been delighted beyond measure: the primary tool of the Interlibrary Loan Department was the Staple Remover. Young Randy had seen one of these devices in the hands of his fourth-grade teacher and been enthralled by its cunning and deadly appearance, so like the jaws of some futuristic robot dragon. He had, in fact, gone out of his way to staple things incorrectly just so he could prevail on his teacher to unstaple them, giving him another glimpse of the blood-chilling mandibles in action. He had gone so far as to steal a staple remover from an untended desk at church and then incorporate it into an Erector-set robot hunter-killer device with which he terrorized much of the neighborhood; its pit-viper yawn separated many a cheap plastic toy from its parts and accessories before the theft was discovered and Randy made an example of before God and man. Now, in the Interlibrary Loan office, Randy had not just one but several staple removers in his desk drawer and was actually obligated to use them for an hour or two a day.

Since the UW library was well-endowed, its patrons didn't request books from other libraries unless they had been stolen from their own or were, in some way, peculiar. The ILL office (as Randy and his coworkers affectionately called it) had its regulars--people who had a whole lot of peculiar books on their wish lists. These people tended to be either tedious or scary or both. Randy always ended up dealing with the ``both'' subgroup, because Randy was the only Clerk Typist in the office who was not a lifer. It seemed clear that Randy, with his astronomy degree and his extensive knowledge of computers, would one day move on, whereas his coworkers did not harbor further ambitions. His larger sphere of interests, his somewhat broader concept of normalcy, was useful when certain patrons came into the office.

By the standards of many, Randy was himself a tedious, scary, obsessed character. He was not merely obsessed with science but also with fantasy role-playing games. The only way he could tolerate working at such a stupid job for a couple of years was that his off time was completely occupied with enacting fantasy scenarios of a depth and complexity that exercised all of the cranial circuitry that was so conspicuously going to waste in the ILL office. He was part of a group that would meet every Friday night and play until sometime on Sunday. The other stalwarts in the group were a computer science/music double major named Chester, and a history grad student named Avi.

When a new master's degree candidate named Andrew Loeb walked into the ILL office one day, with a certain glint in his eye, and produced a three-inch-thick stack of precisely typed request forms from his shitty old knapsack, he was recognized immediately as being of a particular type, and shunted in the direction of Randy Waterhouse. It was an instant meeting of minds, though Randy did not fully realize this until the books that Loeb had requested began to arrive on the trolley from the mail room.

Andy Loeb's project was to figure out the energy budgets of the local Indian tribes. A human body has to expend a certain amount of energy just to keep breathing and to maintain its body temperature. This figure goes up when it gets cold or when the body in question is doing work. The only way to obtain that energy is by eating food. Some foods have a higher energy content than others. For example, trout is highly nutritious but so low in fat and carbohydrates that you can starve to death eating it three times a day. Other foods might have lots of energy, but might require so much work to obtain and prepare that eating them would be a losing proposition, BTU-wise. Andy Loeb was trying to figure out what foods had historically been eaten by certain Northwest Indian tribes, how much energy they expended to get these foods and how much they obtained by eating them. He wanted to do this calculation for coastal Indians like the Salish (who had easy access to seafood) and for inland ones like the Cayuse (who didn't) as part of an extremely convoluted plan to prove some sort of point about the relative standards of living of these tribes and how this affected their cultural development (coastal tribes made lots of fantastically detailed art and inland ones occasionally scratched stick figures on rocks).

To Andrew Loeb it was an exercise in meta-historical scholarship. To Randy Waterhouse, it sounded like the beginnings of a pretty cool game. Strangle a muskrat and you get 136 Energy Points. Lose the muskrat and your core temp drops another degree.

Andy was nothing if not methodical and so he had simply looked up every book that had ever been written on such topics, and every book mentioned in those books' bibliographies, yea, even unto four or five generations; checked out all of them that were available locally; and ordered the rest from ILL. All of the latter passed across Randy's desk. Randy read some and skimmed all. He got to learn about how much blubber the Arctic explorers had to eat in order to keep from starving to death. He perused detailed specifications for Army C-rations. After a while, he actually began sneaking into the photocopy room and making copies of key data.

In order to run a realistic fantasy role-playing game, you had to keep track of how much food the imaginary characters were getting and how much trouble was involved in getting it. Characters passing across the Gobi desert in November of the year 5000 B.C. would have to spend more time worrying about food than, say, ones who were traveling across central Illinois in 1950.

Randy was hardly the first game designer to notice this. There were a few incredibly stupid games in which you didn't have to think about food, but Randy and his friends disdained them. In all of the games that he participated in, or that he himself designed, you had to devote a realistic amount of effort to getting food for your character. But it was not easy to determine what was realistic. Like most designers, Randy got over the problem by slapping together a few rudimentary equations that he basically just pulled out of thin air. But in the books, articles, and dissertations that Andrew Loeb was borrowing through ILL, he found exactly the raw data that a mathematically inclined person would need to come up with a sophisticated rules system based on scientific fact.

Stimulating all of the physical processes going on in each character's body was out of the question, especially in a game where you might be dealing with armies of a hundred thousand men. Even a crude simulation, tracking only a few variables and using simple equations, would involve a nightmarish amount of paperwork if you did it all by hand. But all of this was happening in the mid-1980s, when personal computers had become cheap and ubiquitous. A computer could automatically track a large database and tell you whether each character was well-fed or starving. There was no reason not to do it on a computer.

Unless, like Randy Waterhouse, you had such a shitty job that you couldn't afford a computer.

Of course, there's a way to dodge any problem. The university had lots of computers. If Randy could get an account on one of them, he could write his program there and run it for free.

Unfortunately, accounts were only available to students or faculty members, and Randy was neither.

Fortunately, he started dating a grad student named Charlene at just about this time.

How the hell did a generally keg-shaped guy, a hard scientist, working a dead-end Clerk Typist job, and spending all his spare time in the consummately nerdy pastime of fantasy role-playing games, end up in a relationship with a slender and not unattractive young liberal arts student who spent her spare time sea kayaking and going to foreign films? It must have been one of those opposites-attract kind of deals, a complementary relationship. They met, naturally, in the ILL office, where the highly intelligent but steady and soothing Randy helped the highly intelligent but scattered and flighty Charlene organize a messy heap of loan requests. He should have asked her out then and there, but he was shy. Second and third opportunities came along when the books she'd requested began to filter up from the mailroom, and finally he asked her out and they went to see a film together. Both of them turned out to be not just willing but eager, and possibly even desperate. Before they knew it, Randy had given Charlene a key to his apartment, and Charlene had given Randy the password to her free university computer account, and everything was just delightful.

The university computer system was better than no computer at all. But Randy was humiliated. Like every other high-powered academic computing network, this one was based on an industrial-strength operating system called UNIX, which had a learning curve like the Matterhorn, and lacked the cuddly and stylish features of the personal computers then coming into vogue. Randy had used it quite a bit as an undergraduate and knew his way around. Even so, learning how to write good code on the thing required a lot of time. His life had changed when Charlene had come along, and now it changed more: he dropped out of the fantasy role-playing game circuit altogether, stopped going to meetings of the Society for Creative Anachronism, and began to spend all of his free time either with Charlene or in front of a computer terminal. All in all, this was probably a change for the better. With Charlene, he did things he wouldn't have done otherwise, like getting exercise, or going to see live music. And at the computer, he was learning new skills, and he was creating something. It might be something completely useless, but at least he was creating.

He spent a lot of time talking to Andrew Loeb, who actually went out and did the stuff he was writing programs for; he'd disappear for a few days and come back all wobbly and haggard, with fish scales caught in his whiskers or dried animal blood under his fingernails. He'd ram down a couple of Big Macs, sleep for twenty-four hours, then meet Randy in a bar (Charlene wasn't comfortable with having him in the house) and talk learnedly of the difficulties of day-to-day life, aboriginal style. They argued about whether aborigines would eat the more disgusting parts of certain animals or throw them away. Andrew voted for yes. Randy disagreed--just because they were primitive didn't mean they couldn't have taste. Andrew accused him of being a romantic. Finally, to settle it, they went up into the mountains together, armed with nothing but knives and Andrew's collection of exquisitely crafted vermin snares. By the third night, Randy found himself seriously thinking about eating some insects. ``Q.E.D.,'' Andrew said.

Anyway, Randy finished his software after a year and a half. It was a success; Chester and Avi liked it. Randy was moderately pleased at having built something so complicated that actually worked, but he had no illusions about its being good for anything. He was sort of embarrassed at having wasted so much time and mental energy on the project. But he knew that if he hadn't been writing code, he'd have spent the same amount of time playing games or going to Society for Creative Anachronism meetings in medieval drag, so it all zeroed out in the end. Spending the time in front of the computer was arguably better, because it had honed his programming skills, which had been pretty sharp to begin with. On the other hand, he'd done it all on the UNIX system, which was for scientists and engineers--not a savvy move in an age when all the money was in personal computers.

Chester and Randy had nicknamed Avi ``Avid,'' because he really, really liked fantasy games. Avi had always claimed that he played them as a way of understanding what it was really like to live in ancient times, and he was a maniac about historical authenticity. That was okay; they all had half-assed excuses, and Avi's historical acumen frequently came in handy.

Not long after this, Avi graduated and disappeared, and popped up a few months later in Minneapolis, where he had gotten a job with a major publisher of fantasy role-playing games. He offered to buy Randy's game software for the astonishingly large sum of $1000 plus a small cut of future profits. Randy accepted the offer in its general outlines, asked Avi to send him a contract, then went out and found Andrew boiling some fish guts in a birchbark kettle atop a Weber grill on the roof of the apartment building where he lived. He wanted to give Andrew the good news, and to cut him in on the proceeds. What ensued was a really unpleasant conversation, standing up there in a pelting, spitting, wind-blown rain.

To begin with, Andrew took this deal far more seriously than Randy did. Randy saw it as a windfall, a lark. Andrew, who was the son of a lawyer, treated it as if it were a major corporate merger, and asked many tedious and niggling questions about the contract, which did not exist yet and which would probably cover a single piece of paper when it did. Randy didn't realize it at the time, but by asking so many questions for which Randy had no answers, Andrew was, in effect, arrogating to himself the role of Business Manager. He was implicitly forming a business partnership with Randy that did not, in fact, exist.

Furthermore, Andrew didn't have the first notion of how much time and effort Randy had put into writing the code. Or (as Randy was to realize later) maybe he did. In any case, Andrew assumed from the get-go that he would share a fifty-fifty split with Randy, which was wildly out of proportion to the work he'd actually done on the project. Basically, Andrew acted as if all of the work he'd ever done on the subject of aboriginal dining habits was a part of this undertaking, and that it entitled him to an equal split.

By the time Randy extricated himself from this conversation, his mind was reeling. He had gone in with one view of reality and been radically challenged by another one that was clearly preposterous; but after an hour of Andrew's browbeating he was beginning to doubt himself. After two or three sleepless nights, he decided to call the whole thing off. A paltry few hundred dollars wasn't worth all of this agony.

But Andrew (who was, by now, represented by an associate of his father's Santa Barbara law firm) vehemently objected. He and Randy had, according to his lawyer, jointly created something that had economic value, and a failure on Randy's part to sell it at market value amounted to taking money out of Andrew's pocket. It had become an unbelievable Kafkaesque nightmare, and Randy could only withdraw to a corner table at his favorite pub, drink pints of stout (frequently in the company of Chester) and watch this fantastic psychodrama unfold. He had, he now realized, blundered into some serious domestic weirdness involving Andrew's family. It turned out that Andrew's parents were divorced and, long ago, had fought savagely over custody of him, their only child. Mom had turned into a hippie and joined a religious cult in Oregon and taken Andrew with her. It was rumored that this cult engaged in sexual abuse of children. Dad had hired private dicks to kidnap Andrew back and then showered him with material possessions to demonstrate his superior love. There had followed an interminable legal battle in which Dad had hired some rather fringey psychotherapists to hypnotize Andrew and get him to dredge up repressed memories of unspeakable and improbable horrors.

This was just the executive summary of a weird life that Randy only learned about in bits and pieces as the years went on. Later, he was to decide that Andrew's life had been fractally weird. That is, you could take any small piece of it and examine it in detail and it, in and of itself, would turn out to be just as complicated and weird as the whole thing in its entirety.

Anyway Randy had blundered into this life and become enveloped in the weirdness. One of the young eager beavers in Andrew's dad's law firm decided, as a preemptive move, to obtain copies of all of Randy's computer files, which were still stored on the UW computer system. Needless to say, he went about it in a heavy-handed way, and when the university's legal department began to receive his sullen letters, it responded by informing both Andrew's lawyer, and Randy, that anyone who used the university's computer system to create a commercial product had to split the proceeds with the university. So now Randy was getting ominous letters from not one but two groups of deadly lawyers. Andrew then threatened to sue him for having made this blunder, which had halved the value of Andrew's share!

In the end, just to cut his losses and get out of it clean, Randy had to hire a lawyer of his own. The final cost to him was a hair more than five thousand dollars. The software was never sold to anyone, and indeed could not have been; it was so legally encumbered by that point that it would have been like trying to sell someone a rusty Volkswagen that had been dismantled and its parts hidden in attack dog kennels all over the world.

It was the only time in his life when he had ever thought about suicide. He did not think about it very hard, or very seriously, but he did think about it.

When it was all over, Avi sent him a handwritten letter saying, ``I enjoyed doing business with you and look forward to continuing our relationship both as friends and, should opportunities arise, as creative partners.''


INDIGO



Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse and the rest of the band are up on the deck of the Nevada one morning, playing the national anthem and watching the Stars and Stripes ratchet up the mast, when they are startled to find themselves in the midst of one hundred and ninety airplanes of unfamiliar design. Some of them are down low, traveling horizontally, and others are up high, plunging nearly straight down. The latter are going so fast that they appear to be falling apart; little bits are dropping off of them. It is terrible to see--some training exercise gone miserably awry. But they pull out of their suicidal trajectories in plenty of time. The bits that have fallen off of them plunge smoothly and purposefully, not tumbling and fluttering as chunks of debris would. They are coming down all over the place. Perversely, they all seem to be headed for the berthed ships. It is incredibly dangerous--they might hit someone! Lawrence is outraged.

There is a short-lived phenomenon taking place in one of the ships down the line. Lawrence turns to look at it. This is the first real explosion he's ever seen and so it takes him a long time to recognize it as such. He can play the very hardest glockenspiel parts with his eyes closed, and The Star Spangled Banner is much easier to ding than to sing.

His scanning eyes fasten, not on the source of the explosion, but on a couple of airplanes that are headed right toward them, skimming just above the water. Each drops a long skinny egg and then their tailplanes visibly move and they angle upwards and pass overhead. The rising sun shines directly through the glass of their canopies. Lawrence is able to look into the eyes of the pilot of one of the planes. He notes that it appears to be some sort of Asian gentleman.

This is an incredibly realistic training exercise--even down to the point of using ethnically correct pilots, and detonating fake explosives on the ships. Lawrence heartily approves. Things have just been too lax around this place.

A tremendous shock comes up through the deck of the ship, making his feet and legs feel as if he had just jumped off a ten-foot precipice onto solid concrete. But he's just standing there flatfooted. It makes no sense at all.

The band have finished playing the national anthem and are looking about at the spectacle. Sirens and horns are speaking up all over the place, from the Nevada, from the Arizona in the next berth, from buildings onshore. Lawrence doesn't see any antiaircraft fire going up, doesn't see any familiar planes in the air. The explosions just keep coming. Lawrence wanders over to the rail and stares across a few yards of open water towards the Arizona.

Another one of those plunging airplanes drops a projectile that shoots straight down onto Arizona's deck but then, strangely, vanishes. Lawrence blinks and sees that it has left a neat bomb-shaped hole in the deck, just like a panicky Warner Brothers cartoon character passing at high speed through a planar structure such as a wall or ceiling. Fire jets from that hole for about a microsecond before the whole deck bulges up, disintegrating, and turns into a burgeoning globe of fire and blackness. Waterhouse is vaguely aware of a lot of stuff coming at him really fast. It is so big that he feels more like he is falling into it. He freezes up. It goes by him, over him, and through him. A terrible noise pierces his skull, a chord randomly struck, discordant but not without some kind of deranged harmony. Musical qualities aside, it is so goddamned loud that it almost kills him. He claps his hands over his ears.

Still the noise is there, like red-hot knitting needles through the eardrums. Hell's Bells. He spins away from it, but it follows him. He has this big thick strap around his neck, sewn together at groin level where it supports a cup. Thrust into the cup is the central support of his glockenspiel, which stands in front of him like a lyre-shaped breastplate, huge fluffy tassels dangling gaily from the upper corners. Oddly, one of the tassels is burning. That isn't the only thing now wrong with the glockenspiel, but he can't quite make it out because his vision keeps getting obscured by something that must be wiped away every few moments. All he knows is that the glockenspiel has eaten a huge quantum of pure energy and been kicked up to some incredibly high state never before achieved by such an instrument; it is a burning, glowing, shrieking, ringing, radiating monster, a comet, an archangel, a tree of flaming magnesium, strapped to his body, standing on his groin. The energy is transmitted down its humming, buzzing central axis, through the cup, and into his genitals, which would be tumescing in other circumstances.

Lawrence spends some time wandering aimlessly around the deck. Eventually he has to help open a hatch for some men, and then he realizes that his hands are still clapped over his ears, and have been for a long time except for when he was wiping stuff out of his eyes. When he takes them off, the ringing has stopped, and he no longer hears airplanes. He was thinking that he wanted to go belowdecks, because the bad things are coming from the sky and he would like to get some big heavy permanent-seeming stuff between him and it, but a lot of sailors are taking the opposite view. He hears that they have been hit by one and maybe two of something that rhymes with ``torpedoes,'' and that they are trying to raise steam. Officers and noncoms, black and red with smoke and blood, keep deputizing him for different, extremely urgent tasks that he doesn't quite understand, not least because he keeps putting his hands over his ears.

Probably half an hour goes by before he hits upon the idea of discarding his glockenspiel, which is, after all, just getting in the way. It was issued to him by the Navy with any number of stern warnings about the consequences of misusing it. Lawrence is conscientious about this kind of thing, dating back to when he was first given organ-playing privileges in West Point, Virginia. But at this point, for the first time in his life, as he stands there watching the Arizona burn and sink, he just says to himself: Well, to heck with it! He takes that glockenspiel out of its socket and has one last look at it, it is the last time in his life he will ever touch a glockenspiel. There is no point in saving it now anyway, he realizes; several of the bars have been bent. He flips it around and discovers that chunks of blackened, distorted metal have been impact-welded onto several of the bars. Really throwing caution to the winds now, he flings it overboard in the general direction of the Arizona, a military lyre of burnished steel that sings a thousand men to their resting places on the bottom of the harbor.

As it vanishes into a patch of burning oil, the second wave of attacking airplanes arrives. The Navy's antiaircraft guns finally open up and begin to rain shells down into the surrounding community and blow up occupied buildings. He can see human-shaped flames running around in the streets, pursued by people with blankets.

The rest of the day is spent, by Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse and the rest of the Navy, grappling with the fact that many two-dimensional structures on this and other ships, which were put into place to prevent various fluids from commingling (e.g. fuel and air) have holes in them, and not only that but a lot of shit is on fire too and things are more than a little smoky. Certain objects that are supposed to (a) remain horizontal and (b) support heavy things have ceased to do either.

Nevada's engineering section manages to raise steam in a couple of boilers and the captain tries to get the ship out of the harbor. As soon as she gets underway, she comes under concerted attack, mostly by dive bombers who are eager to sink her in the channel and block the harbor altogether. Eventually, the captain runs her aground rather than see this happen. Unfortunately, what Nevada has in common with most other naval vessels is that she is not really engineered to work from a stationary position, and consequently she is hit three more times by dive bombers. So it is a pretty exciting morning overall. As a member of the band who does not even have his instrument any more, Lawrence's duties are quite poorly defined, and he spends more time than he should watching the airplanes and the explosions. He has gone back to his earlier train of thought regarding societies and their efforts to outdo each other. It is very clear to him, as wave after wave of Nipponese dive bombers hurl themselves, with calligraphic precision, at the ship he is standing on, and as the cream of his society's navy burns and explodes and sinks, putting up virtually no resistance, that his society is going to have to rethink a thing or two.



At some point he burns his hand on something. It is his right hand, which is preferable--he is left-handed. Also, he becomes more clearly aware that a portion of Arizona has tried to take his scalp off. These are minor injuries by Pearl Harbor standards and he does not stay long in the hospital. The doctor warns him that the skin on his hand might contract and limit his fingers' range of motion. As soon as he can withstand the pain, Lawrence begins to play Bach's Art of Fugue in his lap whenever he is not otherwise occupied. Most of those tunes start out simple; you can easily picture old Johann Sebastian sitting there on the bench on a cold morning in Leipzig, one or two blockflote stops yanked out, left hand in his lap, a fat choirboy or two over in the corner heaving away on the bellows, faint gasping noises coming from all the leaks in the works, and Johann's right hand wandering aimlessly across the forbidding simplicity of the Great manual, stroking those cracked and yellowed elephant tusks, searching for some melody he hadn't already invented. That is good stuff for Lawrence right now, and so he makes his right hand go through the same motions as Johann's, even though it is a gauze-wrapped hand and he is using an upside-down dinner tray as a substitute for the keyboard, and he has to hum the music under his breath. When he really gets into it, his feet skid around and piston under the sheets, playing imaginary pedals, and his neighbors complain.

He is out of the hospital in a few days, just in time for him and the rest of Nevada's band to begin their new, wartime assignment. This was evidently something of a poser for the Navy's manpower experts. These musicians were (from a killing-Nips point of view) completely useless to begin with. As of 7 December, they no longer have even a functioning ship and most of them have lost their clarinets.

Still, it isn't all about loading shells and pulling triggers. No large organization can kill Nips in any kind of systematic way without doing a nearly unbelievable amount of typing and filing. It is logical to suppose that men who can play the clarinet will not botch that kind of work any worse than anyone else. And so Waterhouse and his bandmates receive orders assigning them to what would appear to be one of the typing-and-filing branches of the Navy.

This is located in a building, not a ship. There are quite a few Navy people who sneer at the whole idea of working in a building, and Lawrence and some of the other recent recruits, eager to fit in, have gotten into the habit of copping the same attitude. But now that they have seen what happens to a ship when you detonate hundreds of pounds of high explosive on, in, and around it, Waterhouse and many others are reassessing their feelings about working in buildings. They report to their new post with high morale.

Their new commanding officer is not so cheerful, and his feelings appear to be shared by everyone in the entire section. The musicians are greeted without being welcomed and saluted without being honored. The people who have been working in this building--far from being overawed by their status as guys who not only worked on an actual ship until recently but furthermore have been very close to things that were exploding, burning, etc., and not as the result of routine lapses in judgment but because bad men deliberately made it happen--do not seem to feel that Lawrence and his bandmates deserve to be entrusted with this new work, whatever the hell it is.

Glumly, almost despairingly, the commanding officer and his subordinates get the musicians squared away. Even if they don't have enough desks to go around, each man can at least have a chair at a table or counter. Some ingenuity is displayed in finding places for all the new arrivals. It is clear that these people are trying their best at what they considered to be a hopeless task.

Then there is some talk about secrecy. A great deal of talk about it. They run through drills intended to test their ability to throw things away properly. This goes on for a long time and the longer it continues, without an explanation as to why, the more mysterious it becomes. The musicians, who were at first a little put out by their chilly reception, start to speculate amongst themselves as to what kind of an operation they have gotten themselves into now.

Finally, one morning, the musicians are assembled in a classroom in front of the cleanest chalkboard Waterhouse has ever seen. The last few days have imbued him with just enough paranoia that he suspects it is that clean for a reason--erasing chalkboards is not to be taken lightly during wartime.

They are seated in little chairs with desks attached to them, desks designed for right-handers. Lawrence puts his notepad in his lap, then rests his bandaged right hand on the desk and begins to play a ditty from Art of Fugue, grimacing and even grunting with pain as his burned skin stretches and slides over his knuckles.

Someone chucks him on the shoulder. He opens his eyes to see that he is the only person in the room sitting down; an officer is on the deck. He stands up and his weak leg nearly buckles. When he finally gets himself fully to his feet, he sees that the officer (if he even is an officer) is out of uniform. Way out of uniform. He's wearing a bathrobe and smoking a pipe. The bathrobe is extraordinarily worn, and not in the sense of, say, a hospital or hotel bathrobe that gets laundered frequently. This thing hasn't been laundered in a long time, but boy has it seen some use. The elbows are worn out and the bottom of the right sleeve is ashy grey and slippery with graphite from being dragged back and forth, tens of thousands of times, across sheets of paper dense with number-two pencil work. The terrycloth has a dandruffy appearance, but it has nothing to do with exfoliation of the scalp; these flakes are way too big, and too geometric: rectangles and circular dots of oaktag, punched out of cards and tape respectively. The pipe went out a long time ago and the officer (or whatever he is) is not even pretending to worry about getting it relit. It is there just to give him something to bite down on, which he does as vigorously as a civil war infantryman having a leg sawed off.

Some other fellow--one who actually bothered to shave, shower, and put on a uniform--introduces bathrobe man as Commander Shane-spelled-s-c-h-o-e-n, but Schoen is having none of it; he turns his back on them, exposing the back side of his bathrobe, which around the buttocks is worn transparent as a negligee. Reading from a notebook, he writes out the following in block letters:

19 17 17 19 14 20 23 18 19 8 12 16 19 8 3

21 8 25 18 14 18 6 3 18 8 15 18 22 18 11

Around the time that the fourth or fifth number is going up on the chalkboard, Waterhouse feels the hairs standing up on the back of his neck. By the time the third group of five numbers is written out, he has not failed to notice that none of them is larger than 26--that being the number of letters in the alphabet. His heart is pounding more wildly than it did when Nipponese bombs were tracing parabolic trajectories toward the deck of the grounded Nevada. He pulls a pencil out of his pocket. Finding no paper handy, he writes down the numbers from 1 to 26 on the surface of his little writing desk.

By the time the man in the bathrobe is done writing out the last group of numbers, Waterhouse is already well into his frequency count. He wraps it up as Bathrobe Man is saying something along the lines of ``this might look like a meaningless sequence of numbers to you, but to a Nip naval officer it might look like something entirely different.'' Then the man laughs nervously, shakes his head sadly, squares his jaw resolutely, and runs through a litany of other emotion-laden expressions not a single one of which is appropriate here.

Waterhouse's frequency count is simply a tally of how frequently each number appears on the blackboard. It looks like this:

1  14 ||
2  15 |
3 ||  16 |
4  17 ||
5  18 ||||||
6 |  19 ||||
7  20 |
8 ||||  21 |
9  22 |
10  23 |
11 |  24
12 |  25 |
13  26

The most interesting thing about this is that ten of the possible symbols (viz. 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 13, 24, and 26) are not even used. Only sixteen different numbers appear in the message. Assuming each of those sixteen represents one and only one letter of the alphabet, this message has (Lawrence reckons in his head) 111136315345735680000 possible meanings. This is a funny number because it begins with four ones and ends with four zeroes; Lawrence snickers, wipes his nose, and gets on with it.

The most common number is 18. It probably represents the letter E. If he substitutes E into the message everywhere he sees an 18, then--

Well, to be honest, then he'll have to write out the whole message again, substituting Es for 18s, and it will take a long time, and it might be time wasted because he might have guessed wrong. On the other hand, if he just restrains his mind to construe 18s as Es--an operation that he thinks of as being loosely analogous to changing the presets on a pipe organ's console--then what he sees in his mind's eye when he looks at the blackboard is

19 17 17 19 14 20 23 E 19 8 12 16 19 8 3

21 8 25 E 14 E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11

which only has 10103301395066880000 possible meanings. This is a funny number too because of all those ones and zeroes--but it is an absolutely meaningless coincidence.

``The science of making secret codes is called cryptography,'' Commander Schoen says, ``and the science of breaking them is cryptanalysis.'' Then he sighs, grapples visibly with some more widely divergent emotional states, and resignedly plods into the mandatory exercise of breaking these words down into their roots, which are either Latin or Greek (Lawrence isn't paying attention, doesn't care, only glimpses the stark word CRYPTO written in handsized capitals).

The opening sequence ``19 17 17 19'' is peculiar. 19, along with 8, is the second most common number in the list. 17 is only half as common. You can't have four vowels or four consonants in a row (unless the words are German) so either 17 is a vowel and 19 a consonant or the other way round. Since 19 appears more frequently (four times) in the message, it is more likely to be the vowel than 17 (which only appears twice). A is the most common vowel after E, so if he assumes that 19 is A, he gets

A 17 17 A 14 20 23 E A 8 12 16 A 8 3

21 8 25 E 14 E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11


This narrows it down quite a bit, to a mere 841941782922240000 possible answers. He's already reduced the solution space by a couple of orders of magnitude!

Schoen has talked himself up into a disturbingly heavy sweat, now, and is almost bodily flinging himself into a historical overview of the science of CRYPTOLOGY, as the union of cryptography and cryptanalysis is called. There's some talk about an English fellow name of Wilkins, and book called Cryptonomicon that he wrote hundreds of years ago, but (perhaps because he doesn't rate the intelligence of his audience too highly) he goes very easy on the historical background, and jumps directly from Wilkins to Paul Revere's ``one if by land, two if by sea'' code. He even makes a mathematics in-joke about this being one of the earliest practical applications of binary notation. Lawrence dutifully brays and snorts, drawing an appalled look from the saxophonist seated in front of him.

Earlier in his talk, the Schoen mentioned that this message was (in what's obviously a fictional scenario ginned up to make this mathematical exercise more interesting to a bunch of musicians who are assumed not to give a shit about math) addressed to a Nip naval officer. Given that context, Lawrence cannot but guess that the first word of the message is ATTACK. This would mean that 17 represented T, 14 C, and 20 K. When he fills these in, he gets

A T T A C K 23 E A 8 12 16 A 8 3

21 T 25 E C E 6 3 E 8 15 E 22 E 11


and then the rest is so obvious he doesn't bother to write it out. He cannot restrain himself from jumping to his feet. He's so excited he forgets about the weak legs and topples over across a couple of his neighbors' desks, which makes a lot of noise.

``Do you have a problem, sailor?'' says one of the officers in the corner, one who actually bothered to wear a uniform.

``Sir! The message is, `Attack Pearl Harbor December Seven!' Sir!'' Lawrence shouts, and then sits down. His whole body is quivering with excitement. Adrenalin has taken over his body and mind. He could strangle twenty sumo wrestlers on the spot.

Commander Schoen is completely impassive except that he blinks once, very slowly. He turns to one of his subordinates, who is standing against the wall with his hands clasped behind his back, and says, ``Get this one a copy of the Cryptonomicon. And a desk--as close to the coffee machine as possible. And why don't you promote the son of a bitch as long as you're at it.''

The part about the promotion turns out to be either military humor or further evidence of Commander Schoen's mental instability. Other than that small bit of drollery, the story of Waterhouse past this point, for the next ten months, is not much more complicated than the story of a bomb that has just been released from the belly of a plunging airplane. The barriers placed in his path (working his way through the Cryptonomicon, breaking the Nipponese Air Force Meteorological Code, breaking the Coral naval attache machine cipher, breaking Unnamed Nipponese Army Water Transport Code 3A, breaking the Greater East Asia Ministry Code) present about as much resistance as successive decks of a worm-eaten wooden frigate. Within a couple of months he is actually writing new chapters of the Cryptonomicon. People speak of it as though it were a book, but it's not. It is basically a compilation of all of the papers and notes that have drifted up in a particular corner of Commander Schoen's office over the roughly two-year period that he's been situated at Station Hypo, as this place is called.* It is everything that Commander Schoen knows about breaking codes, which amounts to everything that the United States of America knows. At any moment it could have been annihilated if a janitor had stepped into the room for a few minutes and tidied the place up. Understanding this, Commander Schoen's colleagues in the officers' ranks of Station Hypo have devised strenuous measures to prevent any type of tidying or hygienic operations, of any description, in the entire wing of the building that contains Commander Schoen's office. They know enough, in other words, to understand that the Cryptonomicon is terribly important, and they have the wit to take the measures necessary to keep it safe. Some of them actually consult it from time to time, and use its wisdom to break Nipponese messages, or even solve whole cryptosystems. But Waterhouse is the first guy to come along who is good enough to (at first) point out errors in what Schoen has written, and (soon) assemble the contents of the pile into something like an orderly work, and (eventually) add original material onto it.

*``Hypo'' is a military way of saying the letter H. Bright boy Waterhouse infers that there must be at least seven others: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, etc.

At some point Schoen takes him downstairs and leads him to the end of a long windowless corridor to a slab of a door guarded by hulking Myrmidons and lets him see the second coolest thing they've got at Pearl Harbor, a roomful of machinery from the Electrical Till Corporation that they use mainly for doing frequency counts on Nip intercepts.

The most remarkable machine* at Station Hypo, however--and the first coolest thing in Pearl Harbor--is even deeper in the cloaca of the building. It is contained in something that might be likened to a bank vault if it weren't all wired up with explosives so that its contents can be vaporized in the event of a total Nip invasion.

*Assuming, provisionally, that Alan is wrong and that human brains are not machines.

This is the machine that Commander Schoen made, more than a year ago, for breaking the Nipponese cipher called Indigo. Apparently, as of the beginning of 1940, Schoen was a well-adjusted and mentally healthy young man into whose lap was dumped some great big long lists of numbers compiled from intercept stations around the Pacific (perhaps, Waterhouse thinks, Alpha, Bravo, etc.). These numbers were Nipponese messages that had been encrypted somehow--circumstantial evidence suggested that it had been done by some kind of machine. But absolutely nothing was known about the machine: whether it used gears or rotary switches or plugboards, or some combination thereof, or some other kind of mechanism that hadn't even been thought of by white people yet; how many such mechanisms it did or didn't use; specific details of how it used them. All that could be said was that these numbers, which seemed completely random, had been transmitted, perhaps even incorrectly. Other than that, Schoen had nothing--nothing--to work on.

As of the middle of 1941, then, this machine existed in this vault, here at Station Hypo. It existed because Schoen had built it. The machine perfectly decrypted every Indigo message that the intercept stations picked up, and was, therefore, necessarily an exact functional duplication of the Nipponese Indigo code machine, though neither Schoen nor any other American had ever laid eyes on one. Schoen had built the thing simply by looking at those great big long lists of essentially random numbers, and using some process of induction to figure it out. Somewhere along the line he had become totally debilitated psychologically, and begun to suffer nervous breakdowns at the rate of about one every week or two.

As of the actual outbreak of war with Nippon, Schoen is on disability, and taking lots of drugs. Waterhouse spends as much time with Schoen as he is allowed to, because he's pretty sure that whatever happened inside of Schoen's head, between when the lists of apparently random numbers were dumped into his lap and when he finished building his machine, is an example of a noncomputable process.

Waterhouse's security clearance is upgraded about once a month, until it reaches the highest conceivable level (or so he thinks) which is Ultra/Magic. Ultra is what the Brits call the intelligence they get from having broken the German Enigma machine. Magic is what the Yanks call the intelligence they get from Indigo. In any case, Lawrence now gets to see the Ultra/Magic summaries, which are bound documents with dramatic, alternating red and black paragraphs printed on the front cover. Paragraph number three states:

NO ACTION IS TO BE TAKEN ON INFORMATION HEREIN REPORTED, REGARDLESS OF TEMPORARY ADVANTAGE, IF SUCH ACTION MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF REVEALING THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOURCE TO THE ENEMY.

Seems clear enough, right? But Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse is not so damn sure.

. . . IF SUCH ACTION MIGHT HAVE THE EFFECT OF REVEALING . . .

At about the same time, Waterhouse has made a realization about himself. He has found that he works best when he is not horny, which is to say in the day or so following ejaculation. So as a part of his duty to the United States he has begun to spend a lot of time in whorehouses. But he can't have that much actual sex on what is still a glockenspiel player's pay and so he limits himself to what are euphemistically called massages.

. . . ACTION. . . EFFECT . . .REVEALING . . .

The words stay with him like the clap. He lies on his back during these massages, arms crossed over his eyes, mumbling the words to himself. Something bothers him. He has learned that when something bothers him in this particular way it usually leads to his writing a new paper. But first he has to do a lot of hard mental pick-and-shovel work.

It all comes to him, explosively, during the Battle of Midway, while he and his comrades are spending twenty-four hours a day down among those ETC machines, decrypting Yamamoto's messages, telling Nimitz exactly where to find the Nip fleet.

What are the chances of Nimitz finding that fleet by accident? That's what Yamamoto must be asking himself.

It is all a question (oddly enough!) of information theory.

. . .ACTION . . .

What is an action? It might be anything. It might be something obvious like bombing a Nipponese military installation. Everyone would agree that this would constitute an action. But it might also be something like changing the course of an aircraft carrier by five degrees--or not doing so. Or having exactly the right package of forces off Midway to hammer the Nipponese invasion fleet. It could mean something much less dramatic, like canceling plans for an action. An action, in a certain sense, might even be the total absence of activity. Any of these might be rational responses, on the part of some commander, to INFORMATION HEREIN REPORTED. But any of them might be observable by the Nipponese--and hence any of them would impart information to the Nipponese. How good might those Nips be at abstracting information from a noisy channel? Do they have any Schoens?

. . . EFFECT . . .

So what if the Nips did observe it? What would the effect be exactly? And under what circumstances might the effect be REVEALING THE EXISTENCE OF THE SOURCE TO THE ENEMY?

If the action is one that could never have happened unless the Americans were breaking Indigo, then it will constitute proof, to the Nipponese, that the Americans have broken it. The existence of the source--the machine that Commander Schoen built--will be revealed.

Waterhouse trusts that no Americans will be that stupid. But what if it isn't that clear-cut? What if the action is one that would merely be really improbable unless the Americans were breaking the code? What if the Americans, in the long run, are just too damn lucky?

And how closely can you play that game? A pair of loaded dice that comes up sevens every time is detected in a few throws. A pair that comes up sevens only one percent more frequently than a straight pair is harder to detect--you have to throw the dice many more times in order for your opponent to prove anything.

If the Nips keep getting ambushed--if they keep finding their own ambushes spoiled--if their merchant ships happen to cross paths with American subs more often than pure probability would suggest--how long until they figure it out?

Waterhouse writes papers on the subject, keeps pestering people with them. Then, one day, Waterhouse receives a new set of orders.

The orders arrive encrypted into groups of five random-looking letters, printed out on the blue tissue paper that is used for top-secret cablegrams. The message has been encrypted in Washington using a one-time pad, which is a slow and awkward but, in theory, perfectly unbreakable cipher used for the most important messages. Waterhouse knows this because he is one of the only two persons in Pearl Harbor who has clearance to decrypt it. The other one is Commander Schoen, and he is under sedation today. The duty officer opens up the appropriate safe and gives him the one-time pad for the day, which is basically a piece of graph paper covered with numbers printed in groups of five. The numbers have been chosen by secretaries in a basement in Washington by shuffling cards or drawing chits out of a hat. They are pure noise. One copy of the pure noise is in Waterhouse's hands, and the other copy is used by the person who encrypted this message in Washington.

Waterhouse sits down and gets to work, subtracting noise from ciphertext to produce plaintext.

The first thing he sees is that this message's classification is not merely Top Secret, or even Ultra, but something entirely new: ULTRA MEGA.

The messages states that after thoroughly destroying this message, he--Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse--is to proceed to London, England, by the fastest available means. All ships, trains, and airplanes, even submarines, will be made available to him. Though a member of the U.S. Navy, he is even to be provided with an extra uniform--an Army uniform--in case it simplifies matters for him.

The one thing he must never, ever do is place himself in a situation where he could be captured by the enemy. In this sense, the war is suddenly over for Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse.1Embed"

Tuskin tunnen häntä ja kuitenkin
Tulin häntä tapaamaan
Hän on niin kovin kaunis vieläkin
Kun kääntyy minua katsomaan

Tämä yö on minulle viimeinen
Kuulen hänen sanovan
Olen sairas ja väsynyt ihminen
Ja siksi lähteä haluan

[Chorus 1]
Sinä tiedät jo jotakin elämästä
Jotain tiedän minäkin
Kun vain uskallat lakata pelkäämästä
Paratiisin saat takaisin

[Verse 2]
Hän vielä jatkaa kyynelet silmissään
Sanaa jokaista painottaen
Hän pitää kättäni tiukasti kädessään
Ja sanoo silmiin katsoen:

En kadu ketään niistä, joita syliini suljin
Heitä sentään rakastin
Itken kaikkia niitä
Joiden ohitse kuljin
Joita väistin ja pakenin

And my luminous sword hungers for more

Sheltered inside from the cold of the snow
Follow me now to the vault down below
Drinking the wine as we laugh at the time
Which is passing incredibly slow
(What are these chains that are binding my arms)
Part of you dies each passing day
(Say it's a game and I'll come to no harm)
You'll feel your life slipping away
You who are rich and whose troubles are few
May come around to see my point of view
What price the crown of a King on his throne
When you're chained in the dark all alone
(Spare me my life only name your reward)
Part of you dies each brick I lay

Let's do it

[Verse 1]
Workin' all week 9 to 5 for my money
So when the weekend comes I go get live with the honey
Rollin' down the street I saw this girl and she was pumpin'
I winked my eye she got into the ride , went to a club, was jumpin'
Introduce myself as Loc she said ""You're a liar""
I said ""I got it goin' on baby doll and I'm on fire""
Took her to the hotel she said ""You're the king?""
I said ""Be my queen if you know what I mean and let us do the wild thing""

[Verse 2]
Shoppin' at the mall looking for some gear to buy
I saw this girl she cool rocked my world and I had to adjust my fly
She looked at me and smiled and said ""You have plans for the night?""
I said ""Hopefully if things go well I'll be with you tonight""
So we journeyed to her house one thing led to another
I keyed the door we cold hit the floor looked up and it was her mother
I didn't know what to say I was hanging by a string
She said ""Hey you two I was once like you and I liked to do the wild thing""

Saw this luscious little frame, I ain't lyin' fellas she was fine
The sweet young miss cold gave me a kiss and I knew that she was mine
Took her to the limousine still parked outside
I tipped the chauffeur when it was over and I gave her my own ride
Couldn't get her off my jock she was like static cling
But that's what happens when bodies start slappin' from doin' the wild thing

Doin' a little show at the local discotheque
This fine young chick was on my jock so I say what the heck
She wanted to come on stage and do her little dance
So I said chill for now but maybe later you'll get your chance
So when the show was finished I took her around the way
And what do you know she was good to go without a word to say
We was all alone and she said, ""Tone, let me tell you one thing
I need $50 to make you holler, I get paid to do the wild thing""

Her daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer

Her daddy came out waving that twelve gauge
We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate

By the county line the cops were nipping on our heels
Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel
Shut off the lights and tore through the corn field

Out the other side she was hollering faster
Took a dirt road and had the radio blasting
Hit the honky tonk for a little close dancing

INT. BAR √ NIGHT

A smoky cocktail bar downtown Detroit.

CLARENCE WORLEY, a young hipster hepcat, is trying to pick up an older
lady named LUCY. She isn't bothered by him, in fact, she's alittle charmed. But,
you can tell, that she isn't going to leave her barstool.

CLARENCE
In ""Jailhouse Rock"" he's everything rockabilly's about. I mean he is
rockabilly: mean, surly, nasty, rude. In that movie he couldn't give a fuck
about anything except rockin' and rollin', livin' fast, dyin' young, and
leaving a good-looking corpse. I love that scene where after he's made it big
he's throwing a big cocktail party, and all these highbrows are there, and
he's singing, ""Baby You're So Square... Baby, I Don't Care"". Now, they got
him dressed like a dick. He's wearing these stupid-lookin' pants, this
horrible sweater. Elvis ain't no sweater boy. I even think they got him
wearin' penny loafers. Despite all that shit, all the highbrows at the party,
big house, the stupid clothes, he's still a rude-lookin' motherfucker. I'd
watch that hillbilly and I'd want to be him so bad. Elvis looked good. I'm
no fag, but Elvis was good-lookin'. He was fuckin' prettier than most
women. I always said if I ever had to fuck a guy... I mean had too cause my
life depended on it... I'd fuck Elvis.

The sounds of the city flow in through an open window: car horns, gun shots
and violence. Paint is peeling off the walls and the once green carpet is stained
black.

On the bed nearby is a huge open suitcase filled with clear plastic bags of

suitcase. On the far end of the room, against the wall, is a TV. ""Bewitched"" is
playing.

At the opposite end of the room, by the front, is a table. DREXL SPIVEY and

bags and a weigher. Floyd is black, Drexl is a white boy, though you wouldn't

pussy-eatin' mugs. Now if a nigger wants to get his dick sucked he's got to
do a bunch of fucked-up shit.

BIG D
So you do eat pussy!

FLOYD
Naw naw!

BIG D
You don't like it, but you eat that shit.
(to Drexl)
He eats it.

DREXL
Damn skippy. He like it, too.

BIG D
(mock English accent)
Me thinketh he doth protest too much.

FLOYD
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!

DREXL
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question.
You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch √ you're with
Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say ""Bitch, suck my
dick!"" and then Jayne Kennedy says, ""First things first, nigger, I ain't
suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!"" Now, what
do you say?

FLOYD
I tell Jayne Kennedy, ""Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!""

BIG D
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne
County so fast √

DREXL
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.

FLOYD
I'd say fuck it!

Drexl and Big D get up from the table disgusted and walk away, leaving Floyd
sitting all alone.

Big D sits on the bed, his back turned to Floyd, watching ""Bewitched"".

FLOYD
(yelling after them)
Ain't no man have to eat pussy!

BIG D
(not even looking)
Take that shit somewhere else.

DRXL
(marching back)
You tell Jayne Kennedy to fuck it?

FLOYD
If it came down to who eats who, damn skippy.

DREXL
With that terrible mug of yours if Jayne Kennedy told you to eat her pussy,
kiss her ass, lick her feet, chow on her shit, and suck her dog's dick, nigger,
you'd aim to please.

BIG D
(glued on TV)
I'm hip.

DREXL
In fact, I'm gonna show you what I mean with a little demonstration. Big D,
toss me that shotgun.

Without turning away from ""Bewitched"" he picks up the shotgun and tosses it to
Drexl.

DREXL
(to Floyd)
All right, check this out.
(referring to shotgun)
Now, pretend this is Jayne Kennedy. And you're you.

Then, in a blink, he points the shotgun at Floyd and blows him away.

Big D leaps off the bed and spins toward Drexl.

Drexl, waiting for him, fires from across the room.

The blast hits the big man in the right arm and shoulder, spinning him around.

Drexl makes a beeline for his victim and fires again.

Big D is hit with a blast, full in the back. He slams into the wall and drops.

Drexl collects the suitcase full of cocaine and leaves. As he gets to the front
door he surveys the carnage, spits and walks out.

EXT. CLIFF'S MOVING CAR √ MORNING

A big white Chevy Nova is driving down the road with a sunrise sky as a
backdrop. The song ""Little Bitty Tear"" is heard a capella.

INT. CLIFF'S MOVING CAR √ MORNING

CLIFF WORLEY is driving his car home from work, singing this song gently
to the sunrise. He's a forty-five-years-old ex-cop, at present a security guard. In
between singing he takes sips from a cup of take-out coffee. He's dressed in a
security guard uniform.

EXT. TRAILER PARK √ MORNING

Cliff's Nova pulls in as he continues crooning. He pulls up to his trailer to see
something that stops him short.

CLIFF'S POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD

Clarence and a nice-looking YOUNG WOMAN are watching for him in front
of his trailer.

CLOSEUP √ CLIFF

Upon seeing Clarence, a little bitty tear rolls down Cliff's cheek.

BACK TO:

CLIFF'S POV

Clarence and the Young Woman walk over to the car. Clarence sticks his face
through the driver's side window.

CLARENCE
Good Morning, Daddy. Long time no see.

INT. TRAILER HOME √ MORNING

All three enter the trailer home.

CLIFF
Excuse the place, I haven't been entertaining company as of late. Sorry if
I'm acting a little dense, but you're the last person in the world I expected
to see this morning.

Clarence and the Young Girl walk into the living room.

CLARENCE
Yeah, well, tha's OK, Daddy, I tend to have that effect on people. I'm dyin'
on thirst, you got anything to drink?

He moves past Cliff and heads straight for his refridgerator.

CLIFF
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.

CLARENCE
(rumaging around the fridge)
Anything stronger?
(pause)
Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?

CLIFF
I can, but I don't.

CLARENCE
(closing the fridge)
That's about all I ever eat.

Cliff looks at the Girl. She smiles sweetly at him.

CLIFF
(to Girl)
I'm sorry... I'm his father.

YOUNG GIRL
(sticking her hand out)
That's OK, I'm his wife.
(shaking his hand vigorously)
Alabama Worley, pleased to meetcha.

She is really pumping his arm, just like a used-car salesman. However, that's
where the similarities end; Alabama's totally sincere.

Clarence steps back into the living room, holding a bunch of little ceramic fruit
magnets in his hand. He throws his other arm around Alabama.

CLARENCE
Oh yeah, we got married.
(referring to the magnets)
You still have these.
(to Alabama)
This isn't a complete set; when I was five I swallowed the pomegranate one.
I never shit it out, so I guess it's still there. Loverdoll, why don't you be a
sport and go get us some beer. I want some beer.
(to Cliff)
Do you want some beer? Well, if you want some it's here.

He hands her some money and his car keys.

CLARENCE
Go to the liquor store √
(to Cliff)
Where is there a liquor store around here?

CLIFF
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.

CLARENCE
(to Alabama)
Get a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get
cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if
not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look,
since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a
foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?

ALABAMA
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-
Dongs.

CLARENCE
Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good.
(to Cliff)
What do you think would taste good?

CLIFF
I'm really not very √

CLARENCE
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a
while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer,
definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.
(to Cliff)
Where's a good chicken place around here?

CLIFF
I really don't know.

CLARENCE
You don't know the chicken places around where you live?
(to Alabama)
Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.

He gives her some more money.

CLARENCE
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.

ALABAMA
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.

She opens the door and starts out. Clarence turns to his dad as the door shuts.

CLARENCE
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is
she a four alarm fire, or what?

CLIFF
She seems very nice.

CLARENCE
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only
word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in
love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's
written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we
gotta talk √

CLIFF
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how
much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and
through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a
sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn
bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down.
Now, when did you get married?

CLARENCE
Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help.

BLACK TITLE CARD: ""HOLLYWOOD""

INT. OUTSIDE OF CASTING DIRECTOR'S OFFICER √ DAY

FOUR YOUNG ACTORS are sitting on a couch with sheets of paper in their
hands silently mouthing lines. One of the actors is DICK RITCHIE. The casting
director, MARY LOUISE RAVENCROFT, steps into the waiting room, clip
board in hand.

RAVENCROFT
Dick Ritchie?

Dick pops up from the pack.

DICK
I'm me... I mean, that's me.

RAVENCROFT
Step inside.

INT. CASTING DIRECTOR'S OFFICE √ DAY

She sits behind a large desk. Her name-plate rests on the desktop. Several
posters advertising ""The Return of T.J. Hooker"" hang on the wall.

Dick sits in a chair, holding his sheets in his hands.

RAVENCROFT
Well, the part you're reading for is one of the bad guys. There's Brian and
Marty. Peter Breck's already been cast as Brian. And you're reading for
the part of Marty. Now in this scene you're both in a car and Bill Shatner's
hanging on the hood. And what you're trying to do is get him off.
(she picks a up a copy of the script)
Whenever you're ready.

DICK
(reading and miming driving)
Where'd you come from?

RAVENCROFT
(reading from the script lifelessly)
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.

DICK
(reading from script)
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.

She puts her script down, and smiles at him.

RAVENCROFT
That was very good.

DICK
Thank you.

RAVENCROFT
If we decided on making him a New York type, could you do that?

DICK
Sure. No problem.

RAVENCROFT
Could we try it now?

DICK
Absolutely.

Dick picks up the script and begins, but this time with a Brooklyn accent.

DICK
Where'd he come from?

RAVENCROFT
(monotone, as before)
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.

DICK
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.

Ravencroft puts her script down.

RAVENCROFT
Well, Mr. Ritchie, I'm impressed. You're a very fine actor.

Dick smiles.

INT. TRAILER HOME √ DAY

Cliff's completely aghast. He just stares, unable to come to grips with what
Clarence has told him.

CLARENCE
Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel
free.

CLIFF
You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes.
Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a
joke about this √
(raising his voice)
√ I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!

Cliff pauses and collects himself.

CLIFF
What do you want from me?

CLARENCE
What?

CLIFF
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in
some way. What do you need from me? You need money?

CLARENCE
Do you still have friends on the force?

CLIFF
Yes, I still have friends on the force.

CLARENCE
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit
about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for
sure what's goin' on.
(pause)
Daddy?

CLIFF
What makes you think I could do that?

CLARENCE
You were a cop.

CLIFF
What makes you think I would do that?

CLARENCE
I'm your son.

CLIFF
You got it all worked out, don't you?

CLARENCE
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to
make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced
you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a
year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always ""OK"",
""No problem"", ""You're a busy guy, I understand"". The whole time you
were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No!
Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad
parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm
basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask.
And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.

Alabama walks in through the door carrying a shopping bag.

ALABAMA
The forager's back.

CLARENCE
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.

ALABAMA
I didn't get any chicken.

CLARENCE
How come?

ALABAMA
It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.

INT. TRAILER HOME √ BEDROOM √ DAY

Cliff's on the telephone in his bedroom, pacing as he talks. The living room od
the trailer can be seen from his doorway, where Clarence and Alabama are
horsing around. They giggle and cut up throughout the scene. As Cliff talks, all
the noise and hubbub of a police station comes through over the line. He's
talking to DETECTIVE WILSON, an old friend of his from the force.

We see both inside the conversation.

CLIFF
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.

WILSON
What about him?

CLIFF
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it
might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible
for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.

WILSON
Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?

CLIFF
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in
for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while
I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?

WILSON
McTeague.

CLIFF
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?

WILSON
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?

CLIFF
You and Robin moved?

WILSON
Shit, are you behind. Me and Robin got a divorce six months ago. Got
myself a new place √ mirrors all over the bedroom, ceiling fans above the
bed. Guy'd have to look as ugly as King Kong not to get laid in this place.
I'm serious, a guy'd have to look like a gorilla.

CUT TO:

EXT. TRAILER HOME √ DAY

Clarence and Cliff stand by Clarence's 1965 red Mustang. Alabama's amusing
herself by doing cartwheels and handstands in the background.

CLIFF
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.

CLARENCE
Do tell. Why drug related?

CLIFF
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.

CLARENCE
No shit?

CLIFF
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name
mean anything to you?

CLARENCE
Nope.

CLIFF
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.

CLARENCE
Who is he?

CLIFF
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look,
Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did
the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.

CLARENCE
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops
aren't looking for me?

CLIFF
Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou
had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.

Clarence sticks his hand out to shake. Cliff takes it.

CLARENCE
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.

CLIFF
I got some money I can give you √

CLARENCE
Keep it.

CLIFF
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and
Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.

CLARENCE
We do make a cute couple, don't we?

CLIFF
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about.
Quit fuckin' around.
(pause)
I love you son.

They hug each other,

Clarence takes a pice of paper out and puts it into Cliff's hand.

CLARENCE
This is Dick's number in Hollywood. We don't know where we'll be, but
you can get a hold of me through him.

Clarence turns toward Alabama and yells to her.

CLARENCE
Bama, we're outta here. Kiss Pops goodbye,

Alabama runs across from where she was and throws her arms around Cliff
and gives him a big smackeroo on the lips. Cliff's a little startled. Alabama's
bubbling like a Fresca.

ALABAMA
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.

CLARENCE
(mock anger)
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?

ALABAMA
Oh, hush up.

The two get into the Mustang.

CLARENCE
(to Cliff)
We'll send you a postcard as soon as we get to Hollywood.

Clarence starts the engine. The convertible roof opens as they talk.

CLIFF
Bama, you take care of that one for me. Keep him out of trouble.

ALABAMA
Don't worry, Daddy, I'm keepin' this fella on a short leash.

Clarence, slowly, starts driving away.

CLARENCE
(to Cliff)
As the sun sets slowly in the west we bid a fond farewell to all the friends
we've made... and, with a touch of melancholy, we look forward to the time
when we will all be together again.

Clarence peels out, shooting a shower of gravel up in the air.

As the Mustang disappears Cliff runs his tongue over his lips.

CLIFF
The-son-of-a-bitch was right... she does taste like a peach.

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT √ DAY

Dick's apartment is standard issue for a young actor. Things are pretty neat
and clean. A nice stereo unit sits on the shelf. A framed picture of a ballet
dancer's feet hangs on the wall.

The phone rings, Dick answers.

DICK
Hi, Dick here.

INT. HOTEL SUITE √ LAS VEGAS √ SUNSET

Top floor, Las Vegas, Nevada hotel room with a huge picture window
overlooking the neon-filled strip and the flaming red and orange sunset sky.

Clarence paces up and down with the telephone in his hand.

CLARENCE
(big bopper voice)
Heeeellllloooo baaaabbbbbyyyy!!!

Note: We intercut both sides of the conversation.

DICK
(unsure)
Clarence?

CLARENCE
You got it.

DICK
It's great to hear from you.

CLARENCE
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.

DICK
You comin' to L.A.? When?

CLARENCE
Tomorrow.

DICK
What's up? Why're leavin' Detroit?

Clarence sits down on the hotel room bed. Alabama, wearing only a long T-
shirt with a big picture of Bullwinkle on it, crawls behind him.

CLARENCE
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way,
I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.

DICK
Get the fuck outta here!

CLARENCE
I'm married man.

DICK
Get the fuck outta here!

CLARENCE
Believe it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm
not quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it.
Wanna say hi to my better half?

Before Dick can respond Clarence puts Alabama on the phone.

ALABAMA
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.

DICK
Hello, Alabama.

ALABAMA
I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were
his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.

Clarence start dictating to her what to say.

CLARENCE
Tell him we gotta go.

ALABAMA
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.

DICK
What?

CLARENCE
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.

ALABAMA
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.

DICK
Wait a minute √

CLARENCE
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.

ALABAMA
Don't eat anything.

DICK
Alabama, could you tell Clar √

CLARENCE
Ask him if he got the letter.

ALABAMA
Did you get the letter?

DICK
What letter?

ALABAMA
(to Clarence)
What letter?

CLARENCE
The letter I sent.

ALABAMA
(to Dick)
The letter he sent.

DICK
Clarence sent a letter?

CLARENCE
Has he gotten his mail today?

ALABAMA
Gotten your mail yet?

DICK
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.

ALABAMA
(to Clarence)
Yes.

CLARENCE
Has he looked through it yet?

ALABAMA
(to Dick)
Ya looked through it?

DICK
Not yet.

ALABAMA
(to Clarence)
Nope.

CLARENCE
Tell him to look through it.

ALABAMA
(to Dick)
Get it.

DICK
Let me speak to Clarence.

ALABAMA
(to Clarence)
He wants to speak with you.

CLARENCE
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all.
Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems
are over.

ALABAMA
(to Dick)
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter
explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to
know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.

DICK
Money problems?

CLARENCE
Now tell him goodbye.

ALABAMA
Bye-bye.

CLARENCE
Now hang up.

She hangs up the phone.

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT √ DAY

Dick hears the click on the other end.

DICK
Hello, hello, Clarence? Clarence's wife?... I mean Alabama... hello?

Extremely confused, Dick jangs up the phone. He goes over to the TV and picks
up the day's mail. He goes through it.

BILL: Southern California Gas Company.

BILL: Group W.

BILL: Fossenkemp Photography.

BILL: Columbia Record and Tape Club.

LETTER: It's obviously from Clarence. Addressed to Dick. Dick opens it.

EXT. TRAILER √ DAY

A lower-middle-class trailer park named Astro World, which has a neon sign in
front of it in the shape of a planet.

A big, white Chevy Nova pulls into the park. It parks by a trailer that's slightly
less kept up than the others. Cliff gets out of the Chevy. He's drinking out of a
fast-food soda cup as he opens the door to his trailer.

INT. TRAILER √ DAY

He steps inside the doorway and then, before he knows it, a gun is pressed to
his temple and a big hand grabs his shoulder.

GUN CARRIER (DARIO)
Welcome home, alchy. We're havin' a party.

Cliff is roughly shoved into his living room. Waiting for him are four men,
standing: VIRGIL, FRANKIE (young Wise-guy) LENNY (an old Wise-guy),
and TOOTH-PICK VIC (a fireplug pitbull type).

Sitting in Cliff's recliner is VINCENZO COCCOTTI, the Frank Nitti to Detroid
mob leader Blue Lou Boyle.

Cliff is knocked to his knees. He looks up and sees the sitting Coccotti. Dario
and Lenny pick him up and roughly drop him in a chair.

COCCOTTI
(to Frankie)
Tell Tooth-pick Vic to go outside and do you-know-what.

In Italian Frankie tells Tooth-pick Vic what Coccotti said. He nods and exits.

Cliff's chair is moved closer to Coccotti's. Dario stands on one side of Cliff.
Frankie and Lenny ransack the trailer. Virgil has a bottle of Chivas Regal in his
hand, but he has yet to touch a drop.

COCCOTTI
Do you know who I am, Mr. Worley?

CLIFF
I give up. Who are you?

COCCOTTI
I'm the Anti-Christ. You get me in a vendetta kind of mood, you will tell
the angels in heaven that you had never seen pure evil so singularly
personified as you did in the face of the man who killed you. My name is
Vincenzo Coccotti. I work as a counsel for Mr. Blue Lou Boyle, the man
your son stole from. I hear you were once a cop so I assume you've heard
of us before. Am I correct?

CLIFF
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.

COCCOTTI
I'm glad. Hopefully that will clear up the how-full-of-shit-I-am question
you've been asking yourself. Now, we're gonna have a little Q and A, and,
at the risk of sounding redundant, please make your answers genuine.
(taking out a pack of Chesterfields)
Want a Chesterfield?

CLIFF
No.

COCCOTTI
(as he lights up)
I have a son of my own. About you boy's age. I can imagine how painful
this must be for you. But Clarence and that bitch-whore girlfriend of his
brought this all on themselves. And I implore you not to go down the road
with 'em. You can always take comfort in the fact that you never had a
choice.

CLIFF
Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence √

Before Cliff can finish his sentence, Coccotti slams him hard in the nose with
his fist.

COCCOTTI
Smarts, don't it? Gettin' slammed in the nose fucks you all up. You got that
pain shootin' through your brain. Your eyes fill up with water. It ain't any
kind of fun. But what I have to offer you. That's as good as it's ever gonna
get, and it won't ever get that good again. We talked to your neighbors.
They saw a Mustang, a red Mustang, Clarence's red Mustang, parked in
front of your trailer yesterday. Mr. Worley, have you seen your son?

Cliff's defeated.

CLIFF
I've seen him.

COCCOTTI
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance
you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore
your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't
just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity.
Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do
some business, cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room
blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.

CLIFF
What are you talkin' about?

COCCOTTI
I'm talkin' about a massacre. They snatched my narcotics and hightailed it
outta there. Wouldda gotten away with it, but your son, fuckhead that he is,
left his driver's license in a dead guy's hand. A whore hiding in the
commode filled in all the blanks.

CLIFF
I don't believe you.

COCCOTTI
That's of minor importance. But what's of major fuckin' importance is that
I believe you. Where did they go?

CLIFF
On their honeymoon.

COCCOTTI
I'm gettin' angry askin' the same question a second time. Where did they
go?

CLIFF
They didn't tell me.

Coccotti looks at him.

CLIFF
Now, wait a minute and listen. I haven't seen Clarence in three years.
Yesterday he shows up here with a girl, sayin' he got married. He told me
he needed some quick cash for a honeymoon, so he asked if he could
borrow five hundred dollars. I wanted to help him out so I wrote out a
check. We went to breakfast and that's the last I saw of him. So help me
God. They never thought to tell me where they were goin'. And I never
thought to ask.

Coccotti looks at him for a long moment. He then gives Virgil a look. Virgil,
quick as greased lightning, grabs Cliff's hand and turns it palm up. He then
whips out a butterfly knife and slices Cliff's palm open and pours Chivas Regal
on the wound. Cliff screams.

Coccotti puffs on a Chesterfield.

Tooth-pic Vic returns to the trailer, and reports in Italian that there's nothing in
the car.

Virgil walks into the kitchen and gets a dishtowel. Cliff holds his bleeding palm
in agony. Virgil hands him the dishtowel. Cliff uses it to wrap up his hand.

COCCOTTI
Sicilians are great liars. The best in the world. I'm a Sicilian. And my old
man was the world heavyweight champion of Sicilian liars. And from
growin' up with him I learned the pantomime. Now there are seventeen
different things a guy can do when he lies to give him away. A guy has
seventeen pantomimes. A woman's got twenty, but a guy's got seventeen.
And if you know 'em like ya know your own face, they beat lie detectors to
hell. What we got here is a little game of show and tell. You don't wanna
show me nothin'. But you're tellin' me everything. Now I know you know
where they are. So tell me, before I do some damage you won't walk away
from.

The awful pain in Cliff's hand is being replaced by the awful pain in his heart.
He looks deep into Coccotti's eyes.

CLIFF
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?

COCCOTTI
Sure.

Coccotti leans over and hands him a smoke.

CLIFF
Got a match?

Cliff reaches into his pocket and pulls out a lighter.

CLIFF
Oh, don't bother. I got one.
(he lights the cigarette)
So you're a Sicilian, huh?

COCCOTTI
(intensly)
Uh-huh.

CLIFF
You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find
that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians
were spawned by niggers.

All the men stop what they were doing and look at Cliff, except for Tooth-pic
Vic who doesn't speak English and so isn't insulted. Coccotti can't believe what
he's hearing.

COCCOTTI
Come again?

CLIFF
It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you
don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago
the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then,
Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But,
once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did
so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for
ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it
absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later,
Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's
written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-
grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a
fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?

Coccotti looks at him for a moment then jumps up, whips out an automatic,
grabs hold of Cliff's hair, puts the barrel to his temple, and pumps three bullets
through Cliff's head.

He pushes the body violently aside. Coccotti pauses. Unable to express his
feelings and frustrated by the blood in his hands, he simply drops his weapon,
and turns to his men.

COCCOTTI
I haven't killed anybody since 1974. Goddamn his soul to burn for eternity
in fuckin' hell for makin' me spill blood on my hands! Go to this
comedian's son's apartment and come back with somethin' that tells me
where that asshole went so I can wipe this egg off of my face and fix this
fucked-up family for good.

Tooth-pick Vic taps Frankie's shoulder and, in Italianm asks him what that was
all about.

Lenny, who has been going through Cliff's refridgerator, has found a beer.
When he closes the refridgerator door he finds a note held on by a ceramic
banana magnet that says: ""Clarence in L.A.: Dick Ritchie (number and
address)"".

LENNY
Boss, get ready to get happy.

TITLE CARD: ""CLARENCE AND ALABAMA HIT L.A.""

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT √ MORNING

Dick's asleep in a recliner. He's wearing his clothes from the night before. His
room-mate FLOYD is lying on the sofa watching TV.

The sound of our hands knocking on his door wakes Dick up. He shakes the
bats out of his belfry, opens the door, and finds the cutest couple in Los Angeles
standing in his doorway.

Clarence and Alabama immediately start singing ""Hello My Baby"" like the frog
in the old Chuck Jones cartoon.

CLARENCE/ALABAMA
Hello my baby,
Hello my honey,
Hello my ragtime gal √

DICK
Hi guys.

Alabama throws her arms around Dick, and gives him a quick kiss. After she
breaks, Clarence does the same. Clarence and Alabama walk right past Dick
and into his apartment.

CLARENCE
Wow. Neat place.

INT. PINK'S HOT-DOG STAND √ DAY

The Pink's employees work like skilled Benihana chefs as they assemble the
ultimate masterpiece hot-dog.

EXT. PINK'S HOT-DOG STAND √ PATIO √ DAY

Clarence, Alabama, and Dick are sitting at an outdoor table chowing down on
chili dogs. Alabama is in the middle of a story.

ALABAMA
... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid
before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished,
crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and
my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow
zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus
appears, and the bus-driver says, ""Get her in here."". He forgot all about his
route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice
guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well,
his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da
been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was
from. And, so there you go.

CLARENCE
And here we are.

DICK
That's a pretty amazing story.

CLARENCE
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?

DICK
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.

CLARENCE
You goin' out?

DICK
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my
acting class.

CLARENCE
Good for you.

DICK
What's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head
bunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional
instability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a
really good reading for ""T.J. Hooker"" the other day.

ALABAMA
You're gonna be on ""T.J. Hooker""?

DICK
Knock wood.

He knocks the table and then looks at it.

DICK
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.

CLARENCE
Did you meet Captain Kirk?

DICK
You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.

ALABAMA
(finishing her hot-dog)
That was so good I am gonna have another.

DICK
You can't have just one.

Alabama leaves to get another hot-dog. Clarence never takes his eyes off her.

DICK
How much of that letter was on the up and up?

CLARENCE
Every word of it.

Dick sees where Clarence's attention is.

DICK
You're really in love, aren't you?

CLARENCE
For the very first time in my life.
(pause)
Do you know what that's like?

Clarence is so intense Dick doesn't know how to answer.

DICK
(regretfully)
No, I don't
(he looks at Alabama)
How did you two meet?

Clarence leans back thoughtfully and takes a sip from his Hebrew cream soda.

CLARENCE
Do you remember The Lyric?

INT. THE LYRIC THEATER √ NIGHT

Sonny Chiba, as ""Streetfighter"" Terry Surki, drives into a group of guys, fists
and feet flying and whips ass on the silver screen.

Clarence sits, legs over the back of the chair in front of him, nibbling on
popcorn, eyes big as sourcers, and a big smile on his face.

EXT. THE LYRIC THEATER √ NIGHT

A cab pulls up to the outside of The Lyric. The marquee carries the names of the
triple feature: ""The Streetfighter"", ""Return of the Streetfighter"" and ""Sister
Streetfighter"". Alabama steps out of the taxi cab and walks up to the box office.

A BOX OFFICE GIRL reading comic looks at her.

ALABAMA
One please.

BOX OFFICE GIRL
Ninety-nine cents.

ALABAMA
Which one is on now?

BOX OFFICE GIRL
""Return of the Streetfighter"". It's been on about forty-five minutes.

INT. THE LYRIC THEATER √ LOBBY √ NIGHT

Alabama walks into the lobby and goes over to the concession stand. A
YOUNG USHER takes care of her.

ALABAMA
Can I have a medium popcorn? A super-large Mr. Pibb, and a box of
Goobers.

INT. THE LYRIC THEATER √ NIGHT

It's still assholes and elbows on the screen with Sonny Chiba taking on all-
comers.

Alabama walks through the doors with her bounty of food. She makes a quick
scan of the theater. Not many people are there. She makes a beeline for the
front whick happens to be Clarence's area of choice. She picks the row of seats
just behind Clarence and starts asking her way down it.

Clarence turns and sees this beautiful girl all alone moving towards him. He
turns his attention back to the screen, trying not to be so obvious.

When Alabama gets right behind Clarence, her foot thunks a discarded wine
bottle, causing her to trip and spill her popcorn over Clarence.

ALABAMA
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?

CLARENCE
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.

ALABAMA
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.

CLARENCE
(picking popcorn out of his hair)
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.

ALABAMA
(picking popcorn out of his hair)
What a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You
could have been a real dick.

Alabama sits back in her seat to watch the movie.

Clarence tries to wipe her out of his mind, which isn't easy, and get back into
the movie.

They both watch the screen for a moment. Then, Alabama leans forward and
taps Clarence on the shoulder.

ALABAMA
Excuse me... I hate to bother you again. Would you mind too terribly filling
me in on what I missed?

Jumping on this opportunity.

CLARENCE
Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.

ALABAMA
The oriental.

CLARENCE
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired
to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into
the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while
keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a
number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the
window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.

ALABAMA
Want some Goobers?

CLARENCE
Thanks a lot.

ALABAMA
I thought Sonny was the good guy.

CLARENCE
He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be
bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.

They both watch, eyes wide, as Sonny Chiba kicks asses.

TIME CUT:

On the screen, Sonny Chiba's all jacked up. Dead bodies lie all around him.
THE END (in Japanese) flashes on the screen.

The theater light go up. Alabama's now sitting in the next seat to Clarence.
They're both applauding.

ALABAMA
Great movie. Action-packed!

CLARENCE
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?

ALABAMA
Sonny kicks ass.

CLARENCE
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the ""Streetfighter"". It
was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the
R.

ALABAMA
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.

CLARENCE
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?

ALABAMA
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.

CLARENCE
Is that your real name? Really?

ALABAMA
That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.

She shows Clarence her driver's license.

CLARENCE
Well, cut my legs off and call me Shorty. That's a pretty original moniker
there, Alabama. Sounds like a Pam Grier movie.
(announcer voice)
She's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'! She
carried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her waist,
and the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes! Alabama Whitman is Pam Grier!
Pray for forgiveness, Rated R... for Ruthless Revenge!

EXT. THE LYRIC THEATER √ NIGHT

Clarence and Alabama are outside the theater. With the marquee lit up in the
background they both perform unskilled martial arts moves. Clarence and
Alabama break up laughing.

CLARENCE
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.

ALABAMA
I took a cab.

CLARENCE
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?

ALABAMA
Sure. Why not?

CLARENCE
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.

ALABAMA
What time is it?

CLARENCE
'Bout twelve.

ALABAMA
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?

CLARENCE
No. Not particularly.
(pause)
How come?

ALABAMA
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get
some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after
you've seen a good movie?

CLARENCE
I love to get pie after a movie.

ALABAMA
Would you like to get some pie?

CLARENCE
I'd love some pie.

INT. DENNY'S RESTAURANT √ NIGHT

Clarence and Alabama are sitting in a booth at an all-night Denny's. It's about
12:40 a.m. Clarence is having a piece of chocolate cream pie and a coke.
Alabama's nibbling on a peace of heated apple pie and sipping on a large Tab.

CLARENCE
Well, enough about the King. How about you?

ALABAMA
How 'bout me what?

CLARENCE
Tell me about yourself.

ALABAMA
There's nothing to tell.

CLARENCE
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?

ALABAMA
What do you want to know?

CLARENCE
Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your
favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you
like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's
the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?

Alabama takes a bite of pie, puts down her fork, and looks at Clarence.

ALABAMA
Ask me them again. One by one.

CLARENCE
What do you do?

ALABAMA
I don't remember.

CLARENCE
Where are you from.

ALABAMA
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.

CLARENCE
What's your favorite color?

ALABAMA
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.

CLARENCE
What's your favorite movie star?

ALABAMA
Burt Reynolds.

CLARENCE
Would you like a bite of my pie?

ALABAMA
Yes, I would.

Clarence scoops up a piece on his fork and Alabama bites it off.

CLARENCE
Like it?

ALABAMA
Very much. Now, where were we?

CLARENCE
What kinda music do you like?

ALABAMA
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like ""He's a Rebel"".

CLARENCE
What are your turn-ons?

ALABAMA
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like
Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.

CLARENCE
Turn-offs?

ALABAMA
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only
thing that comes to mind are Persians.

CLARENCE
Do you have a fella?

She looks at Clarence and smiles.

ALABAMA
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.

CLARENCE
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of
town alone?

ALABAMA
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a
form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or
where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even
know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a
Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they
told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on
me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For
some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told
him to stop and I got out.

CLARENCE
And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?

ALABAMA
Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure
couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.

Clarence looks at her closely. He picks up his soda and sucks on the straw until
it makes that slurping sound. He puts it aside and stares into her soul.

A smile cracks on her face and develops into a big wide grin.

ALABAMA
Aren't you just dazzled by my imagination, lover boy?
(eats her last piece of pie)
Where to next?

INT. COMIC BOOK STORE √ NIGHT

It's about 1:30 a.m. Clarence has taken Alabama to where he works. It's a
comic book store called Heroes For Sale. Alabama thinks this place is super-
cool.

ALABAMA
Wow. What a swell place to work.

CLARENCE
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books,
play music.

ALABAMA
How long have you worked here?

CLARENCE
Almost four years.

ALABAMA
That's a long time.

CLARENCE
I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what
I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most
of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.

ALABAMA
Do you get paid a lot?

CLARENCE
That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow
some money if you need it. Wanna see what ""Spiderman"" number one
looks like?

ALABAMA
You bet. How much is that worth?

Clarence gets a box off the shelf.

CLARENCE
Four hundred bucks.

ALABAMA
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.

CLARENCE
Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."" Lunch
boxes. ""Green Hornet"" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are
main business. There's a lot of collectors around here.

She holds up a little GI Joe sized action figure of a black policeman.

ALABAMA
What's that?

CLARENCE
That's a ""Rookies"" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls.
They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors
in ""The Black Hole""? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid
playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.

He pulls a plastic-cased ""Spiderman"" comic form the box.

CLARENCE
""Spiderman"", number one. The one that started it all.

Clarence shows the comic book to Alabama.

ALABAMA
God, Spiderman looks different.

CLARENCE
He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr.
Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just
disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold
on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.

He pulls out another comic.

CLARENCE
""Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos"". One of the coolest series known
to man. They're completely worthless. You can get number one for about
four bucks. But that's one of the cool things about them, they're so cheap.
(he opens one up)
Just look at that artwork, will ya. Great stories. Great Characters. Look at
this one.

We see the ""Sgt. Fury"" panels.

CLARENCE
Nick's gotten a ring from his sweetheart and he wears it around his neck on
a chain. OK, later in the story he gets into a fight with a Nazi bastard on a
ship. He knocks the guy overboard, but the Kraut grabs ahold of his chain
and the ring goes overboard too. So, Nick dives into the ocean to get it. Isn't
that cool?

She's looking into Clarence's eyes. He turns and meets her gaze.

CLARENCE
Alabama, I'd like you to have this.

Clarence hands her the ""Sgt. Fury and His Howling Commandos"" comic book
that he loves so much.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT √ BEDROOM √ NIGHT

Clarence's bedroom is a pop culture explosion. Movie posters, pictures of Elvis,
anything you can imagine. The two walk through the door.

ALABAMA
What a cool room!

She runs and does a jumping somersault into his bed.

Later. Alabama's sitting Indian-style going through Clarence's photo album.
Clarence is behind her planting little kisses on her neck and shoulders.

ALABAMA
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you
then?

CLARENCE
Five.

She turns the page.

ALABAMA
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.

CLARENCE
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.

LATER √ LIVING ROOM

Clarence and Alabama slow dance in the middle of his room to Janis Joplin's
""Piece of My Heart"".

CLARENCE
You know when you sat behind me?

ALABAMA
At the movies?

CLARENCE
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she
doesn't want me bothering her.

ALABAMA
What would make you think that?

CLARENCE
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.

ALABAMA
You're not stupid. Just wrong.

They move to the music. Alabama softly, quietly sings some of the words to the
song.

ALABAMA
I love Janis.

CLARENCE
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.

ALABAMA
She OD'd, didn't she?

CLARENCE
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too
much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what
she took.

ALABAMA
You mean she got a bad batch?

CLARENCE
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the
happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't
trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her
to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she
couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money.
So, she said no. And the guy says, ""Look, I really love you, and I wanna
prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what
happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it."" So she did,
and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her
a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.

ALABAMA
So he really loved her?

CLARENCE
Uh-huh.

They kiss.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT √ BEDROOM √ DAY

It's the next day, around 1 p.m. Clarence wakes up in his bed, alone. He looks
around, and no Alabama. Then he hears crying in the distance. He puts on a
robe and investigates.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT √ LIVING ROOM √ DAY

Alabama's wearing one of Clarence's old shirts. She's curled up in a chair
crying. Clarence approaches her. She tries to compose herself.

CLARENCE
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?

ALABAMA
You didn't do nothing.

CLARENCE
Did you hurt yourself?
(he takes her foot)
Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?

ALABAMA
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the
theater. I was paid to be there.

CLARENCE
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls.
Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.

ALABAMA
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.

Pause.

CLARENCE
You're a whore?

ALABAMA
I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.
(pause)
I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that
comic book place.

CLARENCE
""Heroes For Sale""?

ALABAMA
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.

CLARENCE
Who?

ALABAMA
I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into
you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was
gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I
was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich
millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.

CLARENCE
That dazzling imagination.

ALABAMA
It's over on the TV. All it says is: ""Dear Clarence."" I couldn't write
anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to
ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that
much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, ""Alabama, come clean, Let him
know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to
Drexl and fuck yourself.""

CLARENCE
Who and what is a Drexl?

ALABAMA
My pimp.

CLARENCE
You have a pimp?

ALABAMA
Uh-huh.

CLARENCE
A real live pimp?

ALABAMA
Uh-huh.

CLARENCE
Is he black?

ALABAMA
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.

CLARENCE
Is he nice?

ALABAMA
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty
decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with
Arlene the other day.

CLARENCE
What did he do to Arlene?

ALABAMA
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.

CLARENCE
This motherfucker sounds charming!

Clarence is on his feet, furious.

CLARENCE
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much
longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How
the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first
place?

ALABAMA
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an
agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They
have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-
collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five
hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry
beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in ""Dressed to Kill"". And when I was
ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says
he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's
gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or
wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the
ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last
night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it
was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a
second date.

CLARENCE
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again.
Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went
together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it,
you wanna marry me?

ALABAMA
What?

CLARENCE
Will you be my wife?

When Alabama gives her answer, her voice cracks.

ALABAMA
Yes.

CLARENCE
(a little surprised)
You will?

ALABAMA
You better not be fucking teasing me.

CLARENCE
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.

They seal it with a kiss.

LATER √ THAT NIGHT

CLOSEUP √ Alabama's wedding ring.

The newlyweds are snuggling up together onthe couch watching TV. The movie
they're watching is ""The Incredible One-Armed Boxer vs. the Master of the
Flying Guillotine"". Alabama watches the screen, but every so often she looks
down to admre the ring on her hand.

CLARENCE
Did ya ever see ""The Chinese Professionals""?

ALABAMA
I don't believe so.

CLARENCE
Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the
Incredible One-Armed Boxer.

We hear, off screen, the TV Announcer say:

TV ANNOUNCER
(off)
We'll return to Jimmy Wang Yu in... ""The Incredible One-Armed Boxer
vs. the Master of the Flying Guillotine"", tonight's eight o'clock movie, after
these important messages...

Clarence looks at the TV. He feels the warmth of Alabama's hand holding his.
We see commercials playing.

He turns in her direction. She's absent-mindedly looking at her wedding ring.

He smiles and turns back to the TV.

More commercials.

seen your lovely wife today?

CLARENCE
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.

ALABAMA
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?

Moving on top of her.

CLARENCE
Not for me.

He starts kissing her and moving her down on the seat. She resists.

ALABAMA
(playfully)
No no no no no no no no no...

CLARENCE
(playfully)
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...

You holdin' out on me, girl? Bitch, you never learn!

FLASH ON:

Alabama passionately kissing the uninterested pimp.

PIMP
Hang it up, momma. I got no time for this bullshit.

BACK TO:

TV showing kung fu film.

BACK TO:

Clarence's face. There's definitely something different about his eyes.

Clarence springs off the couch and goes into his bedroom. Alabama's startled
by his sudden movement.

ALABAMA
(yelling after him)
Where you goin', honey?

CLARENCE
(off)
I just gotta get somethin'.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT √ BATHROOM √ NIGHT

Clarence splashes water on his face, trying to wash away the images that keep
polluting his mind. Then, he hears a familiar voice.

FAMILIAR VOICE
(off)
Well? Can you live with it?

Clarence turns and sees that the voice belongs to Elvis Presley. Clarence isn't surprised to see him.

CLARENCE
What?

ELVIS
Can you live with it?

CLARENCE
Live with what?

ELVIS
With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you?
And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?

CLARENCE
Yeah.

ELVIS
You wanna get unhaunted?

CLARENCE
Yeah.

ELVIS
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.

CLARENCE
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.

ELVIS
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.

CLARENCE
You'd really do that?

ELVIS
He don't got no right to live.

CLARENCE
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to
kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.

ELVIS
I don't blame you.

CLARENCE
If I thought I could get away with it √

ELVIS
Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya
think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find
who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole
wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught
at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.

Clarence looks at Elvis.

ELVIS
Clarence, I like ya. Always have, always will.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT √ BEDROOM √ NIGHT

CLOSEUP √ A snub-nosed .38, which Clarence loads and sticks down his
heavy athletic sock.

INT. CALRENCE'S APARTMENT √ LIVING ROOM √ NIGHT

Clarence returns.

CLARENCE
Sweetheart, write down your former address.

ALABAMA
What?

CLARENCE
Write down Drexl's address.

ALABAMA
Why?

CLARENCE
So I can go over there and pick up your things.

ALABAMA
(really scared)
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.

He kneels down before her and holds her hand.

CLARENCE
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker.
He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses
absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it
would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?

ALABAMA
You don't know him √

CLARENCE
You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I
need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down
the address.

TITLE CARD: ""CASS QUARTER, HEART OF DETROIT""

EXT. DOWNTOWN DETROIT STREET √ NIGHT

It's pretty late at night. Clarence steps out of his red Mustang. He's right smack
dab in the middle of a bad place to be in daytime. He checks the pulse on his
neck; it's beating like a race horse. To pump himself up he does a quick Elvis
Presley gyration.

CLARENCE
(in Elvis voice)
Yeah... Yeah...

He makes a beeline for the front door of a large, dark apartment building.

INT. DARK BUILDING √ NIGHT

He's inside. His heart's really racing now. He has the TV guide that Alabama wrote the address on in his hand. He climbs a flight of stairs and makes his way down a dark hallway to apartment 22, the residence of Drexl Spivey. Clarence knock on the door.

A YOUNG BLACK MAN, about twenty years old, answers the door. He has
really big biceps and is wearing a black and white fishnet football jersey.

YOUNG BLACK MAN
You want somethin'?

CLARENCE
Drexl?

YOUNG BLACK MAN
Naw, man, I'm Marty. Watcha want?

CLARENCE
I gotta talk to Drexl.

MARTY
Well, what the fuck you wanna tell him?

CLARENCE
It's about Alabama.

A figure jumps in the doorway wearing a yellow Farah Fawcett T-shirt. It's our
friend, Drexl Spivey.

DREXL
Where the fuck is that bitch?

CLARENCE
She's with me.

DREXL
Who the fuck are you?

CLARENCE
I'm her husband.

DREXL
Well. That makes us practically related. Bring your ass on in.

INT. DREXL'S LIVING ROOM √ NIGHT

Drexl and Marty about-face and walk into the room, continuing a conversation
they were having and leaving Clarence standing in the doorway. This is not the
confrontation Clarence expected. He trails in behind Drexl and Marty.

DREXL
(to Marty)
What was I sayin'?

MARTY
Rock whores.

DREXL
You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They
got that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you.
They give you hips, lips, and fingertips.

Drexl looks over his shoulder at Clarence.

DREXL
(to Clarence)
You know what I'm talkin' about.

Drexl gestures to one of the THREE STONED HOOKERS lounging about the
apartment.

DREXL
(to Marty)
These bitches over here ain't shit. You stomp them bitches to death to get
the kind of pussy I'm talkin' about.

Drexl sits down at a couch with a card table in front of it, scattered with take-
out boxes of Chinese food. A black exploitation movie is playing on TV.

DREXL
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with
Cherry Seven-Up.

MARTY
Pussy love pink rocks.

This is not how Clarence expected to confront Drexl, but this is exactly what he
expected Drexl to be like. He positions himself in front of the food table,
demanding Drexl's attention.

DREXL
(eating with chopsticks, to Clarence)
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We
got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.

CLARENCE
No thanks.

DREXL
No thanks? What does that mean? Means you ate before you came down
here? All full. Is that it? Naw, I don't think so. I think you're too scared to
be eatin'. Now, see we're sittin' down here, ready to negotiate, and you've
already given up your shit. I'm still a mystery to you. But I know exactly
where your ass is comin' from. See, if I asked you if you wanted some
dinner and you grabbed an egg roll and started to chow down, I'd say to
myself, ""This motherfucker's carryin' on like he ain't got a care in the
world. Who know? Maybe he don't. Maybe this fool's such a bad
motherfucker, he don't got to worry about nothin', he just sit down, eat my
Chinese, watch my TV."" See? You ain't even sat down yet. On that TV
there, since you been in the room, is a woman with her titties hangin' out,
and you ain't even bothered to look. You just been starin' at me. Now, I
know I'm pretty, but I ain't as pretty as a couple of titties.

Clarence takes out an envelope and throws it on the table.

CLARENCE
I'm not eatin' cause I'm not hungry. I'm not sittin' cause I'm not stayin'.
I'm not lookin' at the movie cause I saw it seven years ago. It's ""The
Mack"" with Max Julian, Carol Speed, and Richard Pryor, written by
Bobby Poole, directed by Michael Campus, and released by Cinerama
Releasing Company in 1984. I'm not scared of you. I just don't like you. In
that envelope is some payoff money. Alabama's moving on to some greener
pastures. We're not negotiatin'. I don't like to barter. I don't like to dicker.
I never have fun in Tijuana. That price is non-negotiable. What's in that
envelope is for my peace of mind. My peace of mind is worth that much.
Not one penny more, not one penny more.

You could hear a pin drop. Once Clarence starts talking Marty goes on full
alert. Drexl stops eating and the Whores stop breathing. All eyes are on Drexl.
Drexl drops his chopsticks and opens the envelope. It's empty.

DREXL
It's empty.

Clarence flashes a wide Cheshire cat grin that says, ""That's right, asshole.""

Silence.

DREXL
Oooooooooh weeeeeeee! This child is terrible. Marty, you know what we
got here? Motherfuckin' Charles Bronson. Is that who you supposed to be?
Mr. Majestyk? Looky here, Charlie, none of this shit is necessary. I ain't
got no hold on Alabama. I just tryin' to lend the girl a helpin' hand √

Before Drexl finishes his sentence he picks up the card table and throws it at
Clarence, catching him of guard.

Marty comes up behind Clarence and throws his arm around his neck, putting
him in a tight choke hold.

Clarence, with his free arm, hits Marty hard with his elbow in the solar plexus.
We'll never know if that blow had any effect because at just that moment Drexl
takes a flying leap and tackles the two guys.

All of them go crashing into the stereo unit and a couple of shelves that hold
records, all of which collapse to the floor in a shower of LPs.

Marty, who's on the bottom of the pile, hasn't let go of Clarence.

Since Drexl's on top, he starts slamming fists into Clarence's face.

Clarence, who's sandwiched between these two guys, can't do a whole lot about
it.

DREXL
Ya wanna fuck with me?
(hits Clarence)
Ya wanna fuck with me?
(hits Clarence)
I'll show ya who you're fuckin' wit!

He hits Clarence hard in the face with both fists.

Clarence, who has no leverage whatsoever, grabs hold of Drexl's face and digs
his nails in. He sticks his thumb in Drexl's mouth, grabs a piece of cheek, and
starts twisting.

Marty, who's in an even worse position, can do nothing but tighten his grip
aroud Clarence's neck, until Clarence feels like his eyes are going to pop out of
his head.

Drexl's face is getting torn up, but he's also biting down hard on Clarence's
thumb.

Clarence raises his head and brings it down fast, crunching Marty's face, and
busting his nose.

Marty loosens his grip around Clarence's neck. Clarence wiggles free and gets
up on his knees.

Drexl and Clarence are now on an even but awkward footing. The two are
going at each other like a pair of alley cats, not aiming their punches, keeping
them coming fast and furious. They're not doing much damage to each other
because of their positions, it's almost like a hockey fight.

Marty sneaks up behind Clarence and smashes him in the head with a stack of
LPs. This disorients Clarence. Marty grabs him from behind and pulls him to
his feet.

Drexl socks him in the face: one, two three! Then he kicks him hard in the balls.

Marty lets go and Clarence hits the ground like a sack of potatoes. He curls up
into a fetal position and holds his balls, tears coming out of his eyes.

Drexl's face is torn up from Clarence's nails.

Marty has blood streaming down his face frim his nose and on to his shirt.

DREXL
(to Marty)
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?

MARTY
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.

Drexl kicks Clarence, who's still on the ground hurting.

DREXL
(to Clarence)
You see what you get when you fuck wit me, white boy? You're gonna walk
in my goddamn house, my house! Gonna come in here and tell me! Talkin'
smack, in my house, in front of my employees. Shit! Your ass must be
crazy.
(to Marty)
I don't think that white boy's got good sense. Hey, Marty.
(laughing)
He must of thought it was white boy day. It ain't white boy day, is it?

MARTY
(laughing)
Naw, man, it ain't white boy day.

DREXL
(to Clarence)
Shit, man, you done fucked up again. Next time you bogart your way into a
nigger's crib, an' get all his face, make sure you do it on white boy day.

CLARENCE
(hurting)
Wannabee nigger...

DREXl
Fuck you! My mother was Apache.

Drexl kicks him again. Clarence curls up.

Drexl bends down and looks for Clarence's wallet in his jacket.

Clarence still can't do much. The kick to his balls still has him down.

Drexl finds it and pulls it out. He flips it open to driver's license.

DREXL
Well, well, well, looky what we got here. Clarence Worley. Sounds almost
like a nigger name.
(to Clarence)
Hey, dummy.

He puts his foot on Clarence's chest. Clarence's POV as he looks up.

DREXL
Before you bought your dumb ass through the door, I didn't know shit. I
just chalked it up to au revoir Alabama. But, because you think you're
some macho motherfucker, I know who she's with. You. I know who you
are, Clarence Worley. And, I know where you live, 4900 116th street,
apartment 48. And I'll make a million-dollar bet, Alabama's at the same
address. Marty, take the car and go get 'er. Bring her dumb ass back here.

He hands Marty the driver's license. Maty goes to get the car keys and a jacket.

DREXL
(to Marty)
I'll keep lover boy here entertained.
(to Clarence)
You know the first thing I'll do when she gets here. I think I'll make her
suck my dick, and I'll come all in her face. I mean it ain't nuttin' new. She's
done it before. But I want you as a audience.
(hollering to Marty)
Marty, what the fuck are you doin'?

MARTY
(off)
I'm tryin' to find my jacket.

DREXL
Look in the hamper. Linda's been dumpin' everybody's stray clothes there
lately.

While Drexl has his attention turned to Marty, Clarence reaches into his sock
and pulls out the .38. he stick the barrel between Drexl's legs. Drexl, who's
standing over Clarence, looks down just in time to see Clarence pull the trigger
and blow his balls to bits. Tiny spots of blood speckle Clarence's face.

Drexl shrieks in horror and pain, and falls to the ground.

MARTY
(off)
What's happening?

Marty steps into the room.

Clarence doesn't hesitate, he shoots Marty four times in the chest.

Two of three Hookers have run out of the front door, screaming. The other
Hooker is curled up in the corner. She's too stoned to run, but stoned enough to
be terrified.

Drexl, still alive, is laying on the ground howling, holding what's left of his
balls and his dick.

Clarence points the gun at the remaining Hooker.

CLARENCE
Get a bag and put Alabama's thing in it!

She doesn't move.

CLARENCE
You wanna get shot? I ain't got all fuckin' day, so move it!

The Hooker, tears of fear ruining her mascara, grabs a suitcase from under the
bed, and, on her hands and knees, pushes it along the floor to Clarence.

Clarence takes it by the handle and wobbles over to Drexl, who's curled up like
a pillbug.

CLOSEUP √ Clarence's forgotten driver's license in Marty's bloody hand.

Clarence puts his foot on Drexl's chest.

CLARENCE
(to Drexl)
Open you eyes, laughing boy.

He doesn't. Clarence gives him a kick.

CLARENCE
Open you eyes!

He does. It's now Drexl's POV from the floor.

CLARENCE
You thought it was pretty funny, didn't you?

He fires.

CLOSEUP √ The bullet comes out of the gun and heads right toward us. When
it reaches us, the screen goes awash in red.

INT. CLARENCE'S APARTMENT √ NIGHT

The front swings open and Clarence walks in. Alabama jumps off the couch and
runs toward Clarence, before she reaches him he blurts out:

CLARENCE
I killed him.

She stops short.

CLARENCE
I've got some food in the car, I'll be right back.

Clarence leaves. Except for the TV playing, the room is quiet. Alabama sits on
the couch.

Clarence walks back into the room with a whole bounty of take-out food. He
heaps it on to the coffee table and starts to chow down.

CLARENCE
Help yourself. I got enough. I am fuckin' starvin'. I think I ordered one of
everythin'.

He stops and looks at here.

CLARENCE
I am so hungry.

He starts eating french fries and hamburgers.

ALABAMA
(in a daze)
Was it him or you?

CLARENCE
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there
I said to myself, ""If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it."" I could.
So I did.

ALABAMA
Is this a joke?

CLARENCE
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious,
I've never had a hamburger taste this good.

Alabama starts to cry. Clarence continues eating, ignoring her.

CLARENCE
Come on, Bama, eat something. You'll feel better.

She continues crying. He continues eating and ignoring her. Finally he spins on
her, yelling:

CLARENCE
Why are you crying? He's not worth one of your tears. Would you rather it
had been me? Do you love him?
(no answer)
Do you love him?
(no answer)
Do you love him?

She looks at Clarence, having a hard time getting a word out.

ALABAMA
I think what you did was...

CLARENCE
What?

ALABAMA
I think what you did...

CLARENCE
What?

ALABAMA
... was so romantic.

Clarence is completely taken back. They meet in a long, passionate lovers' kiss.
Their kiss breaks and slowly the world comes back to normal.

CLARENCE
I gotta get outta these clothes.

He picks up the suitcase and drops it on the table in front of them.

ALABAMA
(comically)
Clean clothes. There is a god,

Clarence flips open the suitcase. Alabama's and her husband's jaws drop.

ALABAMA
Clarence. Those aren't my clothes.

CUT TO:

EXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN √ DAY

We see the Hollywood Holiday Inn sign. Pan to the parking lot where
Clarence's empty red Mustang is parked.

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN √ CALRENCE'S ROOM √ DAY

CLOSEUP √ Dick's jaw drops. His hand reaches out of shot.

CLOSEUP √ The reason for all the jaw dropping... the suitcase is full of
cocaine!

Clarence smiles, holding a bottle of wine.

Alabama's watching the cable TV.

DICK
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

ALABAMA
This is great, we got cable.

CLARENCE
(to Alabama)
Bama, you got your blade?

Keeping her eyes on the TV, she pulls out from her purse a Swiss army knife
with a tiny dinosaur on it and tosses it to Clarence. Clarence takes off the
corkscrew and opens the wine.

He pours some wine into a couple of hotel plastic cups, a big glass for Dick, a
little one for himself. He hands it to Dick. Dick takes it and drinks.

DICK
This shit can't be real.

CLARENCE
It'll get ya high.

He tosses the knife.

CLARENCE
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?

ALABAMA
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.

Using the knife, Dick snorts some of the cocaine. He jumps back.

DICK
It's fuckin' real!
(to Clarence)
It's fuckin' real!

CLARENCE
I certainly hope so.

DICK
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!

CLARENCE
I know.

DICK
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?

CLARENCE
Tell me.

DICK
I don't know! A fuckin' lot!

He downs his wine. Clarence fills his glass.

DICK
This is Drexl's coke?

CLARENCE
Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he
wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama
are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So,
you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?

DICK
Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.

Dick gulps half of his wine. Clarence fills up.

CLARENCE
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the
set.

DICK
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know
those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot
to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit
at a time √

CLARENCE
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.

DICK
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?

CLARENCE
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred
thousand. How difficult can that be?

DICK
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat
cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two
hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And,
more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could
possibly help you.

CLARENCE
Is he big league?

DICK
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very
powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could
be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.

CLARENCE
What'd'ya tell 'em?

DICK
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and
what wasn't.

CLARENCE
What's this acting class guy's name?

DICK
Elliot.

CLARENCE
Elliot what?

DICK
Elliot Blitzer.

CLARENCE
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the
getting to know you stuff.

DICK
Where?

CLARENCE
(to Alabama)
The zoo.

CLARENCE
(to Dick)
The zoo.
(pause)
What are you waiting for?

DICK
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?

CLARENCE
What's to think about?

DICK
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're
married. You killed a guy.

CLARENCE
Two guys.

DICK
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck,
Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean
shit.

CLARENCE
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a
fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he
deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit
badge or somethin'.

Dick rests his head in his hands.

CLARENCE
Look, buddy, I realize I'm layin' some pretty heavy shit on ya, but I need
you to rise to the occasion. So, drink some more wine. Get used to the idea,
and get your friend to the phone.

EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO √ DAY

CLOSEUP √ A black panther, the four-legged kind, paces back and forth.

Clarence, Alabama, Dick and ELLIOT BLITZER are walking through the zoo.
One look at Elliot and you can see what type of actor he is, a real GQ, blow-dry
boy. As they walk and talk, Clarence is eating a box of animal crackers and
Alabama is blowing soap bubbles.

ELLIOT
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're
unloading √

CLARENCE
Want an animal cracker?

ELLIOT
Yeah, OK.

He takes one.

CLARENCE
Leave the gorillas.

ELLIOT
√ that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars √

CLARENCE
Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime.

DICK
(trying to chill him out)
Clarence...

ELLIOT
Where did you get it?

CLARENCE
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high
enough so you can't see it from the street.

ELLIOT
(forcing a laugh)
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?

CLARENCE
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind
of a paste √

ELLIOT
(turning to Dick)
Look, Dick, I don't √

CLARENCE
(laughing)
No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you
but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're
good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of
good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.

ELLIOT
What department?

CLARENCE
What do you think, eightball?

ELLIOT
The police department?

CLARENCE
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob
questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the
evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with
a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he
could trust.

ELLIOT
He trusts you?

CLARENCE
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So,
I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get
fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you
didn't hear nothin'.

ELLIOT
Sure. I didn't hear anything.

Elliot is more than satisfied. Clarence makes a comical face at Dick when
Elliot's not looking. Dick is wearing I-don't-believe-this-guy expresion.
Alabama is forever blowing bubbles.

CUT TO:

EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO √ SNACK BAR √ DAY

We're in the snack bar area of the zoo. Alabama, Dick, and Elliot are sitting
around a plastic outdoor table. Clarence is pacing around the table as he talks.
Alabama is still blowing bubbles.

CLARENCE
(to Elliot)
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like
French vanilla ice-cream?

Elliot hasn't the slightest idea what that is supposed to mean.

ELLIOT
What?

CLARENCE
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like
French vanilla ice-cream?

ELLIOT
(with conviction)
No. No, you don't.

CLARENCE
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?

DICK
Clarence...

CLARENCE
(to Dick)
Let me handle this.

ELLIOT
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys,
and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're
dependable. And, they're safe.

CLARENCE
Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what
the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your
time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's
interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe
fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he
can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's
best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not
puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But,
don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some
guts.

Elliot has been silenced. He nods his head in agreement.

INT. PORSCHE √ MOVING √ MULHOLLAND DRIVE √ DAY

Movie producer, LEE DONOWITZ, is driving his Porsche through the winding
Hollywood hills, just enjoying being rich and powerful. His cellular car phone
rings, he answers.

LEE
Hello.
(pause)
Elliot, it's Sunday. Why am I talkin' to you on Sunday? I don't see enough
of you during the week I gotta talk to you on Sunday? Why is it you always
call me when I'm on the windiest street in L.A.?

BACK TO:

ELLIOT

Elliot is on the zoo payphone. Clarence is next to him. Dick is next to Clarence.
Alabama is next to Dick, blowing bubbles.

ELLIOT
(on phone)
I'm with that party you wanted me to get together with. Do you know what
I'm talking about, Lee?

BACK TO:

LEE

Store-fronts whiz by in the background.

LEE
Why the hell are you calling my phone to talk about that?

BACK TO:

ELLIOT

ELLIOT
Well, he'd here right now, and he insists on talking to you.

BACK TO:

LEE

In the 7th street tunnel. Lee'svoice echoes.

LEE
Are you outta your fuckin' mind?

BACK TO:

ELLIOT

ELLIOT

Clarence takes the receiverout of Elliot's hand.

CLARENCE
(into phone)
Hello, Lee, it's Clarence. At last we meet.

EXT. DICK'S APARTMENT √ DAY

Virgil's knocking on Dick's door. Floyd (Dick's room-mate) answers.

VIRGIL
Hello, is Dick Ritchie here?

FLOYD
Naw, he ain't home right now.

VIRGIL
Do you live here?

FLOYD
Yeah, I live here.

VIRGIL
Sorta room-mates?

FLOYD
Exactly room-mates.

VIRGIL
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours
from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be
travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they
stayin' here?

FLOYD
Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're
stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.

VIRGIL
How do you know? You been there?

FLOYD
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda
easy to remember.

VIRGIL
You're right. It is.

EXT. LOS ANGELES ZOO √ PAYPHONE √ DAY

Clarence is still on the phone with Lee.

CLARENCE
Lee, the reason I'm talkin' with you is I want to open ""Doctor Zhivago"" in
L.A. And I want you to distribute it.

BACK TO:

LEE

Stopped in the traffic on Sunset Boulevard.

LEE
I don't know, Clarence, ""Doctor Zhivago"" is a pretty big movie.

BACK TO:

CLARENCE

CLARENCE
The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a
lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a
movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.

BACK TO:

LEE

He's still on Sunset Boulevard, the traffic's moving better now.

LEE
I'm not sayin' I'm not interested. But being a distributer's not what I'm all
about. I'm a film producer, I'm on this world to make good movies.
Nothing more. Now, having my big toe dipped into the distribution end
helps me on many levels.

Traffic breaks and Lee speeds along. The background whizzes past him.

LEE
(continuing)
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of
distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna
accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.

BACK TO:

CLARENCE

CLARENCE
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a
risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks,
then go straight to cable. This is ""Doctor Zhivago"". This'll be packin' 'em
in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to
work with anybody's movie but mine.

BACK TO:

LEE

Speeding down a benchside road.

LEE
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to ""Doctor Zhivago"" are
in arbitration?

BACK TO:

CLARENCE

CLARENCE
I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a
courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on
the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're
in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have
to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.

Pause. Clarence hands the phone to Elliot.

CLARENCE
(to Elliot)
He wants to talk ya.

ELLIOT
(into phone)
Mr. Donowitz?
(pause)
I told you, through Dick.
(pause)
He's in my acting class.
(pause)
About a year.
(pause)
Yeah, he's good.
(pause)
They grew up together.
(pause)
Sure thing.

Elliot hangs up the phone.

ELLIOT
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants
everybody there.
(pointing to Clarence)
He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do
business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a
sample bag.

CLARENCE
No problems on both counts.

He offers Elliot the animal crackers.

CLARENCE
Have a cookie.

Elliot takes one.

ELLIOT
Thanks.

He puts it in the mouth.

CLARENCE
That wasn't a gorilla, was it?

EXT. HOLIDAY INN √ DAY

The red Mustang with Clarence and Alabama pulls up to the hotel. Alabama
hops out. Clarence stays in.

ALABAMA
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do
my part OK?

CLARENCE
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.

ALABAMA
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.

CLARENCE
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head.
I'm gonna go grab dinner.

ALABAMA
I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm
gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated
movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.

They kiss.

CLARENCE
We now return to ""Bullit"" already in progress.

He slams the Mustang in reverse and peels out of the hotel. Alabama walks her
little walk from the parking lot to the pool area. Somebody whistles at her, she
turns to them.

ALABAMA
Thank you.

She gets to her door, takes out the key, and opens the door.

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN √ CALRENCE'S ROOM √ DAY

She steps in only to find Virgil sitting on a chair placed in front of the door with
a sawed-off shotgun aimed right at her.

VIRGIL
(calmly)
Step inside and shut the door.

She doesn't move, she's frozen. Virgil leans forward.

VIRGIL
(calmly)
Lady. I'm gonna shoot you in the face.

She does exactly as he says. Virgil rises, still aiming the sawed-off.

VIRGIL
Step away from the door, move into the bathroom.

She does. He puts the shotgun down on the chair, then steps closer to her.

VIRGIL
OK, Alabama, where's our coke, where's Clarence, and when's he coming
back.

ALABAMA
I think you got the wrong room, my name is Sadie. I don't have any Coke,
but there's a Pepsi machine downstairs. I don't know any Clarence, but
maybe my husband does. You might have heard of him, he play football. Al
Lylezado. He'll be home any minute, you can ask him.

Virgil can't help but smile.

VIRGIL
You're cute.

Virgil jumps up and does a mid-air kung fu kick which catches Alabama square
in the face, lifting her off the ground and dropping her flat on her back.

INT. MOVING RED MUSTANG √ DAY

Clarence, in his car, driving to get something to eat, singing to himself.

CLARENCE
(singing)
""Land of stardust, land of glamour,
Vistavision and Cinema,
Everything about it is a must,
To get to Hollywood, or bust...""

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN √ CLARENCE'S ROOM √ DAY

Alabama's laying flat. She actually blacks out for a moment, but the salty taste
of the blood in her mouth wakes her up. She opens her eyes and sees Virgil
standing there, smiling. She closes them, hoping it's a dream. They open again
to the same sight. She has never felt more helpless in her life.

VIRGIL
Hurts, don't it? It better. Took me a long time to kick like that. I'm third-
degree blackbelt, you know? At home I got trophies. Tournaments I was in.
Kicked all kinds of ass. I got great technique. You ain't hurt that bad. Get
on your feet, Fruitloop.

Alabama wobbily complies.

VIRGIL
Where's our coke? Where's Clarence? And when he's comin' back?

Alabama looks in Virgil's eyes and realizes that without a doubt she's going to
die, because this man is going to kill her.

ALABAMA
Go take a flying fuck and a rolling donut.

Virgil doesn't waste a second. He gives her a sidekick straight to the stomach.
The air is sucked out of her lungs. She falls to her knees. She's on all fours
gasping for air that's just not there.

Virgil whips out a pack of Lucky Strikes. He lights one up with a Zippo lighter.
He takes a long, deep drag.

VIRGIL
Whatsamatta? Can't breathe? Get used to it.

INT. HAMBURGER STAND √ DAY

Clarence walks through the door of some mom and pop fast-food restaurant.

CLARENCE
Woah! Smells like hamburgers in here! What's the biggest, fattest
hamburger you guys got?

The IRANIAN GUY at the counter says:

IRANIAN GUY
That would be Steve's double chili cheeseburger.

CLARENCE
Well, I want two of them bad boys. Two large orders of chili fries. Two
large Diet Cokes.
(looking at a menu at the wall)
And I'll tell you what, why don't you give me a combination burrito as well.

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN √ CLARENCE'S ROOM √ DAY

Alabama is violently thrown into a corner of the room. She braces herself
against the wall. She is very punchy. Virgil steps in front of her.

VIRGIL
You think your boyfriend would go through this kind of shit for you?
Dream on, cunt. You're nothin' but a fuckin' fool. And your pretty face is
gonna turn awful goddamn ugly in about two seconds. Now, where's my
fuckin' coke?

She doesn't answer. He delivers a spinning roundhouse kick on the head. Her
head slams into the left side of the wall.

VIRGIL
Where's Clarence?!

Nothing. He gives her another kick to the head, this time from the other side.
Her legs start to give way. He catches her and throws her back. He slaps her
lightly in the face to revive her, she looks at him.

VIRGIL
When's Clarence getting back?

She can barely raise her arm, but she somehow manages, and she gives him the
middle finger. Virgil can't help but smile.

VIRGIL
You gotta lot of heart, kid.

He gives her a spinning roadhouse kick to the head that sends her to the floor.

INT. HAMBURGER STAND √ DAY

CLOSEUP √ Burgers sizzling on a griddle, Chili and cheese is put on them.

Clarence is waiting for his order. He notices a CUSTOMER reading a copy of
""Newsweek"" with Elvis on the cover.

CLARENCE
That's a great issue.

The Customer lowers his magazine a little bit.

CUSTOMER
Yeah, I subscribe. It's a pretty decent one.

CLARENCE
Have you read the story on Elvis?

CUSTOMER
No. Not yet.

CLARENCE
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I
look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I
ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever
wrong.

CUSTOMER
That good, huh?

He takes the magazine from the Customer's hands and starts flipping to the
Elvis article.

CLARENCE
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the
whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew
up with him, the artists he inspired √ Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and
the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the
creeps.

CUSTOMER
I can see what you mean.

CLARENCE
Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every
branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.

Clarence and the Customer laugh.

INT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN √ CLARENCE'S ROOM √ DAY

Alabama's pretty beat up. She has a fat lip and her face is black and blue. She's
crawling around on the floor. Virgil is tearing the place apart looking for the
cocaine. He's also carrying on a running commentary.

VIRGIL
Now the first guy you kill is always the hardest. I don't care if you're the
Boston Strangler or Wyatt Earp. You can bet that Texas boy, Charles
Whitman, the fella who shot all them guys from that tower, I'll bet you
green money that that first little black dot that he took a bead on, was the
bitch of the bunch. No foolin' the first one's a tough row to ho. Now, the
second one, while it ain't no Mardi Gras, it ain't half as tough row to ho.
You still feel somethin' but it's just so deluted this time around. Then you
completely level off on the third one. The third one's easy. It's gotten to the
point now I'll do it just to watch their expressions change.

He's tearing the motel room up in general. Then he flips the matress up off the
bed, and the black suitcase is right there.

Alabama's crawling, unnoticed to where her purse is lying. Virgil flips open the
black case and almost goes snow blind.

VIRGIL
Well, well, well, looky here. I guess I just reached journey's end. Great.
One less thing I gotta worry about.

Virgil closes the case. Alabama sifts through her purse.

She pulls out her Swiss army knife, opens it up. Virgil turns toward her.

VIRGIL
OK, Sugarpop, we've come to what I like to call the moment of truth √

Alabama slowly rises clutching the thrust-out knife in both hands. Mr. Karate-
man smiles.

VIRGIL
Kid, you got a lotta heart.

He moves toward her.

Alabama's hands are shaking.

VIRGIL
Tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give you a free swing. Now, I only
do that for people I like.

He moves close.

Alabama's eyes study him. He grabs the front of his shirt and rips it open.
Buttons fly everywhere.

VIRGIL
Go ahead, girl, take a stab at it.
(giggling)
You don't have anything to lose.

CLOSEUP √ Alabama's face. Virgil's right, she doesn't have anything to lose.
Virgil's also right about his being the moment of truth. The ferocity in women
that comes out at certain times, and is just here under the surface in many
women all of the time, is unleashed. The absolute feeling of helplessness she felt
only a moment ago has taken a one hundred and eighty degree turn into ""I'll
take this motherfucker with me if it's the last thing I do"" seething hatred.

Letting out a bloodcurling yell, she raises the knfe high above her head, then
drops to her knees and plunges it deep into Virgil's right foot.

CLOSEUP √ VIRGIL'S FACE

Talk about bloodcurling yells.

Virgil bends down and carefully pulls the knife from his foot, tears running
down his face.

While Virgil's bent down, Alabama smashes an Elvis Presley whiskey decanter
that Clarence bought her in Oklahoma over his head. It's only made of plaster,
so it doesn't kill him.

Virgil's moving toward Alabama, limping on his bad foot.

VIRGIL
OK, no more Mr. Nice-guy.

Alabama picks up the hotel TV and tosses it to him. He instinctively catches it
and, with his arms full of television, Alabama cold-cocks him with her fist in the
nose, breaking it.

Her eyes go straight to the door, then to the sawed-off shotgun by it. She runs to
it, bends over the chair for the gun. Virgil's left foot kicks her in the back,
sending her flying over the chair and smashing into the door.

Virgil furiously throws the chair out of the way and stands over Alabama.
Alabama's lying on the ground laughing. Virgil has killed a lot of people, but
not one of them has ever laughed before he did it.

VIRGIL
What's so fuckin' funny?!!

ALABAMA
(laughing)
You look so ridiculous.

She laughs louder. Virgil's insane. He picks her off the floor, then lifts her off
the ground and throws her through the glass shower door in the bathroom.

VIRGIL
Laugh it up, cunt. You were in hysterics a minute ago. Why ain't you
laughing now?

Alabama, lying in the bathtub, grabs a small bottle of hotel shampoo and
squeezes it out in her hand.

Virgil reaches in the shower and grabs hold of her hair.

Alabama rubs the shampoo in his face. He lets go of her and his hands go to his
eyes.

VIRGIL
Oh Jesus!

She grabs hold of a hefty piece of broken glass and plunges it into his face.

VIRGIL
Oh Mary, help me!

The battered and bruised and bloody Alabama emerges from the shower. She's
clutching a big, bloody piece of broken glass. She's vaguely reminiscent of a
Tasmanian devil. Poor Virgil can't see very well, but he sees her figure coming
toward him. He lets out a wild haymaker that catches her in the jaw and knocks
her into the toilet.

Ahe recovers almost immediately and takes the porcelain lid off the back of the
toilet tank.

Virgil whips out a .45 automatic from his shoulder holster, just as Alabama
brings the lid down on his head. He's pressed up against the wall with this toilet
lid hitting him. He can't get a good shot in this tight environment, but he fires
anyway, hitting the floor, the all, the toilet, and the sink.

The toilet lid finally shatters against Virgil's head. He falls to the ground.

Alabama goes to the medicine cabinet and whips out a big can of Final Net
hairspray. She pulls a Bic lighter out of her pocket, and, just as Virgil raises his
gun at her, she flicks the Bic and sends a stream of hairspray through the flame,
which results in a big ball of fire that hits Virgil right in the face.

He fires off two shots. One hits the wall, another hits the sink pipe, sending
water spraying.

Upon getting his face fried Virgil screams and jumps up, knocking Alabama
down, and runs out of the bathroom.

Virgil collapses on the floor of the living room. Then, he sees the sawed-off
laying on the ground. He crawls toward it.

Alabama, in the bathroom, sees where he's heading. She picks up the .45
automatic and fires at him. It's empty. She's on her feet and into the room.

He reaches the shotgun, his hands grasp it.

Alabama spots and picks up the bloody Swiss army knife. She takes a knife-first-
running-dive at Virgil's back. She hits him.

He arches up, firing the sawed-off into the ceiling, dropping the gun, and
sending a cloud of plaster and stucco all over the room.

Alabama snatches the shotgun.

Arched over on his back Virgil and Alabama make eye contact.

The first blast hits him in the shoulder, almost tearing his arm off. The second
hits him in the knee. The third plays hell with his chest.

Alabama then runs at him, hitting him in the head with the butt of the shotgun.

Ever since he's been firing it's as if some other part of her brain has been
functioning independently. She's been absent-mindedly saying the prayer of
Saint Francis of Assisi.

ALABAMA
Lord, make me an instrument of Thy peace;
where there is hatred, let me sow love;
where there is injury, pardon;
where there is doubt, faith;
where there is despair, hope;
where there is darkness, light;
and where there is sadness, joy.
O Divine Master, grant that I may not
so much seek to be consoled as to console;
to be understood as to understand;
to be loved as to love;
for it is in giving that we receive,
it is pardoning that we are pardoned,
and it is in dying that we are born
to eternal life.

Clarence, who's been hearing gunshots, bursts through the door, gun drawn,
only to see Alabama, hitting a dead guy on the head, with a shotgun.

CLARENCE
Honey?

She continues. He puts his gun away.

CLARENCE
Sweetheart? Cops are gonna be here any minute,

She continues. He takes the gun away from her, and she falls to the ground. She
lies on the floor trembling, continuing with the downward swings of her arms.

Clarence grabs the shotgun and the cocaine, and tosses Alabama over his
shoulder.

CUT TO:

EXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN √ DAY

Everybody is outside their rooms wathcing as Clarence walks through the pool
area with his bundle. Sirens can be heard.

EXT. MOVING RED MUSTANG √ DAY

Clarence is driving like mad. Alabama's passed out in the passenger seat. She's
muttering to herself. Clarence has one hand on the steering wheel and the other
strokes Alabama's hair.

CLARENCE
Sleep baby. Don't dream. Don't worry. Just sleep. You deserve better than
this. I'm so sorry. Sleep my angel. Sleep peacefully.

EXT. MOTEL 6 √ NIGHT

A new motel. Clarence's red Mustang is parked outside.

INT. MOTEL 6 √ CLARENCE'S ROOM √ NIGHT

Alabama, with a fat lip and a black and blue face, is asleep in bed.

INT. NOWHERE

Clarence is in a nondescript room speaking directly to the camera. He's in a
headshot.

CLARENCE
I feel so horrible about what she went through. That fucker really beat the
shit out of her. She never told him where I was. It's like I always felt that
the way she felt about me was a mistake. She couldn't really care that
much. I always felt in the back of my mind, I don't know, she was jokin'.
But, to go through that and remain loyal, it's very easy to be unraptured
with words, but to remain loyal when it's easier, even excusable, not to √
that's a test of oneself. That's a true romance. I swear to God, I'll cut off my
hands and gouge out my eyes before I'll every let anything happen to that
lady again.

CUT TO:

EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS √ NIGHT

A wonderful, gracefully flowing shot of the Hollywood Hills. Off in the distance
we hear the roar of a car engine.

EXT. MULLHOLLAND DRIVE √ NIGHT

Vaaarrroooooommmm!!! A silver Porsche is driving hells bells, taking quick
corners, pushing it to the edge.

INT. MOVING PORSCHE √ NIGHT

Elliot Blitzer is the driver, standing on it. A blond, glitzy COKE WHORE is
sitting next to him. They're having a ball. Then they're seeing a red and blue
light flashing in the rear-view window. It's the cops.

ELLIOT
Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined,
driving like this!
(he pulls over)
Kandi, you gotta help me.

KANDI
What can I do?

He pulls out the sample bag of cocaine that Clarence gave him earlier.

ELLIOT
You gotta hold this for me.

KANDI
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.

ELLIOT
(frantically)
Just put it in your purse.

KANDI
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.

ELLIOT
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.

KANDI
No way, Jose.

ELLIOT
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.

KANDI
I'm not wearing a bra.

ELLIOT
(pleading)
Put it in your pants.

KANDI
No.

ELLIOT
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.

KANDI
Read my lips.

She mouths the word ""no"".

ELLIOT
After all I've done for you, you fuckin' whore!!

She goes to slap him, she hits the bag of cocaine instead. It rips open. Cocaine
completely covers his blue suit. At that moment Elliot turns to face a flashing
beam. Tears fill his eyes.

INT. POLICE STATION √ INTERROGATION ROOM √ DAY

Elliot is sitting in a chair at the table. Two young, good-looking, casually
dressed, Starsky and Hutch-type POLICE DETECTIVES are questioning him.
They're known in the department as Nicholson and Dimes. The dark-haired one
is Cody Nicholson, and the blond is Nicky Dimes.

NICHOLSON
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine √

DIMES
Not a tiny little vial √

NICHOLSON
But a fuckin' baggie.

DIMES
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.

NICHOLSON
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now
we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time √

DIMES
You're no longer an extra √

NICHOLSON
Or a bit player √

DIMES
Or a supporting actor √

NICHOLSON
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man
show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience √

DIMES
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy
who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll
have so much experience to draw on √

NICHOLSON
And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get
married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because
you'll know what it's like to be a woman.

DIMES
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right
anymore √

NICHOLSON
That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.

Elliot starts crying. Nicholson and Dimes exchange looks and smile. Mission
accomplished.

INT. POLICE STATION √ CAPTAIN KRINKLE'S OFFICE √ DAY

CAPTAIN BUFFORD KRINKLE is sitting behind his desk, where he spends
about seventy-five percent of his day. He's you standard rough, gruff, no-
nonsense, by-the-book-type police captain.

KRINKLE
Nicholson! Dimes! Het in here!

The two casually dressed, sneaker-wearing cops rush in, both shouting at once.

NICHOLSON
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin'
into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him
from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form
the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts cryin', and then it
was all over √

DIMES
Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and
if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole
department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta
come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion √

KRINKLE
Both you, idiots shut up, I can't understand shit! Now, what's happened,
what's going on, and what are you talking about?

DIMES
Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for
speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they
bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.

NICHOLSON
Nicholson and I.

DIMES
Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in
Denmark, cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're
sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.

NICHOLSON
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.

DIMES
So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you
ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.

CUT TO:

INT. RESTAURANT √ DAY

Detroit. Very fancy restaurant. FOUR WISE-GUY HOODS, one older, the
other three, youngsters, are seated at the table with Mr. Coccotti.

COCCOTTI
√ And so, tomorrow morning comes, and no Virgil. I check with Nick
Cardella, who Virgil was supposed to leave my narcotics with, he never
shows. Now, children, somebody is stickin' a red-hot poker up my asshole
and what I don't know is whose hand's on the handle.

YOUNG WISE-GUY #1 (FRANKIE)
You think Virgil started gettin' big ideas?

COCCOTTI
It's possible. Anybody can be carried away with delusions of grandeur. But
after that incident in Ann Arbor, I trust Virgil.

YOUNG WISE-GUY #2 (DARIO)
What happened?

OLD WISE-GUY(LENNY)
Virgil got picked up in a warehouse shakedown. He got five years, he
served three.

COCCOTTI
Anybody who clams up and does hid time, I don't care how I feel about him
personally, he's OK.

BACK TO:

KRINKLE'S OFFICE

NICHOLSON
It seems a cop from some department, we don't know where, stole a half a
million dollars of coke from the property cage and he's been sittin' on it for
a year and a half. Now the cops got this weirdo √

DIMES
Suspect's words √

NICHOLSON
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his
boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.

DIMES
He produced ""Coming Home in a Body Bag"".

KRINKLE
That Vietnam movie?

NICHOLSON
Uh-huh.

KRINKLE
That was a good fuckin' movie.

DIMES
Sure was.

KRINKLE
Do you believe him?

NICHOLSON
I believe he believes him.

DIMES
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny
granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.

NICHOLSON
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.

KRINKLE
He'll wear a wire?

DIMES
We talked him into it.

KRINKLE
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.

NICHOLSON
Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire
department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the
twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.

DIMES
Cocaine. Dirty cops. Hollywood. This is Crocket and Tubbs all the way.
And we found it, so we want the fuckin' collar.

BACK TO:

INT. RESTAURANT √ DAY

YOUNG WISE-GUY #3 (MARVIN)
Maybe Virgil dropped it off at Cardella's. Cardella turns Virgil's switch
off, and Cardella decides to open up his own fruit stand.

LENNY
Excuse me, Mr. Coccotti.
(to Marvin)
Do you know Nick Cardella?

MARVIN
No.

LENNY
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?

MARVIN
I didn't mean √

LENNY
Shut your mouth. Nick Cardella was provin' what his words was worth
before you were in your daddy's nutsack. What sun do you walk under you
can throw a shadow on Nick Cardella? Nick Cardella's a stand-up guy.

COCCOTTI
Children, we're digressing. Another possibility is that rat-fuck whore and
her wack-a-doo cowboy boyfriend out-aped Virgil. Knowing Virgil, I find
that hard to believe. But they sent Drexl to hell, and Drexl was no faggot.
So you see, children, I got a lot of questions and no answers. Find out who
this wing-and-a-prayer artist is and take him off at the neck.

TITLE CARD: ""THE BIG DAY""

EXT. IMPERIAL HIGHWAY √ SUNRISE

Clarence's red Mustang is parked on top of a hill just off of Imperial Highway.
As luck would have it, somebody has abandoned a ratty old sofa on the side of
the road. Clarence and Alabama sit on the sofa, sharing a Jumbo Java, and
enjoying the sunrise and wonderful view of the LAX Airport runways, where
planes are taking off and landing. A plane takes off, and they stop and watch.

CLARENCE
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.

ALABAMA
Really?

CLARENCE
With a vengeance, I hated them.

ALABAMA
How come?

CLARENCE
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be
surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I
couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough
enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to
an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin'
out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to
do most, but couldn't.

ALABAMA
What?

CLARENCE
Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips.
Fun, fun, fun, fun.

Another plane takes off.

CLARENCE
But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new
outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes
out there, and go anywhere we ant.

ALABAMA
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where
we can really start from scatch.

CLARENCE
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in
other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off
to, my little turtledove?

ALABAMA
Cancoon.

CLARENCE
Why Cancoon?

ALABAMA
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. ""Clarence and Alabama Go
to Cancoon"". Don't 'cha think?

CLARENCE
But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing.

They kiss.

CLARENCE
Don't you worry 'bout anything. It's all gonna work out for us. We deserve
it.

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT √ DAY

Dick, Clarence and Alabama are just getting ready to leave for the drug deal.
Floyd lays on the couch watching TV. Alabama's wearing dark glasses because
of the black eye she has.

CLARENCE
(to Floyd)
You sure that's how you get to the Beverly Wilshire?

FLOYD
I've partied there twice. Yeah, I'm sure.

DICK
Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass.
(to Clarence)
Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.

CLARENCE
I'm just makin' sure we got everything.
(pointing to Alabama)
You got yours?

She holds up the suitcase. The phone rings. The three pile out the door. Floyd
picks up the phone.

FLOYD
Hello?

He puts his hand over the receiver.

FLOYD
Dick, it's for you. You here?

DICK
No. I left.

He starts to close the door then opens it again.

DICK
I'll take it.
(he takes the receiver)
Hello.
(pause)
Hi, Catherine, I was just walkin' out the √
(pause)
Really?
(pause)
I don't believe it.
(pause)
She really said that?
(pause)
I'll be by first thing.
(pause)
No, thank you for sending me out.
(pause)
Bye-bye.

He hangs up and looks to Clarence.

DICK
(stunned)
I got the part on ""T.J. Hooker"".

CLARENCE
No shit? Dick, that's great!

Clarence and Alabama are jumping around. Floyd even smiles.

DICK
(still stunned)
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and
Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for
seven o'clock in the morning.

CLARENCE
Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.

Dick looks at Clarence. He doesn't want to go.

DICK
Clarence.

CLARENCE
Yeah?

DICK
Um, nothing, let's go?

They exit.

EXT. LAX AIRPORT √ HOTEL √ DAY

We see the airport and move in closer on a hotel on a landscape.

INT. LAX AIRPORT √ HOTEL ROOM √ DAY

Lenny can be seen putting a shotgun together. He is sitting on a bed.

Dario enters the frame with his own shotgun. He goes over to Lenny and gives
him some shells.

Marvin walks through the frame cocking his own shotgun.

The bathroom door opens behind Lenny and Frankie walks out twirling a
couple of .45 automatics in his hands.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE √ COP S' HOTEL ROOM √ DAY

Nicholson and Dimes and FOUR DETECTIVES from internal affairs are in a
room on the same floor as Donowitz. They have just put a wire on Elliot.

NICHOLSON
OK, say something.

ELLIOT
(talking loud into the wire)
Hello! Hello! Hello! How now brown cow!

DIMES
Just talk regular.

ELLIOT
(normal tone)
""But soft! What light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief √""

NICHOLSON
Are you gettin' this shit?

DETECTIVE BY TAPE MACHINE
Clear as a bell.

Nicholson, Dime, and the head IA Officer, Wurlitzer, huddle by Elliot.

DIMES
Now, remember, we'll be monitoring just down the hall.

ELLIOT
And if there's any sign of trouble you'll come in.

NICHOLSON
Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta
put your boss in jail.

DIMES
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an
important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.

NICHOLSON
So you gotta get him to admit on tape that he's buying this coke.

WURLITZER
And this fellow Clarence?

ELLIOT
Yeah, Clarence.

WURLITZER
You gotta get him name the police officer behind all this.

ELLIOT
I'll try.

DIMES
You do more than try.

NICHOLSON
You do.

DIMES
Hope you're a good actor, Elliot.

INT. MOVING RED MUSTANG √ DAY

Clarence, Dick and Alabama en route.

DICK
You got that playing basketball?

ALABAMA
Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled
the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.

They stop at a red light. Clarence looks at Alabama.

CLARENCE
Red light means love, baby.

Ha and Alabama start kissing.

INT. MOVING CADILLAC √ DAY

Marvin, Frankie, Lenny and Dario in a rented Caddy.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE PARKING LOT √ DAY

Clarence, Alabama, and Dick get out of the red Mustang. Dick takes the
suitcase.

CLARENCE
I'll take that. Now, remember, both of you, let me do the talking.

Clarence takes out his .38. Dick reacts. They walk and talk.

DICK
What the fuck did you bring that for.

CLARENCE
In case.

DICK
In case of what?

CLARENCE
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?

DICK
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp √

CLARENCE
I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week
has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a
gun and not to have it.

Pause. Clarence stops walking.

CLARENCE
Hold it, guys. I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm pretty scared.
What say we forget the whole thing.

Dick and Alabama are both surprised and relieved.

DICK
Do you really mean it?

CLARENCE
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think
about it. How 'bout you, Bama?

ALABAMA
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.

CLARENCE
It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't
want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up
there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's
waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the
downside.

DICK
Now's a helluva time to play ""what if"".

CLARENCE
This is our last chance to play ""what if"". I want to do it. I'm just scared of
getting caught.

ALABAMA
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.

CLARENCE
That rhymes.

He kisses her.

DICK
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta
here.

CLARENCE
Yeah, let's just get outta here.

The three walk back to the car. Clarence gets behind the wheel. The other two
climb in. Clarence hops back out.

CLARENCE
I'm sorry guys, I gotta do it. As petrified as I am, I just can't walk away.
I'm gonna be kicking myself in the ass for the rest of my life if I don't go in
there. Lee Donowitz isn't a gangster lookin' to skin us, and he's not a cop,
he's a famous movie producer lookin' to get high. And I'm just the man
who can get him there. So what say we throw caution to the wind and let
the chips fall where they may.

Clarence grabs the suitcase and makes a beeline for the hotel. Dick and
Alabama exchange looks and follow.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE √ LOBBY √ DAY

Elliot's walking around the lobby. He's very nervous, so he's singing to himself.

ELLIOT
(singing)
There's a man who leads a life of danger,
To everyone he meets
he stays a stranger.
Be careful what you say,
you'll give yourself away...

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE √ COPS' HOTEL ROOM √ DAY

Nicholson, Dimes, Wurlitzer, and the three other Detectives surround the tape
machine. Coming from the machine:

ELLIOT'S VOICE
(off)
... odds are you won't live
to see tomorrow,
secret agent man,
secret agent man....

Nicholson looks at Dimes.

NICHOLSON
Why, all of the sudden, have I got a bad feeling?

BACK TO:

LOBBY

Clarence enters the lobby alone, he's carrying the suitcase. He spots Elliot and
goes in his direction. Elliot sees Clarence approaching him. He says to himself,
quietly:

ELLIOT
Elliot, your motivation is to stay out of jail.

Clarence walks up to Elliot, they shake hands.

ELLIOT
Where's everybody else?

CLARENCE
They'll be along.

Alabama and Dick enter the lobby, they join up with Clarence and Elliot.

ELLIOT
Hi, Dick.

DICK
How you doin', Elliot?

CLARENCE
Well, I guess it's about that time.

ELLIOT
I guess so. Follow me.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE √ ELEVATOR √ DAY

The four of them are riding in the elevator. As luck would have it, they have the
car to themselves. Rinky-drink elevator Muzak is playing. They are all silent.

CLARENCE
Elliot.

ELLIOT
Yeah?

CLARENCE
Get on your knees.

Not sure he heard him right.

ELLIOT
What?

Clarence hits the stop button on the elevator panel and whips out his .38.

CLARENCE
I said get on your fuckin' knees.

Elliot does it immediately. Dick and Alabama react.

CLARENCE
Shut up, both of you, I know what I'm doin'.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

Pandemonium.

DIMES
He knows.

NICHOLSON
How the fuck could he know?

DIMES
He saw the wire.

NICHOLSON
How's he supposed to see the wire?

DIMES
He knows something's up.

BACK TO:

ELEVATOR

Clarence puts the .38 against Elliot's forehead.

CLARENCE
You must think I'm pretty stupid, don't you?

No answer.

CLARENCE
Don't you?

ELLIOT
(petrified)
No.

CLARENCE
(yelling)
Don't lie to me, motherfucker. You apparently think I'm the dumbest
motherfucker in the world! Don't you? Say: Clarence, you are without a
doubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. Say it!

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

DIMES
We gotta get him outta there.

NICHOLSON
Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.

BACK TO:

ELEVATOR

CLARENCE
Say it, goddamn it!

ELLIOT
You are the dumbest person in the world.

CLARENCE
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.

ELLIOT
No. No you're not.

CLARENCE
What's waiting for us up there. Tell me or I'll pump two right in your face.

BACK TO:

COPS

NICHOLSON
He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the
show must go on.

DIMES
This guy's gonna kill him.

BACK TO:

ELEVATOR

CLARENCE
Stand up.

Elliot does. The .38 is still pressed against his forehead.

CLARENCE
Like Nick Carter used to say: I I'm wrong, I'll apologize. I want you to tell
me what's waiting for us up there. Something's amiss. I can feel it. If
anything out of the ordinary goes down, believe this, you're gonna be the
first one shot. Trust me, I am AIDS, you fuck with me, you die. Now quit
making me mad and tell me why I'm so fucking nervous.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

NICHOLSON
He's bluffin', I knew it. He doesn't know shit.

DIMES
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.

NICHOLSON
You're am actor, so act, motherfucker.

BACK TO:

ELEVATOR

Elliot still hasn't answered.

CLARENCE
OK.

With the .38 up against Elliot's head Clarence puts his palm over the top of the
gun to shield himself from the splatter. Alabama and Dick can't believe what
he's gonna do.

Elliot, tears running down, starts talking for the benefit of the people at the
other end of the wire. He sounds like a little boy.

ELLIOT
I don't wanna be here. I wanna go home. I wish somebody would just come
and get me cause I don't like this. This is not what I thought it would be.
And I wish somebody would just take me away. Just take me away Come
and get me. Cause I don't like this anymore. I can't take this. I'm sorry but
I just can't. So, if somebody would just come to my rescue, everything
would be alright.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

Nicholson and Dimes shake their hands, They have a ""well, that's that""
expression an their faces.

BACK TO:

ELEVATOR

Clarence puts down the gun and hugs Elliot.

CLARENCE
Sorry, Elliot. Nothing personal. I just hadda make sure you're all right. I'm
sure. I really apologize for scaring you so bad, but believe me, I'm just as
scared as you. Friends?

Elliot, in a state of shock, takes Clarence's hand. Dick and Alabama are
relieved.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

Nicholson and Dimes listen open-mouthed, not believing what they're hearing.

INT. DICK'S APARTMENT √ DAY

Floyd still lying on the couch watching TV. He hasn't moved since we last saw
him.

There is a knock from the door.

FLOYD
(not turning away from TV)
It's open.

The front door flies open and the four Wise-guys rapidly enter the room. The
door slams shut. All have their sawed-offs drawn and pointing at Floyd.

FLOYD
Yes.

LENNY
Are you Dick Ritchie?

FLOYD
No.

LENNY
Do you know a Clarence Worley?

FLOYD
Yes.

LENNY
Do you know where we can find him?

FLOYD
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.

LENNY
Where's that?

FLOYD
Well, you go down Beechwood...

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE - LEE'S HOTEL ROOM √ DAY

The door opens and reveals an EXTREMELY MUSCULAR GUY with an Uzi
strapped to his shoulder standing in the doorway, his name is Monty.

MONTY
Hi, Elliot. Are these your friends?

ELLIOT
You could say that. Everybody, this is Monty.

MONTY
C'mon in. Lee's in the can. He'll be out in a quick.

They all move into the room, it is very luxurious.

ANOTHER INCREDIBLY MUSCULAR GUY, Boris, is sitting on the sofa, he
too has an Uzi. Monty begins patting everybody down.

MONTY
Sorry, nothin personal.

He starts to search Clarence. Clarence back away.

CLARENCE
No need to search me, daredevil. All you'll find is a .38 calibre.

Boris gets up from the couch.

BORIS
What compelled you to bring that along?

CLARENCE
The same thing that compelled you, Beastmaster, to bring rapid-fire
weaponry to a business meeting.

BORIS
I'll take that.

CLARENCE
You'll have to.

The toilet flushes in the bathroom. The door swings open and Lee Donowitz
emerges.

LEE
They're here. Who's who?

ELLIOT
Lee, this is my friend Dick, and these are his friends, Clarence and
Alabama.

BORIS
(pointing at Clarence)
This guy's packin'.

LEE
Really?

CLARENCE
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these ""Soldier of
Fortune"" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident
that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll
put the gun on the table.

LEE
I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you
be nice and get coffee for everybody.

They all sit around a fancy glass table except for Boris, who's getting the coffee,
and Monty, who's standing behind Lee's chair.

CLARENCE
Oh, Mr. Donowitz √

LEE
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.

CLARENCE
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you ""Coming Home in a Body Bag"" is one
of my favorite movies. After ""Apocalypse Now"" I think it's the best
Vietnam movie ever.

LEE
Thank you very much, Clarence.

CLARENCE
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. ""Sophie's
Choice"", ""Ordinary People"", ""Kramer vs. Kramer"", ""Gandhi"". All that
stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.

LEE
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.

CLARENCE
Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are
unwatchable movies from unreadable books.

Boris starts placing clear-glass coffee cups in front of everybody and fills
everybody's cup from a fancy coffee pot that he handles like an expert.

LEE
Clarence, there might be somebody somewhere that agrees with you more
than I do, but I wouldn't count on it.

Clarence is on a roll and he knows it.

CLARENCE
They ain't plays, they ain't books, they certainly ain't movies, they're films.
And do you know what films are? They're for people who don't like
movies. ""Mad Max"", that's a movie. ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"",
that's a movie. ""Rio Bravo"", that's a movie. ""Rumble Fish"", that's a
fuckin' movie. And, ""Coming Home in a Body Bag"", that's a movie. It was
the first movie with balls to win a lot of Oscars since the ""The Deer
Hunter"".

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

They're all listening to this.

DIMES
What's this guy doin'? Makin' a drug deal or gettin' a job on the ""New
Yorker""?

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

CLARENCE
My uncle Roger and uncle Cliff, both of which were in Nam, saw ""Coming
Home in a Body Bag"" and thought it was the most accurate Vietnam film
they'd ever seen.

LEE
You know, Clarence, when a veteran of that bullshit wars says that, it
makes the whole project worthwhile. Clarence, my friend, and I call you
my friend because we have similar interests, let's take a look at what you
have for me.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

NICHOLSON
Thank God.

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

Clarence puts the suitcase on the table.

CLARENCE
Lee, when you see this you're gonna shit.

BACK TO:

LOBBY

The four Wise-guys are at the desk.

LENNY
(quietly to the others)
What was the Jew-boy's name?

MARVIN
Donowitz, he said.

FRONT-DESK GUY
How can I help you, Gentlemen?

LENNY
Yeah, we're from Warner Bros. What room is Mr. Donowitz in?

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

Lee's looking over the cocaine and sampling it.

CLARENCE
Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot
more.

LEE
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.

CLARENCE
Me too, Boris.

Boris fills both of their cups. They both, calm as a lake, take cream and sugar.
All eyes are on them. Lee uses light cream and sugar, he begins stirring this
cup. Clarence uses very heavy cream and sugar.

LEE
(stirring loudly)
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?

CLARENCE
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.

Both are cool as cucumbers.

LEE
I have to hand it to you, this is not nose garbage, this is quality. Can Boris
make anybody a sandwich? I got all kinds of sandwich shit from Canters in
there.

ALABAMA
No thank you.

DICK
No. But thanks.

CLARENCE
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that
made me a little sick.

LEE
Where'd you go?

CLARENCE
A Norms in Van Nuys.

LEE
Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.

Lee continues looking at the merchandise.

Alabama writes something in her napkin with a pencil. She slides the napkin
over to Clarence. It says: ""You're so cool"" with a tiny heart drawn on the
bottom of it. Clarence takes the pencil and draws an arrow through the heart.
She takes the napkin and puts it in her pocket.

Lee looks up.

LEE
OK, Clarence, the merchandise is perfect. But, whenever I'm offered a deal
that's too good to be true, it's because it's a lie. Convince me you're on the
level.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

NICHOLSON
If he don't bite, we ain't got shit except posession.

DIMES
Convince him.

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

CLARENCE
Well, Lee, it's like this. You're getting the bargain of a lifetime because I
don't know what the fuck I'm doing. You're used to dealin' with
professionals. I'm not a professional. I'm a rank amateur. I could take that,
and I could cut it, and I could sell it a little bit at a time, and make a
helluva lot more money. But, in order to do that, I'd have to become a drug
dealer. Deal with cut-throat junkies, killers, worry about getting busted all
of the time. Just meeting you here today scares the shit outta me, and
you're not a junkie, a killer or a cop, you're a fucking movie-maker. I like
you, and I'm still scared. I'm a punk kid who picked up a rock in the street,
only to find out it's the Hope Diamond. It's worth a million dollars, but I
can't get the million dollars for it. But, you can. So, I'll sell it to you for a
couple a hundred thousand. You go to make a million. It's all found money
to me anyway. Me and my wife are minimum wage kids, two hundred
thousand is the world.

LEE
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.

CLARENCE
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'.
(to Elliot)
Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on
you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit.
(to Lee)
He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.

LEE
Why does he trust you?

CLARENCE
We grew up together.

LEE
If you don't know shit, ehy does he think you can sell it?

CLARENCE
I bullshitted him.

Lee starts laughing.

LEE
That's wild. This fucking guy's a madman. I love it. Monty, go in the other
room and get the money.

Clarence, Alabama and Dick exchange looks.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

Nicholson and Dimes exchange looks.

DIMES & NICHOLSON
Bingo!

BACK TO:

ELEVATOR

The four Wise-guys are coming up.

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

LEE
(pointing to Alabama)
What's your part in this?

ALABAMA
I'm his wife.

LEE
(referring to Dick)
How 'bout you?

DICK
I know Elliot.

LEE
And Elliot knows me. Tell me, Clarence, what department does you friend
work in?

Dick and Alabama panic.

CLARENCE
(without missing a beat)
Carson County Sheriffs.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

The internal affairs officers high five.

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

Monty brings in a briefcase of money and puts it down on the table.

LEE
Wanna count your money?

CLARENCE
Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.

BACK TO:

COPS' ROOM

They all stand.

DIMES
OK, boys. Let's go get 'em.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE √ LEE'S HOTEL ROOM √ BATHROOM √
DAY

Clarence steps inside the bathroom and shuts the door. As soon as it's shut he
starts doing the twist. He can't believe he's pulled it off. He goes to the toilet
and starts taking a piss. He turns and sees Elvis sitting on the sink.

ELVIS
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.

CLARENCE
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.

ELVIS
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.

CLARENCE
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.

ELVIS
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: ""I'll take that gun"", ""You'll
have to"".

CLARENCE
That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came
from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought,
that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

Everything's just as it was.

Sudenly, Nicholson, Dimes and the four Detectives break into the room with
guns drawn.

DIMES & NICHOLSON
Police! Freeze, you're all under arrest!

Everybody at the table stands up. Boris and Monty stand ready with the Uzis.

NICHOLSON
You two! Put the guns on the floor and back away.

MONTY
Fuck you! All you pigs put your guns on the floor and back away.

LEE
Monty, what are you talking about? So what they say.

DIMES
This is your last warning! Drop those fuckin' guns!

BORIS
This is your last warning! We could kill all six of ya and ya fuckin' know it!
Now get on the floor!

DICK
What the fuck am I doing here?

LEE
Boris! Everybody's gonna get killed! They're cops!

MONTY
So they're cops. Who gives a shit?

BORIS
Lee, something I never told you about me. I don't like cops.

DIMES
OK, let's everybody calm down and get nice. Nobody has to die. We don't
want it, and you don't want it.

LEE
We don't want it.

The four Wise-guys burst through the door, shotguns drawn, except for Frankie,
who has two .45 automatics, one in each hand.

Half of the cops spin around.

WURLITZER
Freeze!

LENNY
Who are you guys?

WURLITZER
Police.

DARIO
(to Lenny)
Do we get any extra if we have to kill cops?

BACK TO:

BATHROOM

Clarence and Elvis.

CLARENCE
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?

ELVIS
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.

CLARENCE
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?

ELVIS
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as
kissin' his ass.

CLARENCE
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved ""Coming Home in a Body Bag"".

ELVIS
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and
he can see that.

Elvis fixes Clarence's collar.

ELVIS
I like ya, Clarence. Always have.

BACK TO:

LEE'S ROOM

This is a Mexican stand-off if there ever was one. Gangsters on one end with
shotguns. Bodyguards with machine guns on the other. And cops with handguns
in the middle.

Dick's ready to pass out.

Alabama's so scared she pees on herself.

For Elliot, this has been the worst day of his life, and he's just about had it.

ELLIOT
Officer Dimes? Officer Dimes.

Dimes looks at Elliot.

ELLIOT
This has nothing to do with me anymore. Can I just leave and you guys just
settle it by yourselves?

DIMES
Elliot, shut the fuck up and stay put!

LEE
(to Elliot)
How did you know his name? How the fuck did he know your name? Why,
you fuckin' little piece of shit!

ELLIOT
Lee, understand, I didn't want to √

NICHOLSON
Shut the fuck up!

LEE
Well, I hope you're not planning on acting any time in the next twenty
years cause your career is over as of now! You might as weel burn you
SAG card! To think I treated you as a son! And you stabbed me in the
heart!

Lee can't control his anger any more. He grabs the coffee pot off the table and
flings hot coffee into Elliot's face. Elliot screams and falls to his knees,

Instinctively, Nicholson shoots Lee twice.

Alabama screams.

Boris lets loose with his Uzi, pinting Nicholson red with bullets.

DIMES
(screaming)
Cody!!!

Nicholson flies backwards.

Marvin fires his shotgun, hits Nicholson in the back, Nicholson's body jerks
back and forth then on the floor.

Clarence opens the bathroom door.

Dimes hits the ground firing.

A shot catches Clarence in the forehead.

Alabama screams.

Dario fires his sawed-off. It catches Clarence in the chest, hurling him on the
bathroom sink, smashing the mirror.

It might have been a stand-off before, but once the firing starts everybody either
hits the ground or runs for cover.

Dimes, Alabama, Dick, Lenny, an IA Officer and Wurtlitzer hit the ground.

Boris dives into the kitchen area.

Monty tips the table over.

Marvin dives behind the sofa.

Dario runs out of the door and down the hall.

With bullets flying this way and that, some don't have time to anything. Two IA
Officers are shot right away.

Frankie takes an Uzi hit. He goes down firing both automatics.

Elliot gets it from both sides.

Alabama is crawling across the floor, like a soldier in war, towards the
bathroom.

Clarence, still barely alive, lays on the sink, twitching. He moves and falls off.

Alabama continues crawling.

Marvin brings his sawed-off from behind the sofa and fires. The shotgun blast
hits the glass table and Monty. Monty stands up screaming.

The Cops on the ground let loose, firing into Monty.

As Monty gets hit, his finger hits the trigger of the Uzi, spreading fire all over
the apartment.

EXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE √ DAY

Cop cars start arriving in twos in front of the hotel.

BACK TO:

GUNFIGHT

Alabama crawling.

The suitcase full of cocaine is by Dick. Dick grabs it and tosses it in the air.
Marvin comes from behind the sofa and fires. The suitcase is hit in mid-air.
White powder goes everywhere. The room is enveloped in cocaine.

Dick takes this cue and makes a dash out the door.

An IA Officer goes after him.

Lenny makes a break for it.

Wurlitzer goes after him but is pinned down by Marvin.

Alabama reaches the bathroom and finds Clarence.

ALABAMA
Sweety?

Clarence's face is awash with blood.

CLARENCE
I... I can't see you... I've got blood in my eyes...

He dies.

Alabama tries to give him outh-to-mouth resuscitation.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE √ HALLWAY √ DAY

Dario runs down the hall, right into a cluster of uniformed police.

He fires his shotgun, hitting two, just before the others chop him to ribbons.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE √ ANOTHER HALLWAY

The hallway's empty but we hear footsteps approaching fast. Dick comes
around the corner, running as if on fire. Then we see the IA Officer turn the
same corner.

IA OFFICER
(aiming gun)
Freeze!

Dick does.

DICK
I'm unarmed!

IA OFFICER
Put your hands on your head, you son-of-a-bitch!

He does. Then, from off screen, a shotgun blast tears into the IA Officer,
sending him to the wall.

DICK
Oh shit.

He starts running again and runs out of frame, then Lenny turns around the
corner and runs down the hall.

Dick runs into the elevator area, he hits the buttons, he's trapped, it's like a box.

Lenny catches up. Dick raises his hands. Lenny aimes his sawed-off.

DICK
Look, I don't know who you are, but whatever it was that I did to you, I'm
sorry.

Two elevator doors on either side of them open.

Lenny looks at Dick. He drops his aim and says:

LENNY
Lotsa luck.

Lenny dives into one elevator car. Dick jumps into the other, just as the doors
close.

BACK TO:

HOTEL ROOM

The Mexican stand-off has become two different groups of two pinning each
other down.

Wurlitzer has Marvin pinned down behind the sofa and Dimes has Boris pinned
down in the kitchen.

In the bathroom, Alabama's pounding on Clarence's bloody chest, trying to get
his heart started. It's not working. She slaps him hard in the face a couple of
times.

ALABAMA
Wake up, goddamn it!

Dimes discards his handgun and pulls one of the sawed-off shotguns from the
grip of a dead Wise-guy.

Boris peeks around the wall to fire.

Dimes lets loose with a blast. A scream is heard.

BORIS
(off)
I'm shot! Stop!

DIMES
Throw out your gun, asshole!

The Uzi's tossed out.

Dimes goes to where Wurlitzer is.

DIMES
(to Marvin)
OK, black jacket! It's two against one now! Toss the gun and lie face down
on the floor or die like all you friends.

The shotgun's tossed out from behind the sofa.

INT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE √ ELEVATOR √ DAY

Dick's sitting on the ground, he can't believe any of this. The doors open on the
fourth floor. He runs out into the hallway.

HALLWAY

He starts trying the room doors for an open one.

DICK
Oh, God, if you just get me outta this I swear to God I'll never fuck up
again. Please, just let me get to ""T.J. Hooker"" on Monday.

STEWARDESS'S ROOM √ DAY

Dick steps in. THREE GORGEOUS GIRLS are doing a killer aerobics workout
to a video on TV. The music is so loud they're so into their exercises, they don't
hear Dick tiptoe behind them and crawl underneath the bed.

LEE'S ROOM

Boris has caught a lot of buckshots, but he'll live. He's lying on the kitchen
floor. Dimes stands over him. He has the sawed-off in his hand.

DIMES
Don't even give me an excuse, motherfucker.

Dimes pats him down for other weapons, there are none.

Wurlitzer puts the cuffs on Marvin and sits him down on the couch.

Dimes looks in the bathroom and sees the dead Clarence with Alabama crying
over him.

Dimes walks over to Wurlitzer.

DIMES
Everything's under control here.

WURLITZER
Sorry about Nicholson.

DIMES
Me too.

WURLITZER
I'm gonna go see what's goin' on outside.

DIMES
You do that.

Wurlitzer exits. Dimes grabs the phone.

LOBBY

Shotgun in hand, Lenny moves hurriedly down the lobby.

A COP yells out.

COP
You! Stop!

Lenny brings up his sawed-off and lets him have it. OTHER COPS rush
forward. Lenny grabs a woman standing by.

LENNY
Get back or I'll blow this bitch's brains to kingdom come!

LEE'S ROOM

Dimes on the phone talking with the department. Boris is still moving on the
floor. Marvin is sitting on the couch with his hands cuffed behind his back.
Alabama is crying over Clarence, then she feels something in his jacket. She
reaches in and pulls out his .38. She wipes her eyes. She holds the gun in her
hand and remembers Clarence saying:

CLARENCE
(off)
She's a sixteen-calibre kitten, equally equipped for killin' an' lovin'! She
carried a sawed-off shotgun in her purse, a black belt around her waist,
and the white-hot fire of hate in her eyes! Alabama Whitman is Pam Grier!
Pray for forgiveness, Rated R... for Ruthless Revenge!

Alabama steps out of the bathroom, gun in hand.

Marvin turns his head toward her. She shoots him twice.

Dimes, still on the phone, spins around in time to see her raise her gun. She
fires. He's hit in the head and flung to the floor.

She sees Boris on the kitchen floor.

ALABAMA
Bye-bye, Boris. Good luck.

BORIS
You too, cutie.

She starts to leave and then spots the briefcase full of money. She takes it and
walks out the door.

HALLWAY

The elevator opens and Wurlitzer steps out.

Alabama comes around the corner.

WURLITZER
Hey, you!

Alabama shoots him three times in the belly. She steps into the elevator, the
doors close.

LOBBY

Alabama enters the lobby and proceeds to walk out. In the background, COPS
are all over the place and Lenny is still yelling with the woman hostage.

LENNY
I wanna car here, takin' me to the airport, with a plane full of gas ready to
take me to Kilimanjaro and... and a million bucks!
(pause)
Small bills!

EXT. BEVERLY WILSHIRE √ PARKING LOT √ DAY

Alabama puts the briefcase in the trunk. She gets into the Mustang and drives
away.

INT. MUSTANG √ MOVING √ DAY

Alabama's driving fast down the freeway. The DJ on the radio is trying to be
funny. She's muttering to herself.

ALABAMA
I could have walked away. I told you that. I told you I could have walked
away. This is not my fault. I did not do this. You did this one hundred
percent to yourself. I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction of feeling bad. I
should laugh cause you don't deserve any better. I could get another guy
like that. I'm hot lookin'. What are you? Dead! Dumb jerk. Asshole. You're
a asshole, you're a asshole, you're a asshole. You wanted it all, didn't ya?
Didn't ya? Well watcha got now? You ain't got the money. You ain't got
me. You ain't even got your body anymore. You got nothin'. Nada. Zip.
Goose egg. Nil. Donut.

The song ""Little Arrows"" by Leapy Lee comes on the radio. Alabama breaks
down and starts crying. She pulls the car over to the side. The song continues.
She wipes her eyes with a napkin that she pulls out her jacket. She tosses it on
the dashboard. She picks up the .38 and sticks it in her mouth.

She pulls back hammer. She looks up and sees her reflection in the rear-view
mirror. She turns it the other way. She looks straight ahead. Her finger tightens
on the trigger. She sees the napkin on the dashboard. She opens it up and reads
it: ""You're so cool"".

She tosses the gun aside, opens up the trunk, and takes out the briefcase. She
looks around for, and finally finds, the ""Sgt. Fury"" comic book Clarence bought
her.

And with comic book in one hand, and briefcase in the other, Bama walks away
from the Mustang forever.

1917,ML1918,High On Fire,The Face of Oblivion,angry,"2 ContributorsPrince of Persia: The Sands of Time LyricsINT. FARAH'S BEDROOM – NIGHT
FARAH, a beautiful Indian Princess, lies asleep in bed. Translucent curtains billow in the breeze.
PRINCE (V.O.)
Most people think time is like a river that flows swift and sure in one direction. But I have seen the face of Time, and I can tell you... they are wrong.
Farah awakens suddenly with a gasp.

PRINCE (V.O.)
Time is an ocean in a storm.

EXT. JUNGLE – NIGHT

The PRINCE runs through a dense jungle, pushing aside leaves and branches. Grim determination on his face, as if he is on his way to save the world. In fact, he is.

As he runs, we hear his VOICE OVER:

PRINCE (V.O.)
You may wonder who I am and why I say this. Sit down, and I will tell you a tale like none that you have ever heard.

THE JUNGLE SKY

A FLAMING ARROW arcs high into the air.

EXT. INDIAN PALACE --- DAWN
KING SHAHRAMAN, 70, watches from an atoll on horseback. Beside him is the Prince. Below, an Indian Palace is under attack by Persian soldiers.

PRINCE (V.O.)
Know, first, that I am the son of Shahraman, a mighty king of Persia. On our way to Azad with a small company of men, we passed through India...

Swords and horsemen clash in the driving rain, Persian soldiers against Indian soldiers. Catapults hurl flaming projectiles. Part of the palace is on fire.

EXT. INSIDE PALACE GATES --- DAWN

A richly dressed Indian VIZIER, an obvious villain, sneaks up on the Indian Soldier guarding the main gate.

PRINCE (V.O.)
Where the promise of honor and glory tempted my father into a grievous error.
The Vizier draws a dagger, kills the startled soldier, and pulls the rope to open the gate.

EXT. INDIAN PALACE --- DAWN

The gate goes up. With a cry of triumph, the Persian soldiers swarm toward the open gate.

SHAHRAMAN
Now, my son!

Shahraman’s old eyes gleam with the lifelong love of war. Letting out a battle cry, he gallops down the hill. The young Prince gallops eagerly after him.

EXT. INSIDE PALACE GATES --- DAWN
Persian soldiers storm through the courtyard, overwhelming the surprised Indian soldiers.

Shahraman and the Prince gallop to a stop before the Vizier, who welcomes them. Fighting continues around them. (Note: The Vizier carries a STAFF with an unusual ornament.)
VIZIER
(obsequious)
Your Majesty, the Maharajah's treasure vaults lie within.

He points. The Prince's eyes follow his pointing finger to a burning wing of the palace.

VIZIER
I trust you will remember your promise...?

That's all the Prince needs to hear. He spurs his horse and gallops off in the direction indicated by the Vizier.

SHAHRAMAN
(chuckles proudly)
See how he rides! Like a warrior’s son.

EXT. PALACE COURTYARD --- DAWN

The Prince, on horseback, charges through the palace gates. Fires burn around him. Soldiers fight hand-to-hand, on horseback and on foot.

Enthralled by the sights of battle at close range, the Prince fails to notice the burning column behind him start to topple.

His horse jumps out of the way, just in time to avoid being crushed by the falling column. The Prince is thrown. Jumps to his feet, too late to catch his fleeing horse.
He is on foot, in the midst of battle. He reaches for his dagger --- realizes he's lost it: his thigh holster is empty.
Game Play : Indian Palace
A setting of great drama and chaos, with parts of the palace burning and collapsing, and hand-to-hand combat raging between Indian and Persian soldiers.
A cannonball blasts a hole in the palace wall. Entering, the Prince finds himself in the Maharajah’s treasure vault. The sounds of battle recede; the Prince is alone. In the center of the room is a giant HOURGLASS that seems to radiate a mysterious power.
Bypassing the hourglass, the Prince scales a giant elephant statue to reach the DAGGER OF TIME.

INT. TREASURE VAULT – MORNING

A sensuous close-up view of the DAGGER OF TIME. The jewels in the hilt gleam. Its blade is translucent.

The Prince approaches the dagger, takes it. Turns it in his hand; he is curious to notice that it contains sand.

PRINCE
Sand...

VIEW FROM ABOVE

High above the Prince, a massive stone gargoyle teeters...and starts to fall.

THE PRINCE

Unaware of the stone gargoyle plunging toward him, he notices a switch on the dagger's hilt. He presses it. SAND spills from the dagger onto the floor.

At the last second, the Prince looks up to see the gargoyle about to crush him. His eyes widen with the terror of certain death. But just then ---

REWIND!

The gargoyle springs back up, reversing its trajectory, and lands in its original position.

THE PRINCE

blinks, baffled as to what just happened.

As he is staring up at the gargoyle, it teeters, just as it did before, and starts to fall a second time.

This time, forewarned, the Prince jumps back out of the way. The gargoyle crashes harmlessly next to him.

He looks at the dagger. He still doesn't understand what happened --- but he's going to keep it. He sheathes the dagger in his empty thigh holster.

Just then, the walls start to shake around him. The treasure vault is about to collapse.

Game Play : Indian Palace, continued
The Prince runs for his life as the palace collapses around him, finally landing back in the Hourglass Room.

INT. HOURGLASS ROOM --- MORNING

The Prince dives and lands on the floor, covering his head with his arms to protect himself from falling debris.

When no more debris falls, he dares to lift his head... and finds himself confronted by a pair of royal boots, inches from his nose.

Looking up, he sees King Shahraman glaring down at him in disapproval. A most undignified position for a Prince.

The Prince saves the moment by quickly rolling to his feet, and proudly displaying the dagger.
PRINCE
Father, I have brought us honor and glory!

The Vizier is seized by a tubercular coughing fit that makes both Shahraman and the Prince look at him.

VIZIER
(when he recovers)
Your Majesty... You promised me my choice of the Maharajah's treasures.
(pointing)
That dagger...

The Prince protects the dagger possessively. Shahraman looks indulgent; he has a soft spot for his youngest son.

SHAHRAMAN
Surely you won’t deny the lad a souvenir of his first battle? You may have your choice of all the Maharajah's other treasures.
(an afterthought)
Except that hourglass.

WHIP PAN TO THE HOURGLASS, now being lifted with ropes by six Persian soldiers.

SHAHRAMAN (O.S.)
...That will make a fine gift for the Sultan of Azad, when we pass through his city.

The Vizier’s expression transforms into a look of hate.
SHAHRAMAN
(continuing, oblivious)
And some exotic animals for his menagerie... and a few dozen slave girls... Yes, that should be enough. I shall choose them myself.
BEHIND A COLUMN

While Shahraman’s speech continues, Farah, the beautiful young Indian girl from the first scene, peers around the column. Her large dark eyes widen with outrage.
SHAHRAMAN (O.S.)
(raising his voice)
I want no animals or maidens harmed  until I have chosen! Let it be known King Shahraman is merciful in victory!
A shadow passes over Farah. She whirls with a gasp to see TWO PERSIAN SOLDIERS standing menacingly behind her. On her terror-stricken face ---

CUT TO:

EXT. PERSIAN DESERT --- DAY

A magnificent royal procession of hundreds of men, horses and animals, crosses the white sands.

PRINCE (V.O.)
‘Trust not a man who has betrayed his master, nor take him into your own service... lest he betray you too.’

Illustrate this by panning from a caged tiger to the Indian Vizier riding alongside.

PRINCE (V.O.)
I learned the truth of this, to my sorrow, the day that we arrived in Azad as the Sultan's honored guests.
The next carriage contains veiled SLAVE GIRLS. Peering out through the slatted window is Farah, her eyes burning with determination. Though she has been captured as a slave girl, we sense she is not resigned to her fate.

CAMERA lingers on Farah a moment... then RISES to reveal the caravan’s destination: the splendid PALACE OF AZAD.

INT. RECEPTION HALL --- NIGHT

A splendid royal hall, lined with Persian men and women. Guards stand at attention. The roly-poly SULTAN OF AZAD steps down from his throne to greet King Shahraman (Prince and Vizier behind him).

SHAHRAMAN AND SULTAN
(simultaneously)
My friend!

They embrace.

SULTAN
Your visit brings joy and honor to my poor and humble dwelling. If only you had given me time to prepare a proper welcome!

SHAHRAMAN
(not to be outdone)
The glories of Azad are famed throughout the world. One cannot improve on perfection. And yet, I hope that in your palace there may still be room for a few paltry gifts from India.

Shahraman gestures. TWO DOZEN SLAVE GIRLS step forward in unison and bow to the Sultan with a flourish.

As CAMERA RACES down the row of slave girls, one of them surreptitiously lifts her eyes: Farah.

Shahraman gestures again. The Sultan’s eyes glitter with childlike anticipation as he turns to see...

ROARR!!! The Sultan jumps as a BENGAL TIGER strains his leash held by two Persian Guards. Two more tigers behind. The Sultan shivers pleasurably.

SULTAN
Magnificent specimens. And so many gifts! I am quite speechless!

SHAHRAMAN
Ah, the best is yet to come! I give you... The Sands of Time!

He turns, gestures with a flourish to the Hourglass. The velvet cloth covering it flies up, lifted to the ceiling by a rope.

SHAHRAMAN
May the friendship between our kingdoms endure as long as Time itself!

The Sultan approaches the Hourglass, studies it with fascination. The Slave Girls retreat to the far end of the hall.

SULTAN
The Sand... Why does it glow?

SHAHRAMAN
(he has no idea)
Er, um...

VIZIER (O.S.)
I can tell you.

Shahraman and the Sultan turn in surprise; it is the Indian Vizier who has spoken. He takes this opportunity to step forward, with a dry cough.

VIZIER
Inside the hourglass is a marvel that no living man has seen.

The Sultan's eyes light up --- only to be disappointed when the Vizier adds:

VIZIER
Alas, I cannot open it. Only the Dagger can unlock the Sands of Time... and it belongs to a greater one than I.

He points suddenly to the Prince --- who is discomfited to find himself the center of attention.

VIZIER
A young Prince dearer to his father than all the wealth of India. Perhaps he will oblige...?

Farah’s eyes widen with horror as she sees ---

HER POV: FAST TRACK-IN, THE LENGTH OF THE HALL, TO CLOSE-UP OF THE DAGGER on the Prince's thigh.

FARAH
No!

THE PRINCE,

happy to oblige, draws the dagger.

FARAH

rushes toward him. But there's a lot of distance to cover.

FARAH
No! Stop!

THE PRINCE

Too far away to notice Farah, he steps to the hourglass, thrusts the dagger into the slot provided for that purpose, and twists it --- instantly triggering TIME-BLUR SLOW-MOTION EFFECT.

FARAH

running toward him, in slow motion...

FARAH
NOOOOO!!!!

THE PRINCE

becomes aware of Farah's distorted cry. In slow motion, he turns, sees her running toward him...

As suddenly as it started, END TIME-BLUR SLOW-MOTION EFFECT.

Sand pours out of the hourglass onto the floor. The sand is bright white, almost glowing.

Farah stops running. It's too late.

Shahraman, the Sultan and Vizier stare at the flowing sand. The Vizier's eyes gleam with joyful expectation.

The room begins to shake.

Worried eyes rise to the vaulted ceiling as the shaking increases. Dust and bits of stone rain down.

The Sands of Time creep along the floor, slowly, like a dryice fog. The Prince looks down uneasily as the sand swirls around his feet, Shahraman's and the Vizier's.

The sand cloud rises around the Vizier. He takes a step back, raising his staff, and speaks imperious words of command in a foreign tongue:

VIZIER
(in Sanskrit)
‘Sands of Time, Back!’

The ornament on the Vizier’s staff FLASHES, repelling the sand cloud. Others in the room are not so lucky.

The Sultan shrinks uncomfortably from the sand cloud rising around him. Looks to Shahraman for reassurance.

SULTAN
Is it meant to do this?

KING SHAHRAMAN

sees the Sands creeping up his legs. He tries to push it away, then draws his sword, trying to fight it. The sand  sucks the water from his body, transforming him into a hideous SANDMAN. A WOMAN SCREAMS.

PRINCE
FATHER!!!

In quick succession, the Sultan and his two nearest BODYGUARDS are likewise transformed into Sandmen.

SCREAMING MEN AND WOMEN

run from the pursuing sands, as chunks of stone rain down from the ceiling. Farah among them.

THE PRINCE

looks down in confusion at himself. Why has he been spared? His Dagger is glowing, repelling the sand cloud, just as the Vizier’s ornament did.

THE VIZIER

steps toward the Prince. Stretches out his hand.

VIZIER
Give me the dagger!

PRINCE
(fearful)
No!!

VIZIER
You have unleashed the Sands of Time. I can undo what you have done. Give it to me!

The Prince backs away in horror, shaking his head...
Game Play : Royal Chambers
As the Prince tries to escape, he is repeatedly attacked by hosts of Sandmen—the palace’s inhabitants, transformed by Sands of Time into hideous monsters. The Dagger proves essential to his survival, since it is the only weapon that can vanquish them.

INT. PASSAGEWAY --- NIGHT

Farah grabs the Prince by the hand and yanks him into the passageway; the door slams shut behind them, sealing out a snarling Sandman.
Farah faces the startled Prince. She puts her hand out.

FARAH
Give me the Dagger.

The Prince stares at her for a moment. Sands of Time are swirling in the air around both of them; so why is she spared? Her MEDALLION is glowing, repelling the sand cloud. Like his dagger. Like the Vizier’s staff.

The Prince pushes Farah against the wall. His eyes are wild and traumatized.

PRINCE
Who are you?

FARAH
I am Farah, the daughter of the Maharajah from whom you stole it. This is your doing.

PRINCE
(beserk)
I saw my father turned to sand!

FARAH
And we will share his fate, if you do not give me the Dagger, to undo what you have done!

PRINCE
Your traitorous Vizier used the same words.
(He pushes away from Farah)
From now on, I trust no one but myself.
With a terrifying ROAR, TWO SANDMEN land nearby. Farah shrinks back in fear, as the Prince draws his sword.

PRINCE
Run!

Farah doesn’t need to be told twice. She scrambles through a crack in the wall. The Prince tries to follow, but is too big to fit. Giving up, he turns to face the Sandmen.

Farah’s frightened eyes peer at him from the other side of the crack.

PRINCE
Go back to the reception hall; wait for me there. GO!!!

And blocks a mighty blow as the Sandmen attack him.
Game Play : Royal Chambers
En route to the reception hall, the Prince helps a guard activate the palace’s military defense system.

INT. CONTROL ROOM – NIGHT

As the Prince throws his lever, the Guard simultaneously throws his. The DEFENSE MECHANISM rumbles to life.

SERIES OF QUICK CUTS showing traps activating in different locations throughout the palace:

QUICK CUT --- A PORTCULLIS

slams shut.

QUICK CUT --- SPIKES

spring out of the floor, skewering a Sandman, who explodes into a cloud of sand.

QUICK CUT --- ANOTHER PORTCULLIS

slams shut.

QUICK CUT --- BLADES

whip out of the wall, then retract, passing so close to the camera that it shakes.

INT. CONTROL ROOM --- NIGHT

The defense mechanism finishes its work, and comes to a stop. The Prince and Guard stand watching it.
Game Play : Royal Chambers
The Prince soon regrets having activated the defense system, as it makes his progress through the palace much more dangerous.

INT. RECEPTION HALL --- NIGHT

The Prince appears on a balcony overlooking the Reception Hall. He sees Farah surrounded by an army of menacing SAND PEOPLE.

PRINCE
Farah!!

She looks up at him... then returns her attention to the desperate fight. Reloading her bow, she shoots arrow after arrow.

One SAND GUARD takes an arrow in the chest... and keeps on coming.

THE PRINCE

jumps off the balcony, does a spectacular walling and rebound to land between Farah and the Sand People. He draws his sword and dagger.

PRINCE
Farah, get back!

Game Play : Reception Hall
The Prince fights the sand creatures, with Farah’s help, until only four are left.

INT. RECEPTION ROOM --- NIGHT

The Prince turns to face the new enemies.

THE FOUR ENEMIES

step forward. Three of them wear the uniforms of King Shahraman's personal bodyguards. The fourth wears the uniform of Shahraman himself.

He is THE SAND KING.

FARAH AND THE PRINCE

gasp in horror.

PRINCE
FATHER!!

THE SAND KING

GROWLS... a hideous, inhuman sound. Though he resembles King Shahraman, he shows absolutely no recognition of his son. His face is as cold and dead as that of any sand creature. He steps forward to fight the Prince.

Game Play : Reception Hall
The Prince fights and kills the Sand King.

INT. RECEPTION HALL --- NIGHT

The Prince and the Sand King SCREAM together in rage and pain as sand flows from the Sand King into the Prince`s dagger. And then it’s over.

WIDE SHOT – HIGH ANGLE

The great hall, empty of enemies. The Prince falls to his knees and stays there.

Farah, at a distance, approaches him timidly. (A Sand Vortex is forming about 15 meters away, unnoticed by either of them.)

THE PRINCE

On his knees, grieving.

Farah comes up behind him. Hesitant, awkward.

FARAH
I'm sorry.

At first it seems the Prince has not heard her. Then, he speaks without turning. His voice is expressionless.

PRINCE
Why?

FARAH
(somewhat taken aback by his coldness)
I know what it is to lose a father.

Now the Prince turns. His eyes are like ice.

PRINCE
That was not my father.

He stands. Sheathes his sword and dagger.

He turns. Sees the VORTEX that has formed behind them.

His eyes narrow in determination. He strides toward the vortex. Farah is terrified. To her it looks like he’s about to commit suicide.

FARAH
What are you doing?... Wait!
STOP!!

Ignoring her, the Prince PLUNGES into the Vortex. He lets out a cry of pleasure and pain as huge quantities of sand flow into his dagger from all sides.

WHAM!! The Prince finds himself levitated a meter off the floor, in fetal position. Farah stares in astonishment.

EXT. PALACE --- DAY (VISION EFFECT)

Establishing shot of the palace. Camera zeroes in on the TOWER OF DAWN, flies toward it at increasing speed, and into a window...

INT. TREASURE VAULT --- DAY (VISION EFFECT)

The SAND GRIFFIN’s great wings flap slowly as it lowers the Hourglass into the center of the room. The Vizier stands nearby, supervising this operation.

EXT. TOWER OF DAWN --- DAY (VISION EFFECT)

The Sand Griffin flies out the window and glides down in spirals toward earth.

END VISION.

INT. RECEPTION HALL --- NIGHT

The Prince, curled up in fetal position on the cold marble floor, awakens. A shadow passes over him. He looks up...

And snatches the Dagger from the floor where it fell, moments before Farah is able to grab it. The Prince rolls to his feet. Farah is caught red-handed.

PRINCE
So! This is the thanks I get for saving your life!

FARAH
You don't understand! I need that Dagger, to undo ---

PRINCE
‘To undo what I have done.’ Truly, you must think I am a fool!

FARAH
You are right to be cautious. But fight as bravely as you may, you cannot defeat this enemy. The Sands will spread. They will consume... everything.
She lays her hand on his arm. Her big, dark eyes look straight into his. The Prince weakens.

FARAH
I have heard it said that you are kind as well as brave. Please believe me. Help me find the Hourglass.

PRINCE
(reluctantly)
It is in the Sultan's treasure vault atop the Tower of Dawn.

FARAH
How do you know that?

PRINCE
I just know. Come with me, then, if you insist. But I warn you, I move pretty fast. You’d better keep up.

Farah is already running off. She climbs out the broken window and drops from sight.

EXT. PALACE --- NIGHT

Farah runs and jumps along the rocks, quick and agile.

Behind Farah, the Prince emerges from the hole in the palace wall. Farah turns, beckons for the Prince to follow.

FARAH
Come on!
Game Play : Zoo / Barracks
Together, the Prince and Farah make their way through the moonlit ruins of the Sultan’s fabled zoo. In the darkness prowl Sand Tigers and other frightening beasts, whom the Prince must fight.
Escaping from the zoo, they pass through the military barracks, and emerge onto a bridge.
EXT. BRIDGE --- NIGHT

A concrete bridge extends between two towers, a garden far below. Farah and the Prince appear at one end.

PRINCE
This way!

CAMERA does a 180°, showing a portcullis open at the other end of the bridge. The Prince runs INTO SHOT, across the bridge, Farah right behind him.

FARAH

A shadow passes over her. She stops. Looks up ---

FARAH
(screaming)
Look out!!

Warned, the Prince turns; dives out of the way just in time to avoid being clipped by the Sand Griffin’s wing. The blow SHATTERS the bridge between them, creating an 8m gap. Farah scrambles to safety on her side of the gap. The Prince rolls to his feet and draws his sword, as the Sand Griffin circles and flies back toward him...
Game Play : Broken Bridge
The Prince fights off the Sand Griffin, and is again rewarded with a vision.
INT. CISTERNS --- NIGHT (VISION EFFECT)

DESCENDING into a water chute...

MOVING through cavern passageways...

DRIFTING across the surface of a vast water tank...

SAND EUNUCHS AND COURTESANS, a terrifying vision, turn in unison to face us...

EXT. BROKEN BRIDGE --- NIGHT

Farah comes into focus on the other side of the bridge. Her voice seems to come from a great distance.

FARAH
Wake up! Please wake up!

The Prince, lying on the ground, stirs. Gets up.

FARAH
(gasps)
Your arm!

The Prince looks at his left arm --- it's bare and bleeding, the sleeve partially torn off by the Sand Griffin's claws. He tears off the sleeve and tosses it away. He extends one arm to Farah.

PRINCE
Farah, jump!

Their eyes meet. Farah trusts him. She jumps.

At the last moment, the Prince catches her by the arm. Farah hangs struggling in space...

WIDE SHOT

showing the two small figures hanging precariously from the broken bridge. Vertigo!

FARAH AND PRINCE

The Prince pulls Farah up to safety.

As he does, their faces are brought close together. For a moment it seems the Prince might kiss her... or say something nice...
A MECHANICAL NOISE behind them. The Prince turns to see the portcullis starting to close.

Game Play : Broken Bridge
The Prince and Farah sprint along the bridge toward the closing gate.

EXT. BROKEN BRIDGE --- NIGHT

Farah reaches the slowly descending portcullis first; ducks under it. Turning, she shouts to the Prince, who is still running:

FARAH
I'll raise the gate for you!

She steps to the wall; grabs a lever ---

The Prince guesses what's about to happen. Sprinting toward the gate, he shouts ---

PRINCE
NO!!

Too late. Farah throws the lever. Instantly, the gate SLAMS SHUT in the Prince's face just as he reaches it.

Farah throws the lever again. It does nothing. The Prince glares at her through the bars.

PRINCE
You go on down. I’ll find another way in.

Farah gives him a look of humiliation... then turns and runs off into the tower, until she has disappeared from sight.
Game Play : Ext. Tower / Int. Baths
With some difficulty, the Prince rejoins Farah in the royal baths just in time to save her from a bevy of Sand Eunuchs and Sand Courtesans.

INT. HAREM --- MORNING

A BLUR gradually comes into focus, becomes Farah (dripping wet) stroking the Prince's hair. He is lying on the tiled floor with his head in her lap.

FARAH
(desolate)
Don’t leave me... My love... Please don’t leave me.

The Prince’s eyes flicker open.

PRINCE
What did you call me?

Embarassed at having revealed her feelings, Farah briskly jumps to her feet, allowing the Prince’s head to bang against the tiled floor.

FARAH
It doesn’t matter. The important thing is, I know how we can reach the Tower of Dawn.

PRINCE
(wincing, rubs his head)
Of course. The hourglass.

FARAH
You said it was in the Sultan’s treasure vault atop the tower. I hope you’re right. It takes two to lower the bridge. One at the top of each watchtower.

PRINCE
How do you know?

Farah’s big brown eyes gaze innocently into his.

FARAH
‘I just know.’

The Prince is uncertain whether she is making fun of him.

PRINCE
All right. But this time, stay with me, and pay attention. I can't spend all day chasing after you.

Farah looks like she wants to make an angry retort. But the Prince is already moving on.
Game Play : Hall of Learning / Barracks
Farah and the Prince solve the mirror puzzle of the Hall of Learning, and escape onto the ramparts that connect the two watchtowers. The Prince sees Farah safely into her watchtower. He himself is not so lucky.

EXT. RAMPARTS --- DAY

As the Prince runs, the stone floor starts to crumble beneath his feet.

He turns, runs back. Too late. Falling, he tries to grab the crumbling ledge. It breaks away.

He plunges into the darkness of a stone shaft. A rain of rocks accompanies him. Falling past a ledge, he tries to grab it; his fingers slide off.

INT. DUNGEON --- DAY

WHAM! The Prince hits the stone floor. As he is getting up, a ROCK falls on his back, knocking him flat.

FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

The Prince opens his eyes. He is in a dungeon, amid debris. Daylight streams in through a small barred window. And through the hole in the ceiling, high above.

Painfully, the Prince sits up. Rubs his head. He winces as he rises to his feet.

Grimly, he strips off his other torn sleeve; tosses it aside.
Game Play : Prison / Forge / Barracks
The Prince escapes from the dungeon, and uses a catapult to smash his way into the watchtower. As he throws his lever, Farah, in the other watchtower, throws hers… lowering the bridge to the Tower of Dawn.

EXT. TOWER OF DAWN --- DAY

As Farah and the Prince run across the bridge...

WHAM!!! The bridge shakes as the Sand Griffin lands, barring their way.

Farah backs away, drawing her bow. The Prince draws his sword to fight. The Sand Griffin bats him with a powerful wing, sending him flying back into the courtyard.

EXT. COURTYARD --- DAY
The Prince lands, stunned. WHAM! The Sand Griffin lands in front of him.

The Prince gets warily to his feet. It’s going to be a fight, and one he really isn’t looking forward to.

FARAH
Be careful!
Game Play : Tower of Dawn Courtyard
The Prince defeats the Sand Griffin and is again rewarded with a vision.

EXT. TOWER OF DAWN --- DAY

The Prince trembles as huge quantities of sand flow into the dagger from all sides. The dagger glows with a bright light.

INT. TOMB --- NIGHT (VISION EFFECT)

Farah looms into view, cold determination in her eyes. She reaches toward CAMERA...

THE DAGGER

lies beside a heap of the Prince's clothes, sword and sandals. Farah reaches for it...

EXT. TOWER OF DAWN --- DAY

The Prince awakens to find his head in Farah's lap; she is tenderly stroking his hair. In a flash he draws his dagger, scrambling to his feet. He faces her like an enemy. His eyes are wild with paranoia.

FARAH
It's all right! It's me!

Confused, the Prince looks at the dagger in his hand. If she wanted to take it, she could have.

FARAH
(with infinite tenderness)
It's me!

The Prince hesitates... then pockets the dagger. Farah takes his hand, guides him toward the open gate of the next room.

FARAH
Look! At last we’re here! The Tower of Dawn!
Eagerly, she runs past him toward the open door. The Prince looks after her suspiciously. His visions have never lied to him before...
Game Play : Tower of Dawn
The Prince and Farah reach the treasure vault at the top of the Tower of Dawn, where the Vizier has brought the Hourglass.

INT. HOURGLASS VAULT --- DAY

The Prince lands on top of the hourglass. Farah, excited, calls to him from below.

FARAH
You did it! Do you see the dome atop the hourglass?

The Prince looks. Sees the bubble of a glass dome just as she described it.

FARAH
Take the dagger. Strike it into the center of the dome!

The Prince draws his dagger, ready to obey. He looks at Farah ---

QUICK CUT --- VISION FLASHBACK

Farah looms into view, cold determination in her eyes, reaching toward camera...

BACK TO SCENE

The Prince looks at the dagger in his hand. Looks down at Farah; she is standing below, looking up at him.

PRINCE
(suspiciously)
Why does the Vizier want the dagger?

FARAH
What? Go on --- do it!

The Prince hesitates. He lowers the dagger.

PRINCE
You have every reason to hate me.

FARAH
What are you talking about?

PRINCE
My father's army sacked your palace... captured you as a slave. Now you want me to trust you.

FARAH
(desperately)
Please. There’s no time!

The Prince turns. Farah turns. CAMERA WHIPS following their gaze to ---

THE VIZIER

stands in the entrance to the Hourglass Room. His eyes blaze. He raises his staff, a terrifying sorcerer.

VIZIER
(in Sanskrit)
‘Winds of the desert, blow! Blow!
Blow!!’

Even as he speaks, WIND stirs the room...

THE PRINCE

atop the hourglass, is suddenly BLOWN across the room. Hits the wall, sprawls on the floor under a window. He's missed his chance.

FARAH
(anguished scream)
NOOOO!!!!

THE VIZIER

His staff ornament GLOWS, a nimbus of wizardly light protecting him from the howling winds and blowing SAND. He advances on the Prince. Stretches out his hand.

VIZIER
Give me the dagger!

FARAH

grabs hold of a pillar, clings to it desperately. But the wind is too strong; it breaks her grip. With a cry, she sails across the room.

The Prince lunges, grabs her hand just in time to save her from being blown out the window. With his other hand, he grasps a pillar.

FARAH
(desperately)
The dagger! He must not get the dagger!

The Vizier advances determinedly. As he reaches out for his prize, the Prince suddenly lets go of the pillar. The surprised Vizier's hand closes on empty air, as the Prince and Farah fly out the window.
Game Play : Sandstorm
Blown across the parapets by the howling sandstorm, the Prince and Farah manage to find shelter.

INT. TOMB --- DAY (SANDSTORM)

The door SHUTS behind the Prince and Farah, sealing out the howling winds. TORCHES flame on, illuminating a mausoleum.

The Prince’s gaze flies to the stone slab in the center of the room. His eyes widen in supersti[ti]ous fear.

PRINCE
A tomb!
Farah whirls to face the Prince in bewildered anger. All is lost now --- and it’s his fault.

FARAH
You were there! The dagger was in your hand! Why did you hesitate?

The Prince has no reply. He knows he screwed up.

FARAH
You think you’re cleverer than everybody. But you’re just like the rest of them... those soldiers... All they can do is fight, destroy. Why did I trust you?!?

The Prince slumps down onto the tomb, head in hands. His despair is obvious.

Farah sees his distress. Her eyes fill. She sits beside him, places her hand tenderly on his shoulder.

FARAH
(forlorn, plaintive – she loves him)
Why didn’t you trust me?
The Prince looks up at her.

Farah looks back at him as if she wants to be kissed. She has never been more beautiful.

As if in a dream, the Prince leans toward her...

THE TORCHES GO OUT. TOTAL BLACKNESS. Scuffling sounds.

FARAH
Ow!

PRINCE
Sorry.

More scuffling sounds.

FARAH
(in sudden fear)
Where are you?!

PRINCE
I’m right here.

FARAH
Hold my hand. Don’t let go.

Silence. Nestling sounds. Breathing.

FARAH
I didn’t mean what I said.

PRINCE
(miserably)
No, you’re right. All that’s happened is my doing. I wanted honor and glory... I brought this on us.

In the darkness Farah puts her arms around him, holds him.

FARAH
You are brave and good. If this tomb is to be ours... at least the Dagger will be buried with us. And... we are together.

In the silence...

FARAH
What is it?

PRINCE
Nothing.

FARAH
You’re trembling!

PRINCE
(claustrophobic)
I just don’t like close spaces. There must be some way out of here.

Silence.

FARAH
When I was small, my mother taught me a secret word. She said that when I was afraid, all I had to do was speak that word and a magic door would open.
(pause)
I’ve never told that to anybody.

PRINCE
I can see why. It’s the most childish thing I’ve ever heard of.
(pause)
What was the word?
FARAH (O.S.)
‘Kakolookiyam.’

As she says the words, there is a noise like stone sliding against stone. More scuffling sounds.

PRINCE (O.S.)
You did that. Didn’t you?

No reply.

PRINCE (O.S.)
Farah?

The TORCHES ILLUMINATE again, revealing the room. The Prince is alone. The slab has been moved.
Game Play : Magic Cavern
In a dreamlike sequence, the Prince descends a flight of stairs into the tomb, and finds Farah in a place that is not quite real.

INT. MAGIC CAVERN
Farah is already in the room, staring with delight at something off-camera. As the Prince comes up beside her, she takes his hand.

FARAH
It’s beautiful.

They both stand there staring at the same incredible sight. Farah grins suddenly with childlike delight. She runs offscreen. We HEAR A SPLASH.

FARAH IN THE POOL

Farah surfaces in a tiled pool, from which steam rises invitingly.

FARAH
Come on!

THE PRINCE

advances in disbelief, taking in their surroundings.

A table with a jug of wine and fresh fruit. A luxurious bed with silk pillows and draperies. Hundreds of lit candles illuminate a room fit for a prince and princess’s honeymoon.

The Prince descends the tiled steps into the pool. As he approaches, Farah swims backward, treading water. A slight teasing smile on her lips.

As the Prince exits frame, HOLD on the empty wall. The flickering candlelight casts SILHOUETTES of Farah and the Prince on the wall.

SILHOUETTES ON THE WALL

The Prince advances, waist-high in the water. Farah treads water with only her head visible.

Then Farah stands. Faces the Prince. Takes off whatever she’s wearing. We only see their shadows.

PRINCE
(with hushed reverence)
Kakolookiyam.

The shadows embrace, kiss.

FADE OUT.

INT. TOMB --- DAY (AFTER SANDSTORM)

The Prince awakens with a start, as if from a dream. As he looks around the room, his eyes fall on ---

His clothing and sandals, in a heap on the floor. No dagger. And no sword.

It was no dream.
Game Play : Tomb
In the cold light of morning, the tomb is just a plain mausoleum, with no magic stairway. Farah is gone. The Prince finds the way out.
EXT. SAND DRIFT --- DAY

The Prince climbs out of a sand drift; shakes off sand. He stands there blinking incredulously into the bright daylight.

WHAT HE SEES

PANORAMIC VIEW of the entire palace buried in sand. Only the highest minarets, including the upper part of the Tower of Dawn, are visible. The rest is buried.

THE PRINCE

The SHRIEK of a Sand Bird attracts his attention. He looks up to see Farah climbing the Tower of Dawn with grim determination. She holds the Prince's dagger in one hand, his old sword --- too heavy for her --- in the other.

PRINCE
Farah! No!

She glances back over her shoulder --- then climbs on, ignoring him. SAND BIRDS circle her like vultures.
Game Play : Tower of Dawn
Beset by Sand Birds, the Prince climbs the tower after Farah, and finds a magic sword to replace the one she stole. Though handicapped by not having the dagger, he manages to reach the top of the tower…
EXT. TOWER OF DAWN ROOFTOP – DAY

Farah faces the Sand Giffin.

The Dagger in one hand, she awkwardly swings the heavy sword with the other. The Griffin SNARLS; lunges at her. Farah holds it off.

THE PRINCE

reaches the top and is horrified by the sight.

PRINCE
FARAH!!

Farah turns at the sound of his voice. The Griffin strikes her a mighty blow with its claw, knocking the sword from her hand and smashing a hole in the roof.

The roof caves in beneath Farah’s feet. As she falls, she manages to grab the edge of the hole. She still has the Dagger.

The Prince runs toward her...

Farah desperately tries to climb back up to safety...

Just as the Prince reaches Farah, a large chunk of roof breaks off and she falls. The Prince lunges and grabs the dagger in her hand --- by the blade.

The Prince grimaces with determination. His grip tightens on the blade; he is bearing Farah’s entire weight. That’s got to hurt.

A thin line of blood trickles from his fist. A drop lands on Farah’s cheek.

She looks at him. In her eyes we see love, understanding... and, finally, peace.

FARAH
(a whisper)
Kakolookiyam.

PRINCE
Farah, no!

She lets go of the dagger. And falls.

The Prince scrambles to the edge of the hole. Looks down. His expression is pure horror.

WHAT HE SEES: Farah lying dead at the bottom of the hole, far below in the Hourglass Room. A drop of blood on her cheek.

THE SAND GRIFFIN

strikes the Prince from behind, sending him sprawling. With a snarl, the monster advances on him.

The Prince’s expression transforms to grim determination. Drawing his sword, he rises to his feet to face the Sand Griffin. This is going to be the fight of his life.

Game Play : Tower of Dawn
The Prince defeats the Sand Griffin for the last time, and descends into the Hourglass Room…

INT. HOURGLASS ROOM --- DAY

Farah lies motionless amid the debris of the fallen rooftop. The Prince rushes to her side, lifts her in his arms. She is dead.

PRINCE
No. No.

Lost in grief, the Prince fails to notice the shadow passing over him, as the Vizier steals up on him from behind...

The Prince whirls with lightning speed. Before the Vizier can strike, the Prince snatches his staff and flings it away. In an instant the Vizier is flat on his back, the Prince crouched over him like a tiger, eyes blazing, dagger raised to kill.

VIZIER
(between gasps)
The girl... is unimportant. Give me the dagger... and I will give you power such as no king since  Suleyman has dreamed of. Eternal Life... will be yours.

The Prince’s eyes narrow with hatred.

PRINCE
Live forever... when those I loved are dead, and I to blame! I choose Death.

The Vizier gleams with anticipation, fully expecting the Prince to strike the dagger into his heart. Oddly, this prospect seems to fill the Vizier not with fear, but exaltation. But before we can wonder why...

Instead of striking the fatal blow, the Prince vaults off the Vizier and runs up the wall, from which he executes a brilliant rebound, landing on top of the hourglass.

Standing atop the hourglass, the Prince raises the dagger high, blazing with determination.

The Vizier realizes what's about to happen. His eyes go wide with terror ---

VIZIER
NO!!!!!!

The Prince PLUNGES the dagger into the center of the sun. A BLINDING BURST OF LIGHT. Like a nuclear blast.

THE BIGGEST REWIND OF ALL.

PRINCE (V.O.)
Bravely I had fought, and slain my enemies. Honor and glory were mine. But though I fight until the desert sands themselves were red with blood... I could not bring back the dead.
It starts out slow: the dagger comes up out of the hourglass, the Prince reverses his jump and walling move...

...then faster: Farah rises up out of the caved-in roof, which reassembles...

...Faster and faster, a jumble of fragmented images from the game, hours now compressed into seconds...

...at last slowing again to viewable speed, as the Prince gallops backwards through a battle between Indian and Persian soldiers...

INT. FARAH'S BEDROOM --- NIGHT

Farah awakens in bed with a gasp.

INT. TENT --- NIGHT

At the same instant, the Prince is likewise startled awake.

Clutched in his hand is the Dagger. He looks at it as if seeing it for the first time. Then looks around, getting his bearings. He is in a small tent. NIGHT SOUNDS.

EXT. MILITARY ENCAMPMENT --- NIGHT

The Prince emerges from his tent and looks around.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL that his tent is one of a hundred like it. The Persian Army is camped on an Indian plain. We see horses tied up, a few Persian soldiers on guard. The rest of the army is asleep in their tents.

Hearing voices, the Prince sneaks up on a larger tent nearby, and eavesdrops. We SEE SHADOWS of Shahraman and a Soldier inside.

SOLDIER (O.S.)
...And at dawn, we march.

SHAHRAMAN (O.S.)
A great deal depends upon this traitor. If he should fail?

SOLDIER (O.S.)
Your Majesty, he will signal with a flaming arrow shot into the air. When we see it, we attack. And not before.

The Prince backs away from the tent... turns, and runs off into the night.

EXT. JUNGLE --- NIGHT

The PRINCE runs through a dense jungle, pushing aside branches. Grim determination is on his face, as if he is on his way to save the world. In fact, he is.

The Prince reaches the edge of the jungle, and pauses, pushing aside leaves...

WHAT HE SEES

The Maharajah's palace compound, lying just beyond the edge of the jungle.

INT. FARAH'S BEDROOM --- NIGHT

Farah, awakened, gets out of bed in her nightgown. Pushing aside the translucent curtains, she walks to the edge of her balcony and looks out. NIGHT SOUNDS.

WHAT SHE SEES

The edge of the jungle (reverse POV of what the Prince saw in previous shot).

FARAH

Hearing a sound, she whirls suddenly with a frightened gasp to see the Prince standing on her balcony.

PRINCE
Do not be afraid.

Farah shrinks back as the Prince advances on her. She is very much afraid --- but her expression suggests that if he attacks her, she'll fight back anyway.

Her eyes widen in fear as the Prince draws a dagger. To her surprise, instead of attacking, he offers it to her, handle first.

PRINCE
This belongs to you.

Farah looks at the dagger. To her confusion, she recognizes it. Her hand flies unconsciously to touch the medallion at her throat, an instinctive gesture.

FARAH
The Dagger of Time! But it is locked away within my father's treasure vault! How ---

PRINCE
Most people think time is like a river that flows swift and sure in one direction. But I have seen the face of Time, and I can tell you... they are wrong. Time is an ocean in a storm.

Farah looks at him with the first sign of interest.

PRINCE [O.S.]
You may wonder who I am and why I say this. Sit down, and I will tell you a tale like none that you have ever heard.

Farah sits down on a pillow. On her listening face, DISSOLVE TO...

EXT. MAHARAJAH'S PALACE --- DAWN

As the Prince's talking voice fades out, we HEAR PRINCE'S VOICE-OVER, as we have heard it throughout the game:

PRINCE [O.S.]
...And that is why I have come. To warn you and your father to arrest this treacherous Vizier before he betrays you, and brings ruin on us all.

INT. FARAH'S BEDROOM --- DAWN

Farah sits listening to the Prince finish his story, which has taken him all night to tell.

PRINCE
His signal is a flaming arrow shot into the air. Prevent him, and my father's army will know the traitor has been unmasked. They will turn back.

His voice and expression plead with her to believe him. Farah still seems undecided... Then, a DRY COUGH from the shadows makes them both turn.

VIZIER
A wild tale, indeed. I have a simpler version.

The Vizier steps out of the shadows.

VIZIER
A Persian soldier, lusting for glory, entered the chambers of the Maharajah's daughter and was slain --- by me.

Magic staff in hand, the Vizier advances menacingly toward the Prince. The Prince scowls. Draws his sword.

Game Play : Farah’s Bedroom
The Vizier attacks the Prince using magic. The Prince defends himself with a sword. The battle ends outside on the balcony.

EXT. EDGE OF JUNGLE --- DAWN

The Vizier staggers, mortally wounded. With a baffled expression on his face, he crumples to his knees.

VIZIER
I could have been... immortal.

And he falls. The Prince stands there, sword in hand, a weary warrior. He turns to see Farah staring in wonderment.

FARAH
Then it's true. He was a traitor.

PRINCE
(extends the dagger)
Take this. Return it to your father's treasure vault. Guard it well.

Farah does not reach for it.

FARAH
(slowly)
I owe you thanks. But why did you invent such a fantastic story? Do you think me a child, that I would believe such nonsense?

Frustrated, the Prince grabs Farah in his arms and gives her a passionate kiss. She struggles against him, finally escapes with a violent shove.

FARAH
(coldly)
I said I owe you thanks. You presume too much.

The Prince looks resigned. Before Farah's eyes, he lifts the dagger... and PRESSES THE REWIND SWITCH.

FAST REWIND, reversing the kiss, and stopping on ---

FARAH
(exact replay)
...such a fantastic story? Do you think me a child, that I would believe such nonsense?

The Prince sighs: he'll never convince her. In his eyes is a new maturity, tinged with gentle regret. He places the dagger into her hands.

PRINCE
You're right. It was just a story.

Farah looks relieved. The Prince turns to head back into the jungle. As he climbs up onto a giant fallen tree –-

FARAH
Wait!
(The Prince turns)
I don't even know your name.

The Prince hesitates. Then inspiration strikes.

PRINCE
Just call me... Kakolookiyam!

With a wink, he jumps down, and vanishes into the jungle.

FARAH

wonders: How could he possibly have known that?

She wrestles with it. Giving up, she turns away... Looks down at the dagger in her hands... Then looks back. A doubt in her eyes.

As she debates, we PULL BACK until Farah is just a small figure standing at the edge of the clearing... Behind her, the safety of the palace; before her, the vast impenetrable darkness of the jungle.

It used to be...we would be...the best of all friends
It turned to be...L-O-V-E, and I was your man, so
You was my, lady-friend, we spent time
I found a way to be by your side
Through the ins and outs, the wrongs and rights
After a while of bein' settled down, I didn't know how
To keep the love, 'cause I was young
I wish I knew then what I know now
I wouldn't let you go, I swear I would've made this love grow
I spent a lot of time and a lot of dough
Tryin' to match what we had and now I-I...

[Chorus]
I was hopin' we could find a way
(Said I was hopin' we could find a way)
To have what we had again today

It was just the two hits I remember nothing more
Only Alex hitting the switch and me hitting the floor
We're taking this lying down
The one thing I can stand up for is resting supine on the ground
Mr. McDermott, won't you help me to my feet
Because the drumline's going wild in the San Francisco streets
The long walk home, is an hour and a half
But it quickly turns to three or four with stops at every underpass
But by June 22nd, I have done the math
That's a hundred and five liters I'll consume of Dr. Path
Some girls will tell their secrets to anyone
The word ""love"" gets thrown around a lot near graduation
So please don't whisper sweet nothings in my ear
When the sound of shredding vocal chords is what I want to hear
Because we're going to San Francisco and I forget to wear some flowers in my hair
She's got a secret surname that nobody knows with the most gorgeous hyphen
You wouldn't believe the way it glows
And I'm the only one who gets to see it way up close
So the rest of you can stick it up your nose

My mother, in a fit of rage, chases me from our home
My mother, the murderer holds me down in the road

Can't die over, must conquer the world first
Like a monster to media on my beautiful girls search
High and low I am no thing you tamper with
Made the plan you should cancel it, make examples I trample shit
Drop your hair I am cancerous, answer this, who can handle this?
Scandalous, I dismantle these ants and piss on a trucer
You think I seen the future, how I wham, quick recouper
Fire hand, wham turn a brand new man, big producer

I used to be afraid, but now I crave the quiet
Together we are both alone, but I don't mind
I'll dream of something to try and make us alright
To make us alright

Baby, put your arms down
They're machines that can't be fixed no more
'Cause when the alarm sounds
I'll be right here waiting at your door
We'll sit up on the bed for a while
Together we are both alone, but we don't mind
We'll dream of something to try and make us alright
To make us alright, it's alright, it's alright
To make us alright, it's alright, it's alright

But the dawn is trouble
When I close my eyes, you never go away
I've tried everything, still you won't change
Is it better if you go?

But the ending doesn't matter
One hundred days and then the suffering stops
Running faster through this
Hope to save your heart before it drops
And you can never say I didn't try
Together we are both alone, but I don't mind
I dreamt of everything, I tried to make us alright

1940,ML1941,Until June,The Saddest Song,sad,"1 ContributorSix Finger Handshake Lyrics[Part 1]

[Verse 1]
I remember
I wanted to tell you, “I love you,” when I told you, “I like you”
You say we would meet up again, up in Athens over the summer
I remember
I wanted to tell you when you sat in the back of that philosophy class
But I couldn’t bring myself to do it
Because those three damn words ended my last three relationships
So now we sit in the botanical gardens
Waiting for the flowers to give me the oxygen
To filter my lungs
And go to my brain
To give me the thoughts
To ration the heart to ask you now

[Chorus 1]
I wanna give you a six finger handshake
Not around your hand, but your body, if that makes sense
I just want to see what we can make
And if we can draw the most out from the less
I wanna be friends
I wanna be more than friends
I wanna be brothers
I wanna be your significant other
Or maybe something more specific than that
I want you to mold me however to your heart’s content
So I can be the clay on top of your pedestal
And you can be my Patrick Swayze
Though I know you don’t get that reference yet
(But soon you will)

I was stuck in a hospital in Valdosta for twelve whole days
I would’ve gotten out of there sooner if my
Doc wasn’t so fixated on drugging me up
Instead of realizing what Asperger’s was
I left there with more problems than I came in with
You called me the day right after I got out
You had so much concern in your voice
Turns out that was just the way you talked
But in that moment you were also expressing concern
My tongue and lips were all swollen
And my body would just constantly stiffen
Turns out, that was just a common reaction
To the medication I blame it on the misdiagnosis, but oh well
Oh well
I remember
I was on the verge of slurring all my words in the Blackbird’s
But you knew to be patient!
And I appreciate you for that
I appreciate you for a lot of other reasons
But that is the one to which I will always return

[Chorus 2]
I wanna give you a six finger handshake
Not around your hand but your bodice! If that makes sense
I wanna give unto you more than I take
Because you’re a person deserving of that kind of love
I wanna show you the world
I wanna show the world you
I wanna give you it all
I wanna give you what’s due
Because your rabbit-like anxiety has haunted you for far too long
You see the universe in amazing detail
Perhaps a little too outstanding for you to handle
But it’s okay because I’ll there to pick you up no matter what
[Bridge 1]
And I know we have issues of our own
But we can work on them
And get better together
Together forever
Forever unsevered
And I know not everything’s set in stone
But we can do that when we’re dead
Because right now we’re fluid
And we don’t care that our bones tell us otherwise
As long as we’re together
I’m certain we’ll make it to the other side
I know that you’re scared
But I’ll be there to protect you every time

[Outro]
I wanna give you a six finger handshake
Well it doesn’t even need to make sense to us anymore
We can dance to communicate and leave all our languages at the door
We can make our own music, kudzu leaves all on the floor
We can build our world, and still have things left to explore

[Part II]

[Verse 3]
I can tell we have different worlds to express
But when we act on them it seems like we just do it to transgress
The way you wanna be makes me think you’re better off as a hermit
But the way that I talk out makes you think that I am looking for a deathwish
I know it's hard to explain your discomfort
In fact I know it’s more irrational to ask for you to do so
Nothing’s wrong with either state
It’s just hard for me to congregate with you
Knowing what you’re looking for
[Pre-Chorus 1]
But in the end
Who are we
But empty cells
Transforming

[Refrain]
I don’t know how it feels
To be scared of drugs
You don’t know how it feels
To be scared of love
We don’t know how it feels
To be either or
So I guess that we will
Wait for it

[Pre-Chorus 2]
In the end
To begin
In the end
We’ll begin

[Verse 4]
I’m sorry I’m so selfish
I’ve just been hellishly embellishing
Everything I’ve been writing down
I just wish I could do the same thing for these chords
So that all my words for you would perfectly align
I’m slowly turning into you
And that would be okay
If we just both didn’t hate ourselves
Cuz now I’m scared that you’ll hate me too
I’m sorry
I’ve just grown so attached
That I’m terrified of the withdrawal
I’ve already been through a week without my medicine
Your love for me is heaven-sent
But I’m scared that I’m bleeding you dry
And this oasis is just a mirage
My intrusive thoughts will form a collage
And now my visions blurry again

[Outro]
But then you say it all will be okay
And that’s enough for me to remain sane

[Part III]

[Intro]
Sorry for breaking down back there hahaha!
Listen, I know I’m not the best at writing stuff that makes other people feel good
But you know more than anyone that practice, practice, practice makes perfect
People keep always telling me that the best songs are always the saddest ones
As if they haven’t heard “Run Away With Me” by Carly Rae Jepsen
Or really anything from her ground-breaking, critically-acclaimed, 2015 album E-MO-TION
I don’t really know where I was going with that to be honest
But, but, but look, the whole point is that
I’m tired of trying to fight my fires with more fire
Especially when it comes with the added bonus of pessimistic elitism in all kinds of art
I’m tired of having to look at my compassion that you gave to me as a weakness
When in fact, it’s the best drug I’ve ever taken
And it’s all thanks to you

[Verse 5]
Woah hey!
Somebody get Will Toledo on the phone
I just want him to pick up and pass the celly to my partner
I just wanna see their face light up like
When they met 100 gecs
Outside that Brockhampton concert
It was somewhat awkward
But we get to relish in the moment right afterwards
We’re living life just as we know it
Woah hey!
Someday I pray to get Wolfgun and Tally Hall
To play our anniversary somehow
But I hope this song will do for now
Because I got a long way to go
Til I’m in the Low Yoyo
Hendershot's, 40 Watt’s, then to Clocked
I wanna be your peanut butter falafel burger with pistachio ice cream on top
Or you know, something just as important
Yeah

[Bridge 2]
I still have that heart-shaped leaf that you found
Last June on the dashboard of my car
It’s dried up a bunch and I still hear the crunch
Everytime that I turn the defroster on
But it’s been there for almost a year now
If that’s not a sign, then I don’t know what
And with formalities out of the way
I just wanna hold you and say

[Chorus 3]
Wïmutu
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you!
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you I love you!
I love you, I love you, I love you!
Oh woah woah
I love you woah oh!
Love you woah oh!
Love you, woah oh oh!
Oh woah, oh, oh oh oh!
I’ll love you until my heart stops beating
But as long as you’re here
My heart will never stop beating for you
My heart will never stop beating for you
Woah oh!
I’ll love you even when we lose all of our form
Cuz you know that our souls will go on to become something more
We’ll extend to become something more
I wanna give you a six finger handshake
So I can show you a flower with steel for a stem
I wanna give you a six finger handshake
Ah, I love you so muchEmbed"

The writing on the wall
A Lazarus in parable

A dark and sullen lullaby
Whispered softly as you die
Promising torments are nigh

Danger warning levels hissed out loud
I saw the silver lining hidden in a mushroom cloud
Now I'm reeling from the shock at ground zero

If yesterday you would have stood up proud
Then why tonight have you thrown in with the stoning crowd?
I'll breathe through the foetus of a new day kicking

The foetus of a new day kicking

It's true that Jesus cannot save
I'm rising from the grave
To put my double cross to shame

A poison rush, a heart attack
A white assassin painted black

In this garden of Gethsemane
You played the traitor well

In a dawn to come
I will blind the sun

To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?

[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

[Chorus]
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product

Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
