React automatic and we burst when squeezed And make 9/11 each emergency Urgency, amber to red, like the turnin' leaves Oh, please let the hurtin' cease And don't let apathy police the populace We will march across Those stereotypes that were marked for us The answer's obvious, we switch the consonants And change the sword to words and lift continents    Rise together, we rise together We rise together, we rise together We rise together, we rise together We rise together, we rise together       Rise together, we rise together We rise together, we rise together We rise together, we rise together We rise together, we rise together    If you believe in redemption I'm callin' to you from another dimension If you believe in redemption I'm callin' to you from another dimension If you believe in redemption I'm callin' to you from another dimension If you believe in redemption I'm callin' to you from another dimension \",\n          \"   Somniferous whisperings of scarlet fields Sleep calling me and my dreams are wondrous My reality is abandoned I traverse afar Not a care if I never wake  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"mood_cats\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 3,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0,\n          3\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":20}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df['lyrics'] = df['lyrics'].str.replace('[vV]erse [1-9]*', ' ', regex=True)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"542_cgplW6t7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710032630570,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":314,"user":{"displayName":"Joshua Lee","userId":"12766360895124423633"}},"outputId":"a49e48ef-6ecb-40ca-e5a7-4bd2ef770264"},"execution_count":21,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["<ipython-input-21-f0d3b573907c>:1: SettingWithCopyWarning: \n","A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.\n","Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead\n","\n","See the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n","  df['lyrics'] = df['lyrics'].str.replace('[vV]erse [1-9]*', ' ', regex=True)\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df[df['lyrics'].str.match('.*Verse.*', case=False)]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":424},"id":"FMkDj6lPaP2R","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710032631111,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":543,"user":{"displayName":"Joshua Lee","userId":"12766360895124423633"}},"outputId":"97cb4b7d-71c5-4eff-afdc-77465dc36362"},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                         lyrics_filename  \\\n","216                     A_Perfect_Circle___Judith_edited   \n","228       Jay_Munly___Big_Black_Bull_Comes_Like_A_Caesar   \n","530            Cephalic_Carnage___GLobal_OVerhaul_DEvice   \n","604                         Junior_Boys___Parallel_Lines   \n","612    And_You_Will_Know_Us_By_The_Trail_Of_Dead___Ho...   \n","...                                                  ...   \n","13459         Hot_Hot_Heat___Bandages_Rhapsody_Originals   \n","13615                                 Japan___Television   \n","14204      Aretha_Franklin___Never_Let_Me_Go__LP_Version   \n","14314         Immortal_Technique___Creation__Destruction   \n","14395                          Arcadia___All_Out_Of_Love   \n","\n","                                                  lyrics  mood_cats  \n","216     Let us look at those Scriptures which provide...          3  \n","228     As we there are where are we are we there fro...          1  \n","530     My life was too absurd, the way that I tainte...          3  \n","604     If you found the words, would you really say ...          1  \n","612     Looking back in time Through verses set in nu...          3  \n","...                                                  ...        ...  \n","13459   THE TASK.

Now follow we out by Starloe! \",\n          \" Let us look at those Scriptures which provide a corrective to unwritten tradition a standard or \\u201ccanon\\u201d by which it may be tested. In other words, we must consider the relation between our general subject of Christian tradition and the \\u201ccanon\\u201d of Scripture. When we speak of the \\u201ccanon\\u201d of Scripture we use the word in a different sense from that of \\u201crule\\u201d or \\u201cstandard\\u201d; the \\u201ccanon\\u201d of Scripture is originally the \\u201clist\\u201d of books recognized by the church as her sacred writings, a use of the word first attested, it appears, in Athanasius.1\\\\xa0But inevitably, because of the close relation between Scripture and the rule of faith, something of the sense of authority has come to be attached in common usage to the terms \\u201ccanon\\u201d and \\u201ccanonical\\u201d when they refer to the books of the Bible. This is an area in which the most biblicist and anti-traditionalist Christian communities rely perforce upon tradition, a tradition which in fact is more essential the more biblicist a community it is. For the more essential the more biblicist a community is, the more dependent it is for its authority on sola scriptura, and the more necessary it is to define\\\\xa0sola scriptura. In other words, the more Christians aim at being \\u201cpeople of one book,\\u201d the more important it is for them to know the limits of that one book. \\\\xa0Delimiting The Canon  There are some churches in which the limits of the canon are laid down by authority; their members formally, at any rate accept these limits because their church has defined them. This is true, for instance, of the Roman Catholic Church, the Church of England, and those churches which adhere to the Westminster Confession of Faith. But what of churches which do not have the canon of Scripture delimited for them in this way? I write now of my own heritage. On what authority say do we accept the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, as commonly reckoned, either rejecting the Apocrypha altogether or else relegating them to an inferior or \\u201cdeuterocanonical\\u201d status? \\u201cWe accept these thirty-nine books,\\u201d it may be said, \\u201cbecause they make up the Hebrew Bible which our Lord and the apostles acknowledged.\\u201d True there seems to have been common ground between our Lord and the Jewish scribes of His day on the content of Scripture, however much they differed on its interpretation and application. We may be sure that He and they accepted the threefold corpus of Law, Prophets, and Writings as it was known from the second century B.C. if not earlier.2\\\\xa0But, in view of the fact that the precise limits of the third group, the \\u201cWritings,\\u201d do not appear to have been fixed by Jewish authority until the last quarter of the first century A.D., can we be quite sure that our Lord accepted say Ecclesiastes or Esther? lf, as the argument from silence might suggest, Esther was unknown as a canonical book to the Qumran community; would it be surprising to discover that it was similarly unknown in our Lord\\u2019s circle? Yet we accept Ecclesiastes and Esther as part of Holy Scripture. Why? Not, in our case, because ecclesiastical authority so directs us stubborn individualists as many of us are. If ecclesiastical authority did so direct us, that in itself might stimulate us to refuse the direction. No, we accept them, l suppose, because we have \\u201creceived\\u201d them as included in Holy Writ, in other words, because of our tradition. Our tradition is not inviolably sacrosanct, but unless strong reason is shown for rejecting something that we so receive, like the canonicity of these books, we go along with it.  Take an example of another kind: the Book of Enoch.4 We do not accept this book as canonical. It is not so accepted either by western Catholicism the rock from which we were hewn or by eastern Orthodoxy, although it is part of the Bible of the Monophysite Ethiopic church. Yet it is quoted, and quoted as authoritative, by a New Testament writer5. We cannot dismiss Jude\\u2019s Enoch quotation as on a level with Paul\\u2019s quotations from Menander6\\\\xa0or Epimenides7; Jude quotes from the Book of Enoch as other New Testament writers quote the Hebrew prophets, treating the words as a divine oracles8. No doubt it would put too great a strain on our intellectual agility to defend the divine inspiration of the whole Book of Enoch, even if other parts of it have influenced thought and language elsewhere in the New Testament.9\\\\xa0But it is not because of the difficulty of defending the inspiration of the Book of Enoch that we do not accept it; it is primarily because our tradition does not recognize it: we have not \\\"received\\\" it. Certainly, if valid arguments were forthcoming for the acceptance of this book, we might revise our tradition and accept it; otherwise, we go along with our tradition. However, Jude\\u2019s quotation of a passage from the Book of Enoch as a divine oracle might prompt the query whether the Letter of Jude itself should be accepted as canonical. It was one the \\u201cdisputed\\u201d books in the early church,10 and Luther put it among the four New Testament books to which he accorded a lower canonical status than the other twenty-three.11\\\\xa0But this raises the problem of the New Testament canon, a knottier problem than that of the Old Testament canon. Apart from such questions as might be raised about \\u201cmarginal\\u201d books like Eccesiastes and Esther, the Christian biblicist can properly say that he accepts the Old Testament not on the authority of ecclesiastical tradition but on that of our Lord and the apostles. He has no such short answer to the question of the New Testament canon. These, then, are some of the questions which arise when this subject is under consideration.   The Old Testament Canon The earliest Christians, as we have seen, found their sacred writings ready at hand in the books of the Hebrew Bible, either in their original text or in the Greek version. The acceptance of the Old Testament was indubitably something which they \\u201creceived from the Lord\\u201d by example as well as by instruction. For, to reproduce a purple passage from a distinguished Old Testament scholar of a past generation: \\\"For us its supreme sanction is that which it received from Christ Himself. It was the Bible of His education and the Bible of His ministry. He took for granted its fundamental doctrines about creation, about man and about righteousness; about God\\u2019s Providence of the world and His purposes of grace through Israel. He accepted its history as the preparation for Himself, and taught His disciples to find Him in it. He used it to justify His mission and to illuminate the mystery of His Cross. He drew from it many of the examples and most of the categories of His gospel. He reinforced the essence of its law and restored many of its ideals. But, above all, He fed His own soul with its contents, and the great crises of His life sustained Himself upon it as upon the living and sovereign Word of God. These are the highest external proofs -- if indeed we can call them external-- for the abiding validity of the Old Testament in the life and doctrine of Christ\\u2019s Church. What was indispensable to the Redeemer must always be indispensable to the redeemed.12\\\"  In the apostolic age there is no sign that Christians felt the need of a New Testament in the sense of a collection of writings. They had the sacred writings which their Lord used and fulfilled, writings which not only conveyed the way of \\u201csalvation through faith in Christ Jesus\\u201d but which also, being divinely inspired, were \\u201cprofitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.13\\u201d These writings, until well into the second century, constituted the church\\u2019s Bible, read, of course, through Christian spectacles. From them the apostles of the first century and the apologists of the second century drew their basic texts as they proclaimed and defended the gospel; the reading of them was sufficient to convince a number of educated pagans of the truth of Christianity.14 One thing which does not seem to have greatly concerned those early Christians was the precise delimitation of their Bible. Actually, there was no particular reason why they should be greatly concerned; they were all agreed about its main contents. It is commonly supposed that the threefold division of the Hebrew Bible corresponds to three stages in the growth of the Hebrew canon.15\\\\xa0The Law and the Prophets were firmly established as well-defined bodies of canonical literature long before the Christian era, and so were most of the \\u201cWritings.\\u201d The grandson of Jesus ben Sira tells how his grandfather, at the beginning of the second century B.C., was a student of \\u201cthe law and the prophets and the other books of our fathers.16\\u201d Our Lord apparently knew His Bible as beginning with Genesis and ending with Chronicles,17\\\\xa0as the Hebrew Bible traditionally does and He is recorded as speaking of \\u201ceverything that is written in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms.\\u201d Since the Psalter is the first book of the \\u201cWritings,\\u201d it has sometimes been thought that \\u201cthe psalms\\u201d here might indicate the whole group of documents which it introduces, but this is uncertain. This third group was not authoritatively \\u201cclosed\\u201d until after the catastrophe of A.D. 70, when the rabbis of Jamnia, Yochanan ben Zakkai and his colleagues, undertook the reconstitution of the Jewish polity on a religious basis. But although the \\u201cWritings\\\" had remained open until then, so that they could freely discuss the admission of fresh documents or the eviction of others, their final decision seems to have been the confirmation of traditional practice.18\\\\xa0Josephus, writing towards the end of the first century, treats the whole canon of Hebrew scripture as closed and reckons its contents to be twenty-two books in all a total designed to coincide with the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet.19  Christians, however, and particularly Gentile Christians, would not feel bound by the decrees of Jamnia. The rank and file who used the Greek version might include among their sacred books works which were closely associated with those of whose canonicity there was no doubt, although the better informed made a distinction in theory, at least, between those which were part of the Hebrew Bible and those which were not. Here and there in the New Testament we find introduced by a formula which normally indicates a Scripture quotation something which cannot be identified in any Old Testament text known to us or, for the matter of that, in any other text known to us.20\\\\xa0Jude not only quotes from the Book of Enoch,21\\\\xa0but also alludes to an incident which was probably recorded in the Assumption of Moses.22\\\\xa0It is striking, however, that from \\u201cthe Books commonly called Apocrypha\\u201d no quotation appears to be made by any New Testament writer.23  The earliest Christian list of Old Testament books, compiled about A.D. 170\\\\xa0by Melito, bishop of Sardis, was based on information which he received while travelling in Syria;24\\\\xa0it comprises all the books of the Hebrew Bible except Esther.25\\\\xa0Just a little later is a list preserved in a manuscript in the Library of the Greek Patriarchate in Jerusalem in which the title of each book is given both in Hebrew or Aramaic and in Greek.26\\\\xa0Origen C. A.D. 230 also gives us a list of Old Testament books with their Hebrew and Greek titles; the Book of the Twelve Prophets is accidentally omitted from the textual tradition of his list but is required to make up his total. \\u201cOutside these,\\u201d he adds, \\u201care the books of Maccabees.\\u201d27\\\\xa0Athanasius A.D.  communicated to his fellow bishops a list of canonical books, including all the books of the Hebrew Bible except Esther; Esther he includes, along with Wisdom, Ben Sira, Judith, and Tobit, among those \\u201cother \\u2018books outside our list which are not canonical, but have been handed down from our fathers as suitable to be read to new converts.\\\"28  As late as the second half of the fourth century, then, there survived in the church a strong tradition putting the books contained in the Hebrew Bible on a higher level than those not contained in it, although doubts persisted regarding the status of Esther.  The question of the Old Testament canon is discussed by Jerome in the prologues to his Latin translation of the books of Samuel or, as he called them, I and II Kings, of the Solomonic books and of Daniel. Jerome\\u2019s acquaintance with Hebrew was far in advance of that of any other father of the western church --far in advance, one might say, of that of any other church father in west or east after the time of Origin -- and he attached high importance to the \\u201cHebraic verity,\\u201d as he put it. It was he who first used the adjective \\u201capocryphal\\u201d of the books outside the Hebrew canon,29\\\\xa0indicating not that they were in any sense spurious but that although the church \\u201cdoes not receive them within the canonical scriptures,\\u201d yet she \\u201creads them for the edification of the people, not to confirm the authority of ecclesiastical dogmas.\\u201d30  But Jerome\\u2019s careful distinction tended to be forgotten by others who had no direct access, as he had, to the Hebrew Bible and who had received the books which he called the Apocrypha together with those which belonged to the Hebrew canon. Augustine, for example, reckons the Old Testament books as forty-four in number including Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, I and II Maccabees,31\\\\xa0and the same view was accepted in his time by the Synod of Hippo 393 and the Third Synod of Carthage 397.  But the law was not laid down dogmatically about the limits of the Old Testament canon: they remained a matter of tradition until the sixteenth century.32\\\\xa0It was in the Reformation period that a serious issue was made of them. While the Anglicans and Lutherans generally followed the precedent of Jerome,33\\\\xa0treating the apocryphal books as unsuitable for the establishment of doctrine, the Council of Trent 1546 ignored his precedent and declared that all the books in the Vulgate were canonical without distinction, and at the opposite extreme the Reformers who followed the pattern of Geneva ultimately took the line that \\u201cthe Books commonly called Apocrypha, not being of divine inspiration, are not part of the canon of the Scripture and therefore are of no authority in the church of God, nor to be any otherwise approved, or made use of, than other human writings.\\u201d35  The position taken up at Trent was reaffirmed at Vatican Council I 1869-70,36 but in practice the distinction made by Jerome is observed today by many Roman Catholic scholars, who find it convenient to use the old classification of biblical books into \\u201cprotocanonical\\u201d and \\u201cdeuterocanonical.\\u201d37\\\\xa0But positions taken up in an atmosphere of controversy tend to be maintained as party traditions: there are, for example, some people even today who, not being well versed in the history or status of the apocryphal books, think of them as in some sense the perquisite of Rome. Thus a reviewer of the New English Bible, criticizing it for including these books, remarked: \\u201cRome can rightly rejoice that at last her view of the canon of Scripture has displaced that of the Apostolic Church\\u201d38\\\\xa0as though all the major Protestant versions of the complete Bible, from Coverdale to the Revised Standard Version, had not included the Apocrypha as a matter of course. The New Testament Canon  While the Old Testament constituted the church\\u2019s earliest Bible, it was the Old Testament read and applied in the light of the gospel. The gospel God\\u2019s final and perfect word to men was supremely authoritative, since it was embodied in Christ Himself, the church\\u2019s Lord. But for a generation and more there was no need to appeal to a written record of the gospel even if from an early date there were notes or digests of the ministry or teaching of Jesus, compiled for the use of preachers or teachers, no particular authority attached to such notes or digests. The authority belonged to the message which they documented, and ultimately to the Lord whom the message proclaimed. His authority could not be rated below that of the prophets who foretold His coming: Clement of Rome, for instance, quotes \\u201cthe words of the Lord Jesus\\u201d on the same level as the Spirit\\u2019s utterances through Jeremiah and Hannah.\\u201d39  The authority of the Lord was exercised by His specially commissioned apostles,40\\\\xa0as may be seen both in those whose base was Jerusalem and in Paul as he pursued his Gentile mission and directed his Gentile churches. The Jerusalem decree of Acts l5:29 is an early example of the authority wielded by the Jerusalem apostles, and a careful reading of Paul\\u2019s letters indicates that they or, if not themselves in person, then others in their name tried to extend their authority over his mission field.41\\\\xa0Paul, for his part, teaches his converts to recognize in his writings \\u201ca command of the Lord\\u201d I Cor.\\\\xa014:37 and indicates that he lays down one \\u201crule in all the churches\\u201d I Cor.\\\\xa07:17; cf.\\\\xa011:16;\\\\xa014:33b. But in writing to a church outside the area of his own apostolic responsibility, he shows the restraint and delicacy that he would have liked his fellow apostles to exhibit in their approach to his churches.42  After the apostolic age, however, the recognition of separate spheres of apostolic service disappeared. While in the second century we find Marcion, on the one hand, venerating Paul as the only faithful apostle of Jesus,43\\\\xa0and the Ebionites, on the other hand, execrating the memory of Paul and exalting the names of Peter and especially James the Just,44\\\\xa0the church as a whole carried out in practice Paul\\u2019s own exhortation to recognize that all the apostles and teachers \\u201cwhether Paul or Apollos or Cephas\\u201d belonged to them all I Cor.\\\\xa03:22. However unhistorical we may judge the claim of the churches of Rome and Corinth to be joint-foundations of Peter and Paul,45\\\\xa0the attitude expressed in such a claim was a sound one. And this attitude finds expression in the New Testament canon, where every document that could colourably be called apostolic found its place in due course.  The gospels, anonymous though they were, were recognized as transcripts of the apostolic witness to Christ and, from an early point in the second century, were brought together, so that they no longer circulated separately in their respective constituencies but as a fourfold collection. It is difficult to say how far advanced this process was in the time of Ignatius, but he clearly had a written gospel to appeal to, and equally clearly he had to contend with more conservative brethren who disapproved of the idea of appealing to any written authority alongside the Old Testament scriptures as interpreted in the church\\u2019s oral tradition. This is the point of the reference in his Letter to the Philadelphians, to those people who asserted \\u201clf l do not find it in the archives  , l do not believe it   in the gospel.\\u201d To which he replied \\u201clt is written\\u201d \\u201cScripture says\\u201d meaning that the gospel is \\u201cscripture\\u201d. But they say, \\u201cThat is the very point at question\\u201d i.e., is the gospel\\u201cscripture\\u201d? And then Ignatius, like many another debater driven into a corner, takes refuge in rhetoric.  \\\"But my archives are Jesus Christ; the inviolable archives are His cross, His death, His resurrection, and the faith which is exercised through Him. . . .46\\\"  Plainly lgnatius regarded Jesus Christ as his \\u201ctradition.\\u201d Within that tradition everything had a place which bore true witness to Him: the Old Testament scriptures because they pointed forward to Him, the written gospel because it was the record of His incarnation and passion, the letters of the apostles because they were His delegates, and the church\\u2019s faith and worship because they had their source in Him. Plainly, too, Ignatius had not thought his tradition through to first principles, so that he could give a logical defense of it in every part, including his recognition of the gospel as \\u201cscripture.\\u201d The earliest recognition of the New Testament writings was spontaneous and instinctive; the rationale of the canon came later. Hence the history of the canon at its outset has untidy edges; we cannot give a cut and dried account of its first formation any more than lgnatius or his contemporaries could have done.  The necessity of a canon of written documents as a check on the corruption of oral tradition was as apparent to many Gnostics as it was to those who maintained the tradition of the apostolic churches. Valentinus, according to Tertullian, used the whole New Testament canon,47\\\\xa0and the substantial truth of this statement has been confirmed in recent years by the evidence of Valentinian documents found among the Nag Hammadi papyri. The Gospel of Truth, for example, acknowledges the authority of every major section of the New Testament except the Pastoral Epistles.48\\\\xa0It was in their interpretation of the documents, not in their recognition of them, that the Valentinians were distinguished from the catholic church.49  Marcion, for his part, also knew the value of an authoritative written canon and, strong in his cast-iron presuppositions, he promulgated his edition of the Euangelion and Apostolikon as in his view they must originally have been, thus creating a new tradition for his followers. The catholic leaders had an older tradition, but no doubt it was the promulgation of Marcion\\u2019s canon that stimulated them, and especially the leaders of the Roman church, to define that tradition more precisely than they had thus far felt necessary. Whereas Marcion\\u2019s canon expressed his exclusive devotion to Paul Luke the evangelist enjoying special credit because of his association with Paul,50\\\\xa0the catholic canon was catholic in a further sense, comprising the writings of other apostles or \\u201capostolic men\\u201d alongside Paul, and of three other evangelists alongside Luke, and binding the Euangelion and Apostolikon together with Luke\\u2019s second volume, henceforth called the Acts of the Apostles, which provided the sequel to the gospel story and the historical context of the apostolic letters, presenting independent evidence for the genuineness of Paul\\u2019s apostolic claims51\\\\xa0and for the loyal witness of other apostles whom Marcion had denigrated. Acts was thus, as Harnack aptly put it, the \\u201cpivot\\u201d of the New Testament.52 Justin Martyr attests the use of an informal New Testament canon; he tells how \\u201cthe memoirs of the apostles,\\u201d otherwise called \\u201cgospels,\\u201d were read in church in the same way as \\u201cthe compositions of the prophets\\u201d53\\\\xa0and quotes Old Testament texts together with passages from the writings of the new covenant especially sayings of Jesus as though they shared the same authority.54\\\\xa0If here and there his works contain traces of materials from the pseudonymous Gospels of Peter or Thomas, these are very few in comparison with his use of the fourfold Gospel.  Justin\\u2019s disciple Tatian is best known for his Diatessaron or Harmony of the four Gospels, which provides sufficient evidence of the separate level on which these four records were placed in his time. In places Tatian appears to have amplified the fourfold record by means of the Gospel according to the Hebrews, which may have been a sectarian revision of Matthew but not to an extent which impairs the fourfold pattern of his Harmony.55  For Irenaeus, the fourfold Gospel is one of the facts of life, as axiomatic as the four pillars of the earth or the four winds of \\\\xa0heaven.56\\\\xa0This shows how thoroughly he and his contemporaries took it for granted that there were, and could be, only four gospel writings. Even more thoroughly did they take it for granted that these four could only be Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John: this is something which, for them, did not even need to be proved. By the time of Irenaeus, too, the main contents of the catholic canon were fixed and accepted throughout the Christian world. He does not give us a formal list, but it is plain that for him the fourfold Gospel, Acts, the Pauline corpus, I Peter, I John, and Revelation were \\u201cscripture\\u201d as also were I Clement and The Shepherd of Hermas.57  The earliest catholic list of New Testament books that has been preserved to us is that in the \\u201cMuratorian\\u201d canon, which probably represents the tradition of the Roman church at the end of the second century.58\\\\xa0The one surprise in this list is the omission of l Peter this omission, in view of the corrupt state of the text in the only extant copy of the list, could conceivably be accidental.59\\\\xa0As it is, the list contains the four Gospels, Acts, the letters of Paul, Jude and John,60\\u201cJohn\\u2019s Apocalypse and Peter\\u2018s,61\\u201d with the Wisdom of Solomon.62\\\\xa0The Shepherd of Hermas, edifying as it is, is too recent to be reckoned canonical.63 The writings of the Valentinians, Marcionites, and Montanists are to be rejected. As interesting as the contents of the list is the kind of argument put forward for the canonical acceptance of the various books. Luke was Paul\\u2019s \\u201clegal expert,\\u201d an official who issued decrees and similar documents in accordance with his superior\\u2019s judgement;64\\\\xa0thus Luke\\u2019s writings are made to share Paul\\u2019s authority. Luke\\u2019s second volume is inappropriately called \\u201cthe Acts of all the apostles\\u201d possibly by way of anti-Marcionite emphasis but possibly also to make it clear that this was the only genuine book of apostolic Acts. In recent decades the five volumes of \\u201cLeucian\\u201d Acts had appeared-- of Peter, John, Andrew, Thomas, and Paul65-- and the compiler of our list wishes it to be understood that it is to the canonical Acts, and not to these apocryphal works, that one must go in order to find an authentic record of the apostles\\u2019 journeyings. Should anyone ask why Luke breaks off his narrative without tracing Paul\\u2019s career to its end, the answer is that he narrated only those things which took place in his presence.66\\\\xa0This same insistence on eyewitness testimony --a further token of the author\\u2019s acquaintance with Roman law --appears in his treatment of the Gospel of John, in which, he maintains, the Evangelist recorded only \\u201cwhat we have seen with our eyes and heard with our ears and our hands have handled\\u201d quoting I John l:l.  When he comes to deal with the canonicity of Paul\\u2019s letters, he makes the quite astonishing statement that Paul wrote letters to seven churches in accordance with the pattern set by John, who did the same in the Apocalypse. Presumably the canonicity of John\\u2019s seven letters depended on his being a prophet, and the authority of Paul\\u2019s letters was established by analogy with John\\u2019s. 67\\\\xa0The same implication that prophecy is the main criterion of canonicity appears in his remark about The Shepherd of Hermas. This obviously could not be accepted as an apostolic writing, but its character would have qualified it for inclusion among the prophets, had the prophetic list not been closed long since.  The principal criterion of New Testament canonicity imposed in the early church was not prophetic inspiration but apostolic authorship or, if not authorship, then authority. In an environment where apostolic tradition counted for so much, the source and norm of that tradition were naturally found in the writings of apostles or of men closely associated with apostles. Mark and Luke, for instance, were known not to be apostles, but their close association with Peter and Paul6 8respectively was emphasized. As for the epistles, however, the tendency was for canonicity to be tied to the ascription of apostolic authorship. The Letter to the Hebrews, for example, was known in the Roman church earlier than anywhere else69\\\\xa0so far as our evidence goes, but Rome was one of the last important churches to acknowledge it as canonical, just as Rome was one of the last important churches to ascribe Pauline authorship to it not out of conviction, but out of an unwillingness to be out of step in this regard with Alexandria and the other great eastern churches.  This unwillingness to be out of step with other churches reminds us that another criterion of canonicity was catholicity. A document which was acknowledged only in one small corner of Christendom was unlikely to win acceptance as canonical one which was acknowledged over the greater area of Christendom was likely to win still wider acceptance.  Throughout the third and fourth centuries the definition of the New Testament canon continued to become more and more precise until in\\\\xa0367 Athanasius70\\\\xa0followed by the Synod of Hippo in\\\\xa0393\\\\xa0and the Third Synod of Carthage in\\\\xa0397 listed as canonical the twenty-seven books which have been handed down to us. Until then it was customary to distinguish the universally acknowledged books and the disputed books, the spurious books those laying false claim to apostolic authorship, and the heretical books which were erroneous and utterly to be repudiated. If a disputed book taught apostolic doctrine and was sufficiently ancient, it tended to be given the benefit of the doubt. The authorship of Jude, for example, was uncertain but, as Origen said, it was \\u201cfull of words of heavenly grace\\u201d72\\\\xa0and so it ultimately gained admission. The Shepherd of Hermas, on the other hand, popular as it was and recommended for reading in church, was known to be of post-apostolic origin and was so ruled out on the score of insufficient antiquity.73  But, as has already been said, these criteria of canonicity were largely devised to justify a tradition which already existed. Authority precedes canonicity that is to say, the various writings do not derive their authority from their inclusion in the canon, they were included in the canon because their authenticity was recognized.74\\\\xa0It is going too far to say, as Oscar Cullmann does, that \\u201camong the early Christian writings the books which were to form the future canon forced themselves on tho Church by their intrinsic apostolic authority, as they do still, because the Kyrios Christ speaks in them\\u201d75\\\\xa0- at least, if this is to be taken as a statement of history. \\u201cIntrinsic apostolic authority\\u201d is a difficult entity to define. With our longer perspective we can say that the early church, in recognizing the books which make up the New Testament canon as uniquely worthy to stand alongside the sacred scriptures of the old covenant, was guided by a wisdom higher than its own. When we think of other early Christian documents more or less contemporary with the latest books of the New Testament --the Epistle of Clement of Rome, the Epistle of Barnabas, The Shepherd of Hermas, the Letters of lgnatius, and the Didache for example --we may be thankful that they did not succeed in gaining admission to the canon, although some of them were on the fringe of it for a considerable time. The question has been raised whether it is legitimate for us to defend the early church\\u2019s decision about admission and exclusion with arguments quite different from those which were used at the time.76\\\\xa0But we have no option if we accept the canon we must defend our acceptance of it with arguments which we hold to be valid. The Reformation And After At the time of the Reformation, the canon of Scripture, like everything else that was handed down by tradition, was subjected to scrutiny. In many of the traditions handed down through medieval times, the Reformers recognized a close kinship to that \\u201ctradition of men\\u201d with which our Lord found fault because it displaced \\u201cthe commandment of God.\\u201d77\\\\xa0The danger of this tendency, said Calvin, lies in the fact that \\u201cwhenever holiness is made to consist in anything else than in observing the law of God, men are led to believe that the law may be violated without danger.\\u201d Then he adds \\u201cLet any man now consider whether this wickedness does not at present abound more among the Papists than it formerly did among the Jews.\\u201d78\\\\xa0And in many other places where the Gospels said \\u201cPharisees\\u201d the Reformers read \\u201cPapists.\\u201d Yet church tradition was not jettisoned completely by the mainstream Reformers; in doctrine and practice alike they went back beyond the Middle Ages to appeal to the fathers of the early centuries. Calvin himself was no mean patristic scholar and adduces patristic evidence freely and copiously in support of his arguments. But the fathers themselves were subject to the superior authority of Scripture. Calvin himself does not discuss the canon of the Scripture as distinct from its authority which he defends alike against those who in practice made it subordinate to church tradition and those who rejected it in favor of their private revelations.79\\\\xa0\\u201cThose who are inwardly taught by the Holy Spirit acquiesce implicitly in Scripture. . . . Scripture, carrying its own evidence along with it, deigns not to submit to proofs and arguments, but owes the full conviction with which we ought to receive it to the testimony of the Spirit.\\u201d80\\\\xa0He does not explicitly make the inward testimony of the Spirit a criterion of canonicity, but if the question had been directly put to him how he knew say that the Hebrew and Aramaic text of Daniel was Scripture whereas the additions in the Greek version were not, he might well have done so. The apostolicity of I I Peter is for him secondary,81\\\\xa0but \\\"it contains nothing unworthy of Peter, and.. . . shows throughout the power and grace of the apostolic spirit. . . . Certainly since the majesty of the Spirit of Christ expresses itself in all parts of the epistle, l have a dread of repudiating it, even though I do not recognize in it the genuine language of Peter.\\u201d82\\\\xa0This is in effect, an appeal \\u201d to the testimony of the Spirit for decision regarding a \\\"disputed\\\" book.83  Luther expressed himself more freely, if less systematically.He translated the apocryphal books along with the Hebrew Bible, but gave them the same inferior rank as Jerome did. The same inferior rank, indeed, was given with emphasis to one of the books of the Hebrew Bible \\u201cI hate Esther and II Maccabees so much \\u201d he said,\\u201c that I wish they did not exist. There is too much Judaism in them and much heathen vice.\\u201d84\\\\xa0But within the New Testament also he assigned a lower rank to some books than to others. As is well known, in the list of books prefaced to his German New Testament he attaches serial numbers to the first \\\"twenty-three, which he calls elsewhere \\u201cthe right certain capital books,\\u201d85\\\\xa0and separates off the remaining four Hebrews, James Jude, and Revelation by a space and by the absence of serial numbers, In his prefaces to these books he indicates his reasons for relegating them to what was in essence deuterocanonical status. Hebrews, he reckoned, contained some \\\"wood, straw and hay\\u201d along with the \\u201cgold, silver and precious stones\\\" which were built into its fabric, and so it could not be placed on a level with the apostolic epistles.\\u201d86James contradicted the doctrine of Justification by faith, and although it pressed home the \\u2018law of God, it bore no evangelical witness to Christ.87\\\\xa0Jude, which he mistakenly, no doubt regarded as an abstract of ll Peter, was \\\"an unnecessary epistle to include among the capital books which ought to lay the foundation of faith\\u201d; it was also held against it that it included uncanonical teaching and history a reference to the Enoch quotation and the dispute about the body of Moses.88\\\\xa0Revelation \\u201clacks everything that I hold as apostolic or prophetic\\u201d89although the sharpness of this judgement, expressed in 1522, was subsequently mitigated.  To a large degree Luther\\u2019s deuterocanonical books coincide with those which the early church ranked as disputed, but it was not the verdict of the early church that weighed with Luther so much as evangelical content. Therefore he had no difficulty about ll Peter or ll and lll John, although their apostolicity was questioned in the early church. The criterion of canonicity at least for protocanonicity, for inclusion among the \\\"capital books\\\"was for Luther \\u201cwhat presses home Christ\\\" was Christum treibet90\\\\xa0Not the identity of the writer, but the character of the writing, is what counts. \\u201cThat which does not teach Christ is not apostolic, even if Peter or Paul taught it. Again, that which does preach Christ is apostolic even if Judas, Annas, Pilate or Herod did it.\\\"91\\\\xa0In this Luther shows himself a true disciple of Paul: \\u201ceven if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to You a gospel contrary to that which we preached to you, let him be accursed\\u201d Gal\\\\xa01:8  Luther\\\\'s criterion is still widely accepted. When Dr.Norman Snaith delivered his Fernley Hartley Lecture on the Distinctive Ideas of the Old Testament, he found that the distinctive ideas were those which were taken up and brought to perfection in the New Testament, not least in the letters of Paul, while \\\"the true development from Pauline theology is to be found in Luther and in John Wesley.92\\\\xa0Some readers might find it a surprising coincidence that the finest flowering of the biblical revelation should be discerned in the tradition of which Dr. Snaith is himself such a worthy and devoted exponent; but l have no doubt he is right --although too may not be entirely unbiased in this regard.  Quite similar is the argument of the late Edward J. Carnell that, since Justification by faith is systematically expounded only in Romans and Galatians, \\u201ctherefore, if the church teaches anything that offends the system of Romans and Galatians, it is cultic\\\"93\\\\xa0\\u201ccultic\\u201d apparently having the sense of \\u201csectarian\\u201d as opposed to \\u201ccatholic\\u201d. Again \\u201cwhenever a passage conflicts with teaching of Romans and Galatians, either the mind has failed to grasp its meaning, or the passage falls under the concept of progressive revelation.94 The Canon In The Twentieth Century  But we have received the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, and while individual readers or teachers may make distinctions between those among them which are \\u201ccapital\\u201d and those which are of lower grade, our church tradition has made no distinction since the end of the fourth century. The statement of Article Vl, that these twenty-seven are books of whose authority was never any doubt in the Church,\\u201d is not true it we press our quest back earlier than that date, but from the on it represents the general consensus, if we overlook some of the separated eastern churches. lf, however, we are asked today why we accept these twenty-seven, or why we accept any specific one of them, do we give our tradition as a sufficient answer or do we seek an answer more satisfactory to ourselves and to our questioners?  Some of us, theological students and the like, have studied the formation of the canon and can give a historical reason of sorts for our position. But what is the ordinary church member to say, especially if his church\\u2019s formularies make no explicit statement about the canon? A Roman Catholic layman will appeal to the authority of the church, which has made clear pronouncements on this subject, but what does the ordinary free churchman say? Hardly, I suppose, \\u201cBecause the church say so\\u201d the only church he knows may be the local church to which he belongs, and it is unlikely ever to have made a pronouncement on the canon. Will he say, \\u201cBecause my pastor says so, and he is a man of such piety and learning in fact, he is a B.A. Theol. of Manchester that he cannot be wrong\\u201d? Perhaps; but what if his pastor voices doubts about the canonicity of Jude or the apostolicity of II Peter? He is then quite likely to say, \\\"My pastor, I fear, is a little unsound; he does not believe the whole Bible and that is the result of his attending those classes in Biblical Criticism at Manchester University.\\u201d But how does he know what \\u201cthe whole Bible\\u201d is? Most probably by tradition sound and reliable tradition, no doubt, but tradition nonetheless.  l turn now to a body of nineteenth-century origin unsurpassed in its professed adherence to sola scriptura and repudiation of the authority of tradition --the Exclusive Brethren-- and cite no unlearned church member but their ablest scholar, William Kelly. William Kelly was no mean theologian, but he would have been the last man to acknowledge any debt to \\\"mere\\\" tradition.95\\\\xa0Yet he \\u201cwas the staunchest upholder of the entire Nicene and Athanasian doctrine,\\u201d96\\\\xa0and to him the New Testament canon was a datum. ln his commentary on the Epistles of Peter, for example he notes the doubts that some had expressed in his day about authorship of II Peter, but he takes a short and sharp line with them.  The Petrine authorship and divine inspiration of II Peter as of l Peter, he says, is apprehended by \\\"any unbiased Christian\\u201d97\\\\xa0which is a good example of the preemptive strike in theological controversy. He refuses to admit catholic tradition, as authority for the genuineness and canonicity of the document but with equal vigour he rejects the Protestant assertion of private judgement; both alike tend to the deification of man and the dethronernent of God. Perhaps he would have allowed the appeal to the inward witness of the Spirit, but he does not explicitly say so. What he does say is more peremptory and he says it in criticism of Bishop Christopher Wordsworth\\\\'s argument that, in view of the many pseudepigrapha circulating in Peter\\\\'s name it was the church\\u2019s duty to suspend judgement on II Peter until adequate proofs of its authenticity were available.98\\u201cIt is never a duty,\\u201d says Kelly, \\u201ceven for the simplest Christian, to doubt scripture, but only to believe.\\u201d99\\\\xa0True but how is the simplest Christian to know in the first instance what is scripture and What is not? Kelly leaves this question unanswered, what is the more surprising in such an able thinker. Again, he may have held that the simplest Christian knows Scripture by the inward witness of the spirit but again, he does not explicity say so. Even so, the Spirit\\\\'s inward witness may assure me that what I hear or read is the word of God to me; it will hardly give an answer to questions of authorship or date.  It is noteworthy that when it comes to textual criticism or straight exegesis, as distinct from the history of the canon, Kelly can use his private judgement in as sound and uninhibited a manner as any other scholar, though he is always apt, having established the true test or the proper exegesis on a grammaticohistorical basis, to turn his weapon round and say that any spiritual and unprejudiced reader can see that this is the right way of it.  To us the canon is something \\u201creceived\\u201d --the books \\u201cdisputed by some\\\" being handed down with, and carried by, those \\u201cacknowledged by all.\\u201d100\\\\xa0Any talk of enlarging or contracting it at this time of day is unrealistic. We may toy with the fancy that some discovery to the future, like that of the Qumran or Nag Hammadi texts, may bring to light a lost letter of Paul\\u2019s, say his \\u201cprevious\\u201d letter to the Corinthians101\\\\xa0- or a copy of the Gospel of Mark complete with its \\u201clost\\u201d endingsupposing that it was not the Evangelist\\u2019s intention to finish at Mark 16:8. Would there be a move to have such a document added to the canon? It is difficult to see how this could be effected. For one thing, scholars would certainly not be unanimous about its authenticity. For another thing, there is no competent authority, acknowledged throughout Christendom, to decree its addition. Even if we could imagine the Pope, the Ecumenical Patriarch, and the presidents of the World Council of Churches and the International Council of Christian Churches agreeing to recommend the addition, there are some awkward nonconformists who would probably repudiate the idea just because it was recommended by one or all of these. If the analogy of history is relevant it suggests that the common consensus of Christians over several generations would have to precede any official pronouncement.  Suggestions that the Canon might be augmented by the inclusion of other \\u201cinspirational\\\" literature, ancient or mordern, arise from a failure to appreciate what the canon actually is. It is not an anthology of inspirational literature.The question is not what is to be read in church: when a sermon is read, the Congregation is treated to what is usually, in intention at least, inspirational literature, and the same may be said of prayers which are read from the prayer book or hymns which are read from the hymnbook. it is a question of getting as near as possible to the source of the Christian faith.  In a lecture delivered at Oxford in Professor Kurt Aland expressed this view that as the Old Testament canon underwent a de facto narrowing as a result of the new covenant established in Christ,102\\\\xa0so also the New Testament canon \\\"is in practice undergoing a narrowing and a shortening,\\\" so that we can recognize in the New Testament as in the Old a \\\"canon within the canon.\\\"103\\\\xa0This is a natural attitude on the part of a scholar in the Lutheran tradition; we know how depreciatory is the judgement passed today by many scholars in this tradition on those parts of the New Testament which smack of \\u201cprimitive catholicism.\\\"104 The \\u201cactual living, effective Canon,\\u201d as distinct from the formal canon, \\u201cis constructed according to the method of \\u2018self-understanding.\\u2019105\\\\xa0\\u201c But if it is suggested that Christians and churches get together and try to reach agreement on a common effective canon, the difficulty is that the \\u201ceffective\\u201d canon of some groups or individuals differs from that of others. If the inner canon to some consists of Romans and Galatians with the two Corinthian epistles, to others it consists of the Captivity Epistles, to others of the Synoptic Gospels, to others of the Johannine Gospels and Epistles, and to others one might be tempted to think of the Apocalypse.  It would be precarious to try to name any part of scripture --even the genealogical lists! --in which some believing reader has not heard the word of God addressing him effectively and in context. William Robertson Smith gave as his reason for believing in the Bible as the word of God \\u201cBecause the Bible is the only record of the redeeming love of God, because in the Bible alone I find God drawing near to man in Christ Jesus, and declaring to us, in Him, His will for our salvation. And this record I know to be true by the witness of His Spirit in my heart, whereby I am assured that none other thank God Himself is abl;e to speak such words to my soul.\\\"106\\\\xa0If he had been asked just where in the Bible he recognized this record and experienced this witness, he would probably not have mentioned every book, but he might well have said that the record of God\\\\'s love and the witness of the Spirit were so pervasive that they gave character to the Old and New Testament canon as a whole. Other readers might bear the same testimony, but might think of other parts of the Bible than Robertson Smith had in mind. No wonder, then, that Professor Aland speaks of the necessity of questioning one\\u2019s own actual canon and taking the actual canon of others seriously.107  The appeal to the testimony of the Holy Spirit is valid, but it will scarcely enable all to decide the precise limits of the canon. By an act of faith one may identify the New Testament canon as we have received it with the entire paradosis of Christ to which in Oscar Cullmann\\u2019s view, all the apostles contribute, each passing on to another that part which he himself received.108\\\\xa0This may be so, but it cannot be proved. It is better to say of the New Testament books what Hans Lietzmann said of the four Gospels in the early church, that \\\"the reference to their apostolic authority, which can only appear to us as a reminder of sound historical bases, had the deeper meaning that this particular tradition of Jesus and this alone had been established and guaranteed by the Holy Spirit working authoritatively in the Chruch.\\\"109\\\\xa0No doubt within \\u201cthis particular tradition\\u201d may be di strands of tradition indeed di traditions may be detected. But although critical scholars may emphasize their diversity, the church, both ancient and mordern, has been more conscious of their overall unity, in contrast to other interpretations which patently conflict with the New Testament witness but cannot substantiate a comparable claim to apostolic authority.  In the canon we have the foundation documents or the charter of the Christian faith. For no other document or group of documents from the earliest Christian generations can such a claim be made. Even the most debatable of the \\u201cdisputed\\u201d books in the New Testament canon has more of the quality of apostolic authority about it than the letters of Clement of Rome and Ignatius of Antioch or The Shepherd of Hermas. What has been said, however, is not tantamount to shutting the Holy Spirit up in a book or collection of books. Repeatedly, new movements the Spirit have been launched by a rediscovery of the living power which resides in the canon of Scripture. The New Testament \\\"not one of the paralysing and enslaving forces of the past, but it is full of eternal and present strength to make strong and to make free.\\\"   Footnotes:  1\\\\xa0Athanasius, Thirty-Ninth Festal Letter see p. 65.

Aramaic fragments of l Enoch have been found among the Qumran manuscripts; rather more than one-third of the work is extant in a Greek version.  5\\\\xa0I Enoch l:9 is quoted in Jude 14f.  6\\\\xa0I Cor. 15:33.  7\\\\xa0Titus1:12; cf.

Tertullian, accepting an antediluvian date for I Enoch, and regarding Jude\\u2019s quotation as lending authority to the book since Jude is in his eyes an apostle, adds the further consideration that \\\"nothing which pertains to us must be rejected by us\\\" On the Apparel of Women, 3.  9\\\\xa0Not only the references to fallen angels in Jude 6 and ll Pet. 2:4 cf. the \\\"spirits in prison\\\" of I Pet 3:19 i.e., to the trespassing \\u201csons of God\\u201d of Gen. 6:2, 4, on whose sin and penalty I Enoch enlarges but also the portrayal of the \\\"Son of Man\\\" in the independent section called the \\\"Similitudes of Enoch\\\" Enoch 37-71; cf.

It is evident from Ecclus. 48:22-49:10 that Ben Sira knew all the \\u201cLatter Prophets\\u201d\\u2014Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Twelve-as canonical. In the first half of the first century A.D. Philo of Alexandria speaks of the Therapeutae as studying \\u201claws, and oracles uttered through prophets, and hymns and the other things by which knowledge and piety are increased and brought to perfection\\u201d On the Contemplative Life, 25.  17\\\\xa0This is the most natural inference from His language about \\u201cthe blood of the all prophets shed from the foundation of the world . . . from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah\\u201d Luke 11:50f. \\u2014Zechariah being best identified with the martyred prophet of ll Chr. 24:20\\u2014 22.  18\\\\xa0\\u201cThe upshot of their debates was that, in spite of objections, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles and Esther were acknowledged as canonical; Ecclesiasticus was not acknowledged Babylonian Talmud Shabbat 30b; Mishnah Yadaim 3:5; Bahylonian Talmud Megillah 7a; Palestinian Talmud Megillah 70a. The Jamnia debates \\u201chave not so much dealt with the acceptance of certain writings into the Canon, but rather with their right to remain there\\u201d A. Bentzen, Introduction to the Old Testament i  , 31. There was some argument earlier in the school of Shammai about Ezekiel, long since included among the Prophets, but when an ingenious rabbi showed that he did not really contradict Moses, as had been alleged, misgivings were allayed TB Shabbat 13b.  19\\\\xa0Against Apion I. 37- 43. Since Josephus does not name the individual books,but classifies them in three groups of five, thirteen, and four respectively, wecannot say positively that his canon coincided precisely with that laid down at Jamnia, but if he reckoned Ruth as an appendix of Judges and Lamentations of Jeremiah, his total of twenty-two would correspond with the traditional twentyfour. Canonicity for him depends on prophetic inspiration, which dried up in the reign of Artaxerxes I: \\u201cOur history has also been written in detail from Artaxerxes to our own times, but is not esteemed as of equal authority with the books already mentioned, because the exact succession of prophets failed.\\u201d  20\\\\xa0E.g., the utterance of \\u201cthe Wisdom of God\\u201d in Luke 11:49; the passage beginning \\u201cWhat no eye has seen . . .\\u201d in I Cor. 2:9 and the \\u201cscripture\\u201d quoted in James 4:5.  21\\\\xa0See p. 61.  22\\\\xa0\\u201cJude 9; cf. Clement of Alexandria, Adumbrations on Jude. The relevant partof the Assumption of Muses is no longer extant.  23\\\\xa0The \\u201cBooks commonly called Apocrypha\\u201d Wesminster Confession I, 3 are I and Il Esdras III and IV Esdras in the Vulgate, Tobit, Judith, additions to Esther, Wisdom of Solomon, Ecclesiasticus Wisdom ofJesus ben Sira, Baruch, Letter of Jeremiah, Additions to Daniel The Prayer of Azariah and the Song of the Three Young Men, Susanna, Bel and the Dragon, Prayer of Manasseh, I and II Maccabees. There may be allusions to Wisdom in Rom. 1:18-2:16, but if so they express dissent as well as assent. The martyrs of the Maccabaean struggle cf. II Mace. 6- 7 are probably in view in Heb. 11:35b- 38, the author of which indeed was probably acquainted with IV Maccabees, but IV Maccabees was never accounted a canonical book. If the argument from silence is pressed, it shotuld be realized that one could apply it to Canticles and Esther, which are not quoted in the New Testament there may be allusions to Ecclesiates in Rom 8:20 and I Cor. 15:32.  24\\\\xa0Quoted by Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. IV.26.l4.  25\\\\xa0See p. 61. One objection to the canonical acceptance of Esther was the factthat the name of God makes no appearance in it; another voiced naturally among Jews rather than among Christians was its record of the institution of a new festival Purim, which conflicted with the view that all the festivals were instituted by Moses. Lamentations and Nehemiah are not specifically mentioned by Melito, but they may have been included with Jeremiah and Ezra respectively.  26\\\\xa0Cf. J. P. Audet, \\u201cA Hebrew-Aramaic List of Books of the Old Testament in 5 Greek,\\u201d JTS, NS I 1950, l35ff. Lamentations is not mentioned by name but may have been counted as an appendix to Jeremiah. This list makes the total twenty-seven.  27\\\\xa0Quoted by Eusebius, Hist. Eccl. VI.25.2. Origen\\u2019s total, like Josephus\\u2019s, is twenty-two.  28\\\\xa0Athanasius, Thirty-Ninth Festal Letter. His total also is twenty-two. To the five recommended books \\u201coutside our list\\u201d he adds The Shepherd of Hermas see p.60.  29\\\\xa0Prologue to Samuel Prologus Galeatus. The adjective \\u201capocryphal\\u201d Gk., \\u201chidden\\u201d had previously been used to denote books which were esoteric in content or withdrawn from general reading cf. II Esdras l4:46f.; Jerome uses it of those hooks which other church fathers called \\u201cecclesiastical\\u201d i.e., suitable for reading publicly in church.  30\\\\xa0\\u201cPrologue to books of Solomon. This is the passage referred to in Article VI: \\u201cAnd the other books as Hierome saith the Church doth read for example of life, and instruction of manners; but yet doth it not apply them to establish any doctrine.\\u201d  31\\\\xa0\\u201cAugustine points out that the books of the Maccabees and others \\u201care held as canonical not by the Jews but by the church\\u201d City of God xviii. 36. He further explains that books like I Enoch have no place in the canon \\u201cbecause their antiquity brought them under suspicion, and it was impossible to ascertain whether these were his   genuine writings\\u201d City of God xv. 23; cf. xviii. 38  32\\\\xa0\\u201cThe distinction between the Apocrypha and the books contained in the Hebrew Bible was preserved by some medieval scholars, especially those who knew Hebrew or at least paid attention to Jerome. Thus Hugh of St.-Victor died c. 1141 in a chapter De numero librorum sacri eloquii enumerates the books of the Hebrew Bible and adds: \\u201cThere are also in the Old Testament certain other books which are indeed read   but are not inscribed in the body of the text or in the canon of authority: such are the books of Tobit, Judith and the Maccabees, the so-called Wisdom of Solomon and Ecclesiasticus\\u201d De Sacramentis I, Prologue, chap. 7: Patrologia Latina 176, cols. 185- I86 D.  33\\\\xa0\\u201cRichard Hooker defends the Anglican attitude in his Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity, Vol. V London, 1597, p. 20.  34\\\\xa0\\u201cSessio IV, Decretum de canonicis scripturis. III and IV Esdras and the Prayer of Manasseh are not included in these books: III and IV Esdras  = I and II Esdras of the \\u201cProtestant\\u201d Apocryplia are placed in an appendix to the Vulgate and versions translated from it. The Eastern Church confirmed the canonicity of the apocryphal books included in the Septuagint in l642 and 1672.  35\\\\xa0Westminster Confession of Faith I, 3. The word \\u201cultimately\\u201d is used deliberately: earlier representatives of the Geneva tradition are not so uncompromising. Coverdale 1535, who first gathered the apocryphal books together as an appendix to the Old Testament, says he did so because \\u201cthere be many places in them, that seme to be repugnaunt vnto the open and manyfest trueth in the other bokes of the byble,\\u201d yet will not \\u201chaue them despysed, or little sett by\\u201d because if they are read in the light of the canonical books \\u201cthey shulde nether seme contrary, ner be vntruly & peruersly alledged.\\u201d The Geneva Bible 1560, following Jerome, says that \\u201cas bokes proceding from godlie men\\u201d they \\u201cwere receiued to be red for the aduancement and furtherance of the knowledge of the historic, & for the instruction of godlie maners: which bokes declare that at all times God had an especial care of his Church and left them not vtterly destitute of teachers and meanes to confirme them in the hope of the promised Messiah, and also witnesse that those calamities that God sent to his Church, were according to his prouidence, who had bothe so threatened by his Prophetes, and so broght it to passe for the destruction of their enemies, and for the tryal of his children.\\u201d  36\\\\xa0\\u201cDogmatic Constitution on the Catholic Faith: chap. 2, \\u201cOf Revelation.\\u201d Vatican II does not go into detail about the Old Testament canon.  37\\\\xa0Cf.

New Testament Apocrypha, ed. E. Hennecke, W. Schneemelcher, R. McL.

A sugarsticky girl shovelling scoopfuls of creams for a christian brother. Some school treat. Bad for their tummies. Lozenge and comfit manufacturer to His Majesty the King. God. Save. Our. Sitting on his throne sucking red jujubes white.  A sombre Y.M.C.A. young man, watchful among the warm sweet fumes of Graham Lemon's, placed a throwaway in a hand of Mr Bloom.  Heart to heart talks. Bloo... Me? No. Blood of the Lamb.  His slow feet walked him riverward, reading. Are you saved? All are washed in the blood of the lamb. God wants blood victim. Birth, hymen, martyr, war, foundation of a building, sacrifice, kidney burntoffering, druids' altars. Elijah is coming. Dr John Alexander Dowie restorer of the church in Zion is coming. Is coming! Is coming!! Is coming!!! All heartily welcome. Paying game. Torry and Alexander last year. Polygamy. His wife will put the stopper on that. Where was that ad some Birmingham firm the luminous crucifix. Our Saviour. Wake up in the dead of night and see him on the wall, hanging. Pepper's ghost idea. Iron nails ran in.  Phosphorus it must be done with. If you leave a bit of codfish for instance. I could see the bluey silver over it. Night I went down to the pantry in the kitchen. Don't like all the smells in it waiting to rush out. What was it she wanted? The Malaga raisins. Thinking of Spain. Before Rudy was born. The phosphorescence, that bluey greeny. Very good for the brain.  From Butler's monument house corner he glanced along Bachelor's walk. Dedalus' daughter there still outside Dillon's auctionrooms. Must be selling off some old furniture. Knew her eyes at once from the father. Lobbing about waiting for him. Home always breaks up when the mother goes. Fifteen children he had. Birth every year almost. That's in their theology or the priest won't give the poor woman the confession, the absolution. Increase and multiply. Did you ever hear such an idea? Eat you out of house and home. No families themselves to feed. Living on the fat of the land. Their butteries and larders. I'd like to see them do the black fast Yom Kippur. Crossbuns. One meal and a collation for fear he'd collapse on the altar. A housekeeper of one of those fellows if you could pick it out of her. Never pick it out of her. Like getting l.s.d. out of him. Does himself well. No guests. All for number one. Watching his water. Bring your own bread and butter. His reverence: mum's the word.  Good Lord, that poor child's dress is in flitters. Underfed she looks too. Potatoes and marge, marge and potatoes. It's after they feel it. Proof of the pudding. Undermines the constitution.  As he set foot on O'Connell bridge a puffball of smoke plumed up from the parapet. Brewery barge with export stout. England. Sea air sours it, I heard. Be interesting some day get a pass through Hancock to see the brewery. Regular world in itself. Vats of porter wonderful. Rats get in too. Drink themselves bloated as big as a collie floating. Dead drunk on the porter. Drink till they puke again like christians. Imagine drinking that! Rats: vats. Well, of course, if we knew all the things.  Looking down he saw flapping strongly, wheeling between the gaunt quaywalls, gulls. Rough weather outside. If I threw myself down? Reuben J's son must have swallowed a good bellyful of that sewage. One and eightpence too much. Hhhhm. It's the droll way he comes out with the things. Knows how to tell a story too.  They wheeled lower. Looking for grub. Wait.  He threw down among them a crumpled paper ball. Elijah thirtytwo feet per sec is com. Not a bit. The ball bobbed unheeded on the wake of swells, floated under by the bridgepiers. Not such damn fools. Also the day I threw that stale cake out of the Erin's King picked it up in the wake fifty yards astern. Live by their wits. They wheeled, flapping.  The hungry famished gull Flaps o'er the waters dull.  That is how poets write, the similar sounds. But then Shakespeare has no rhymes: blank verse. The flow of the language it is. The thoughts. Solemn.  Hamlet, I am thy father's spirit Doomed for a certain time to walk the earth. \\u2014Two apples a penny! Two for a penny!  His gaze passed over the glazed apples serried on her stand. Australians they must be this time of year. Shiny peels: polishes them up with a rag or a handkerchief. Wait. Those poor birds.  He halted again and bought from the old applewoman two Banbury cakes for a penny and broke the brittle paste and threw its fragments down into the Liffey. See that? The gulls swooped silently, two, then all from their heights, pouncing on prey. Gone. Every morsel.  Aware of their greed and cunning he shook the powdery crumb from his hands. They never expected that. Manna. Live on fish, fishy flesh they have, all seabirds, gulls, seagoose. Swans from Anna Liffey swim down here sometimes to preen themselves. No accounting for tastes. Wonder what kind is swanmeat. Robinson Crusoe had to live on them.  They wheeled flapping weakly. I'm not going to throw any more. Penny quite enough. Lot of thanks I get. Not even a caw. They spread foot and mouth disease too. If you cram a turkey say on chestnutmeal it tastes like that. Eat pig like pig. But then why is it that saltwater fish are not salty? How is that?  His eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchor on the treacly swells lazily its plastered board.  Kino's 11/- Trousers  Good idea that. Wonder if he pays rent to the corporation. How can you own water really? It's always flowing in a stream, never the same, which in the stream of life we trace. Because life is a stream. All kinds of places are good for ads. That quack doctor for the clap used to be stuck up in all the greenhouses. Never see it now. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks. Didn't cost him a red like Maginni the dancing master self advertisement. Got fellows to stick them up or stick them up himself for that matter on the q. t. running in to loosen a button. Flybynight. Just the place too. POST NO BILLS. POST 110 PILLS. Some chap with a dose burning him.  If he...? O!  Eh?  No... No.  No, no. I don't believe it. He wouldn't surely?  No, no.  Mr Bloom moved forward, raising his troubled eyes. Think no more about that. After one. Timeball on the ballastoffice is down. Dunsink time. Fascinating little book that is of sir Robert Ball's. Parallax. I never exactly understood. There's a priest. Could ask him. Par it's Greek: parallel, parallax. Met him pike hoses she called it till I told her about the transmigration. O rocks! Mr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballastoffice. She's right after all. Only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound. She's not exactly witty. Can be rude too. Blurt out what I was thinking. Still, I don't know. She used to say Ben Dollard had a base barreltone voice. He has legs like barrels and you'd think he was singing into a barrel. Now, isn't that wit. They used to call him big Ben. Not half as witty as calling him base barreltone. Appetite like an albatross. Get outside of a baron of beef. Powerful man he was at stowing away number one Bass. Barrel of Bass. See? It all works out.  A procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards. Bargains. Like that priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered. He read the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H. E. L. Y. S. Wisdom Hely's. Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his foreboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked. Our staple food. Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after street. Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly. They are not Boyl: no, M Glade's men. Doesn't bring in any business either. I suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper. I bet that would have caught on. Smart girls writing something catch the eye at once. Everyone dying to know what she's writing. Get twenty of them round you if you stare at nothing. Have a finger in the pie. Women too. Curiosity. Pillar of salt. Wouldn't have it of course because he didn't think of it himself first. Or the inkbottle I suggested with a false stain of black celluloid. His ideas for ads like Plumtree's potted under the obituaries, cold meat department. You can't lick 'em. What? Our envelopes. Hello, Jones, where are you going? Can't stop, Robinson, I am hastening to purchase the only reliable inkeraser Kansell, sold by Hely's Ltd, 85 Dame street. Well out of that ruck I am. Devil of a job it was collecting accounts of those convents. Tranquilla convent. That was a nice nun there, really sweet face. Wimple suited her small head. Sister? Sister? I am sure she was crossed in love by her eyes. Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman. I disturbed her at her devotions that morning. But glad to communicate with the outside world. Our great day, she said. Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Sweet name too: caramel. She knew I, I think she knew by the way she. If she had married she would have changed. I suppose they really were short of money. Fried everything in the best butter all the same. No lard for them. My heart's broke eating dripping. They like buttering themselves in and out. Molly tasting it, her veil up. Sister? Pat Claffey, the pawnbroker's daughter. It was a nun they say invented barbed wire.  He crossed Westmoreland street when apostrophe S had plodded by. Rover cycleshop. Those races are on today. How long ago is that? Year Phil Gilligan died. We were in Lombard street west. Wait: was in Thom's. Got the job in Wisdom Hely's year we married. Six years. Ten years ago: ninetyfour he died yes that's right the big fire at Arnott's. Val Dillon was lord mayor. The Glencree dinner. Alderman Robert O'Reilly emptying the port into his soup before the flag fell. Bobbob lapping it for the inner alderman. Couldn't hear what the band played. For what we have already received may the Lord make us. Milly was a kiddy then. Molly had that elephantgrey dress with the braided frogs. Mantailored with selfcovered buttons. She didn't like it because I sprained my ankle first day she wore choir picnic at the Sugarloaf. As if that. Old Goodwin's tall hat done up with some sticky stuff. Flies' picnic too. Never put a dress on her back like it. Fitted her like a glove, shoulders and hips. Just beginning to plump it out well. Rabbitpie we had that day. People looking after her.  Happy. Happier then. Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper. Dockrell's, one and ninepence a dozen. Milly's tubbing night. American soap I bought: elderflower. Cosy smell of her bathwater. Funny she looked soaped all over. Shapely too. Now photography. Poor papa's daguerreotype atelier he told me of. Hereditary taste.  He walked along the curbstone.  Stream of life. What was the name of that priestylooking chap was always squinting in when he passed? Weak eyes, woman. Stopped in Citron's saint Kevin's parade. Pen something. Pendennis? My memory is getting. Pen ...? Of course it's years ago. Noise of the trams probably. Well, if he couldn't remember the dayfather's name that he sees every day.  Bartell d'Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then. Seeing her home after practice. Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache. Gave her that song Winds that blow from the south.  Windy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting on about those lottery tickets after Goodwin's concert in the supperroom or oakroom of the Mansion house. He and I behind. Sheet of her music blew out of my hand against the High school railings. Lucky it didn't. Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her. Professor Goodwin linking her in front. Shaky on his pins, poor old sot. His farewell concerts. Positively last appearance on any stage. May be for months and may be for never. Remember her laughing at the wind, her blizzard collar up. Corner of Harcourt road remember that gust. Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered old Goodwin. She did get flushed in the wind. Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her supper with the Chutney sauce she liked. And the mulled rum. Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays: white.  Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed. Always warm from her. Always liked to let her self out. Sitting there after till near two taking out her hairpins. Milly tucked up in beddyhouse. Happy. Happy. That was the night...  \\u2014O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?  \\u2014O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?  \\u2014No use complaining. How is Molly those times? Haven't seen her for ages.  \\u2014In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily. Milly has a position down in Mullingar, you know.  \\u2014Go away! Isn't that grand for her?  \\u2014Yes. In a photographer's there. Getting on like a house on fire. How are all your charges?  \\u2014All on the baker's list, Mrs Breen said.  How many has she? No other in sight.  \\u2014You're in black, I see. You have no...  \\u2014No, Mr Bloom said. I have just come from a funeral.  Going to crop up all day, I foresee. Who's dead, when and what did he die of? Turn up like a bad penny.  \\u2014O, dear me, Mrs Breen said. I hope it wasn't any near relation.  May as well get her sympathy.  \\u2014Dignam, Mr Bloom said. An old friend of mine. He died quite suddenly, poor fellow. Heart trouble, I believe. Funeral was this morning.  Your funeral's tomorrow While you're coming through the rye. Diddlediddle dumdum Diddlediddle...  \\u2014Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen's womaneyes said melancholily.  Now that's quite enough about that. Just: quietly: husband.  \\u2014And your lord and master?  Mrs Breen turned up her two large eyes. Hasn't lost them anyhow.  \\u2014O, don't be talking! she said. He's a caution to rattlesnakes. He's in there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel. He has me heartscalded. Wait till I show you.  Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured out from Harrison's. The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom's gullet. Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar, or they'd taste it with the hot tea. Or is it from her? A barefoot arab stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes. Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way. Pleasure or pain is it? Penny dinner. Knife and fork chained to the table.  Opening her handbag, chipped leather. Hatpin: ought to have a guard on those things. Stick it in a chap's eye in the tram. Rummaging. Open. Money. Please take one. Devils if they lose sixpence. Raise Cain. Husband barging. Where's the ten shillings I gave you on Monday? Are you feeding your little brother's family? Soiled handkerchief: medicinebottle. Pastille that was fell. What is she?...  \\u2014There must be a new moon out, she said. He's always bad then. Do you know what he did last night?  Her hand ceased to rummage. Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in alarm, yet smiling.  \\u2014What? Mr Bloom asked.  Let her speak. Look straight in her eyes. I believe you. Trust me.  \\u2014Woke me up in the night, she said. Dream he had, a nightmare.  Indiges.  \\u2014Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.  \\u2014The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.  She took a folded postcard from her handbag.  \\u2014Read that, she said. He got it this morning.  \\u2014What is it? Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. U.P.?  \\u2014U.P.: up, she said. Someone taking a rise out of him. It's a great shame for them whoever he is.  \\u2014Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.  She took back the card, sighing.  \\u2014And now he's going round to Mr Menton's office. He's going to take an action for ten thousand pounds, he says.  She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.  Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. Seen its best days. Wispish hair over her ears. And that dowdy toque: three old grapes to take the harm out of it. Shabby genteel. She used to be a tasty dresser. Lines round her mouth. Only a year or so older than Molly.  See the eye that woman gave her, passing. Cruel. The unfair sex.  He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent. Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny. I'm hungry too. Flakes of pastry on the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her cheek. Rhubarb tart with liberal fillings, rich fruit interior. Josie Powell that was. In Luke Doyle's long ago. Dolphin's Barn, the charades. U.P.: up.  Change the subject.  \\u2014Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy? Mr Bloom asked.  \\u2014Mina Purefoy? she said.  Philip Beaufoy I was thinking. Playgoers' Club. Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke. Did I pull the chain? Yes. The last act.  \\u2014Yes.  \\u2014I just called to ask on the way in is she over it. She's in the lying-in hospital in Holles street. Dr Horne got her in. She's three days bad now.  \\u2014O, Mr Bloom said. I'm sorry to hear that.  \\u2014Yes, Mrs Breen said. And a houseful of kids at home. It's a very stiff birth, the nurse told me.  \\u2014-O, Mr Bloom said.  His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news. His tongue clacked in compassion. Dth! Dth!  \\u2014I'm sorry to hear that, he said. Poor thing! Three days! That's terrible for her.  Mrs Breen nodded.  \\u2014She was taken bad on the Tuesday...  Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:  \\u2014Mind! Let this man pass.  A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass. Tight as a skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head. From his arm a folded dustcoat, a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.  \\u2014Watch him, Mr Bloom said. He always walks outside the lampposts. Watch!  \\u2014Who is he if it's a fair question? Mrs Breen asked. Is he dotty?  \\u2014His name is Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr Bloom said smiling. Watch!  \\u2014He has enough of them, she said. Denis will be like that one of these days.  She broke off suddenly.  \\u2014There he is, she said. I must go after him. Goodbye. Remember me to Molly, won't you?  \\u2014I will, Mr Bloom said.  He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts. Denis Breen in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrison's hugging two heavy tomes to his ribs. Blown in from the bay. Like old times. He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and thrust his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he spoke earnestly.  Meshuggah. Off his chump.  Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the tight skullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat. Going the two days. Watch him! Out he goes again. One way of getting on in the world. And that other old mosey lunatic in those duds. Hard time she must have with him.  U.P.: up. I'll take my oath that's Alf Bergan or Richie Goulding. Wrote it for a lark in the Scotch house I bet anything. Round to Menton's office. His oyster eyes staring at the postcard. Be a feast for the gods.  He passed the Irish Times. There might be other answers Iying there. Like to answer them all. Good system for criminals. Code. At their lunch now. Clerk with the glasses there doesn't know me. O, leave them there to simmer. Enough bother wading through fortyfour of them. Wanted, smart lady typist to aid gentleman in literary work. I called you naughty darling because I do not like that other world. Please tell me what is the meaning. Please tell me what perfume does your wife. Tell me who made the world. The way they spring those questions on you. And the other one Lizzie Twigg. My literary efforts have had the good fortune to meet with the approval of the eminent poet A. E. Mr Geo. Russell. No time to do her hair drinking sloppy tea with a book of poetry.  Best paper by long chalks for a small ad. Got the provinces now. Cook and general, exc. cuisine, housemaid kept. Wanted live man for spirit counter. Resp. girl R.C. wishes to hear of post in fruit or pork shop. James Carlisle made that. Six and a half per cent dividend. Made a big deal on Coates's shares. Ca' canny. Cunning old Scotch hunks. All the toady news. Our gracious and popular vicereine. Bought the Irish Field now. Lady Mountcashel has quite recovered after her confinement and rode out with the Ward Union staghounds at the enlargement yesterday at Rathoath. Uneatable fox. Pothunters too. Fear injects juices make it tender enough for them. Riding astride. Sit her horse like a man. Weightcarrying huntress. No sidesaddle or pillion for her, not for Joe. First to the meet and in at the death. Strong as a brood mare some of those horsey women. Swagger around livery stables. Toss off a glass of brandy neat while you'd say knife. That one at the Grosvenor this morning. Up with her on the car: wishswish. Stonewall or fivebarred gate put her mount to it. Think that pugnosed driver did it out of spite. Who is this she was like? O yes! Mrs Miriam Dandrade that sold me her old wraps and black underclothes in the Shelbourne hotel. Divorced Spanish American. Didn't take a feather out of her my handling them. As if I was her clotheshorse. Saw her in the viceregal party when Stubbs the park ranger got me in with Whelan of the Express. Scavenging what the quality left. High tea. Mayonnaise I poured on the plums thinking it was custard. Her ears ought to have tingled for a few weeks after. Want to be a bull for her. Born courtesan. No nursery work for her, thanks.  Poor Mrs Purefoy! Methodist husband. Method in his madness. Saffron bun and milk and soda lunch in the educational dairy. Y. M. C. A. Eating with a stopwatch, thirtytwo chews to the minute. And still his muttonchop whiskers grew. Supposed to be well connected. Theodore's cousin in Dublin Castle. One tony relative in every family. Hardy annuals he presents her with. Saw him out at the Three Jolly Topers marching along bareheaded and his eldest boy carrying one in a marketnet. The squallers. Poor thing! Then having to give the breast year after year all hours of the night. Selfish those t.t's are. Dog in the manger. Only one lump of sugar in my tea, if you please.  He stood at Fleet street crossing. Luncheon interval. A sixpenny at Rowe's? Must look up that ad in the national library. An eightpenny in the Burton. Better. On my way.  He walked on past Bolton's Westmoreland house. Tea. Tea. Tea. I forgot to tap Tom Kernan.  Sss. Dth, dth, dth! Three days imagine groaning on a bed with a vinegared handkerchief round her forehead, her belly swollen out. Phew! Dreadful simply! Child's head too big: forceps. Doubled up inside her trying to butt its way out blindly, groping for the way out. Kill me that would. Lucky Molly got over hers lightly. They ought to invent something to stop that. Life with hard labour. Twilight sleep idea: queen Victoria was given that. Nine she had. A good layer. Old woman that lived in a shoe she had so many children. Suppose he was consumptive. Time someone thought about it instead of gassing about the what was it the pensive bosom of the silver effulgence. Flapdoodle to feed fools on. They could easily have big establishments whole thing quite painless out of all the taxes give every child born five quid at compound interest up to twentyone five per cent is a hundred shillings and five tiresome pounds multiply by twenty decimal system encourage people to put by money save hundred and ten and a bit twentyone years want to work it out on paper come to a tidy sum more than you think.  Not stillborn of course. They are not even registered. Trouble for nothing.  Funny sight two of them together, their bellies out. Molly and Mrs Moisel. Mothers' meeting. Phthisis retires for the time being, then returns. How flat they look all of a sudden after. Peaceful eyes. Weight off their mind. Old Mrs Thornton was a jolly old soul. All my babies, she said. The spoon of pap in her mouth before she fed them. O, that's nyumnyum. Got her hand crushed by old Tom Wall's son. His first bow to the public. Head like a prize pumpkin. Snuffy Dr Murren. People knocking them up at all hours. For God' sake, doctor. Wife in her throes. Then keep them waiting months for their fee. To attendance on your wife. No gratitude in people. Humane doctors, most of them.  Before the huge high door of the Irish house of parliament a flock of pigeons flew. Their little frolic after meals. Who will we do it on? I pick the fellow in black. Here goes. Here's good luck. Must be thrilling from the air. Apjohn, myself and Owen Goldberg up in the trees near Goose green playing the monkeys. Mackerel they called me.  A squad of constables debouched from College street, marching in Indian file. Goosestep. Foodheated faces, sweating helmets, patting their truncheons. After their feed with a good load of fat soup under their belts. Policeman's lot is oft a happy one. They split up in groups and scattered, saluting, towards their beats. Let out to graze. Best moment to attack one in pudding time. A punch in his dinner. A squad of others, marching irregularly, rounded Trinity railings making for the station. Bound for their troughs. Prepare to receive cavalry. Prepare to receive soup.  He crossed under Tommy Moore's roguish finger. They did right to put him up over a urinal: meeting of the waters. Ought to be places for women. Running into cakeshops. Settle my hat straight. There is not in this wide world a vallee. Great song of Julia Morkan's. Kept her voice up to the very last. Pupil of Michael Balfe's, wasn't she?  He gazed after the last broad tunic. Nasty customers to tackle. Jack Power could a tale unfold: father a G man. If a fellow gave them trouble being lagged they let him have it hot and heavy in the bridewell. Can't blame them after all with the job they have especially the young hornies. That horsepoliceman the day Joe Chamberlain was given his degree in Trinity he got a run for his money. My word he did! His horse's hoofs clattering after us down Abbey street. Lucky I had the presence of mind to dive into Manning's or I was souped. He did come a wallop, by George. Must have cracked his skull on the cobblestones. I oughtn't to have got myself swept along with those medicals. And the Trinity jibs in their mortarboards. Looking for trouble. Still I got to know that young Dixon who dressed that sting for me in the Mater and now he's in Holles street where Mrs Purefoy. Wheels within wheels. Police whistle in my ears still. All skedaddled. Why he fixed on me. Give me in charge. Right here it began.  \\u2014Up the Boers!  \\u2014Three cheers for De Wet!  \\u2014We'll hang Joe Chamberlain on a sourapple tree.  Silly billies: mob of young cubs yelling their guts out. Vinegar hill. The Butter exchange band. Few years' time half of them magistrates and civil servants. War comes on: into the army helterskelter: same fellows used to. Whether on the scaffold high.  Never know who you're talking to. Corny Kelleher he has Harvey Duff in his eye. Like that Peter or Denis or James Carey that blew the gaff on the invincibles. Member of the corporation too. Egging raw youths on to get in the know all the time drawing secret service pay from the castle. Drop him like a hot potato. Why those plainclothes men are always courting slaveys. Easily twig a man used to uniform. Squarepushing up against a backdoor. Maul her a bit. Then the next thing on the menu. And who is the gentleman does be visiting there? Was the young master saying anything? Peeping Tom through the keyhole. Decoy duck. Hotblooded young student fooling round her fat arms ironing.  \\u2014Are those yours, Mary?  \\u2014I don't wear such things... Stop or I'll tell the missus on you. Out half the night.  \\u2014There are great times coming, Mary. Wait till you see.  \\u2014Ah, gelong with your great times coming.  Barmaids too. Tobaccoshopgirls.  James Stephens' idea was the best. He knew them. Circles of ten so that a fellow couldn't round on more than his own ring. Sinn Fein. Back out you get the knife. Hidden hand. Stay in. The firing squad. Turnkey's daughter got him out of Richmond, off from Lusk. Putting up in the Buckingham Palace hotel under their very noses. Garibaldi.  You must have a certain fascination: Parnell. Arthur Griffith is a squareheaded fellow but he has no go in him for the mob. Or gas about our lovely land. Gammon and spinach. Dublin Bakery Company's tearoom. Debating societies. That republicanism is the best form of government. That the language question should take precedence of the economic question. Have your daughters inveigling them to your house. Stuff them up with meat and drink. Michaelmas goose. Here's a good lump of thyme seasoning under the apron for you. Have another quart of goosegrease before it gets too cold. Halffed enthusiasts. Penny roll and a walk with the band. No grace for the carver. The thought that the other chap pays best sauce in the world. Make themselves thoroughly at home. Show us over those apricots, meaning peaches. The not far distant day. Homerule sun rising up in the northwest.  His smile faded as he walked, a heavy cloud hiding the sun slowly, shadowing Trinity's surly front. Trams passed one another, ingoing, outgoing, clanging. Useless words. Things go on same, day after day: squads of police marching out, back: trams in, out. Those two loonies mooching about. Dignam carted off. Mina Purefoy swollen belly on a bed groaning to have a child tugged out of her. One born every second somewhere. Other dying every second. Since I fed the birds five minutes. Three hundred kicked the bucket. Other three hundred born, washing the blood off, all are washed in the blood of the lamb, bawling maaaaaa.  Cityful passing away, other cityful coming, passing away too: other coming on, passing on. Houses, lines of houses, streets, miles of pavements, piledup bricks, stones. Changing hands. This owner, that. Landlord never dies they say. Other steps into his shoes when he gets his notice to quit. They buy the place up with gold and still they have all the gold. Swindle in it somewhere. Piled up in cities, worn away age after age. Pyramids in sand. Built on bread and onions. Slaves Chinese wall. Babylon. Big stones left. Round towers. Rest rubble, sprawling suburbs, jerrybuilt. Kerwan's mushroom houses built of breeze. Shelter, for the night.  No-one is anything.  This is the very worst hour of the day. Vitality. Dull, gloomy: hate this hour. Feel as if I had been eaten and spewed.  Provost's house. The reverend Dr Salmon: tinned salmon. Well tinned in there. Like a mortuary chapel. Wouldn't live in it if they paid me. Hope they have liver and bacon today. Nature abhors a vacuum.  The sun freed itself slowly and lit glints of light among the silverware opposite in Walter Sexton's window by which John Howard Parnell passed, unseeing.  There he is: the brother. Image of him. Haunting face. Now that's a coincidence. Course hundreds of times you think of a person and don't meet him. Like a man walking in his sleep. No-one knows him. Must be a corporation meeting today. They say he never put on the city marshal's uniform since he got the job. Charley Kavanagh used to come out on his high horse, cocked hat, puffed, powdered and shaved. Look at the woebegone walk of him. Eaten a bad egg. Poached eyes on ghost. I have a pain. Great man's brother: his brother's brother. He'd look nice on the city charger. Drop into the D.B.C. probably for his coffee, play chess there. His brother used men as pawns. Let them all go to pot. Afraid to pass a remark on him. Freeze them up with that eye of his. That's the fascination: the name. All a bit touched. Mad Fanny and his other sister Mrs Dickinson driving about with scarlet harness. Bolt upright lik surgeon M'Ardle. Still David Sheehy beat him for south Meath. Apply for the Chiltern Hundreds and retire into public life. The patriot's banquet. Eating orangepeels in the park. Simon Dedalus said when they put him in parliament that Parnell would come back from the grave and lead him out of the house of commons by the arm.  \\u2014Of the twoheaded octopus, one of whose heads is the head upon which the ends of the world have forgotten to come while the other speaks with a Scotch accent. The tentacles...  They passed from behind Mr Bloom along the curbstone. Beard and bicycle. Young woman.  And there he is too. Now that's really a coincidence: second time. Coming events cast their shadows before. With the approval of the eminent poet, Mr Geo. Russell. That might be Lizzie Twigg with him. A. E.: what does that mean? Initials perhaps. Albert Edward, Arthur Edmund, Alphonsus Eb Ed El Esquire. What was he saying? The ends of the world with a Scotch accent. Tentacles: octopus. Something occult: symbolism. Holding forth. She's taking it all in. Not saying a word. To aid gentleman in literary work.  His eyes followed the high figure in homespun, beard and bicycle, a listening woman at his side. Coming from the vegetarian. Only weggebobbles and fruit. Don't eat a beefsteak. If you do the eyes of that cow will pursue you through all eternity. They say it's healthier. Windandwatery though. Tried it. Keep you on the run all day. Bad as a bloater. Dreams all night. Why do they call that thing they gave me nutsteak? Nutarians. Fruitarians. To give you the idea you are eating rumpsteak. Absurd. Salty too. They cook in soda. Keep you sitting by the tap all night.  Her stockings are loose over her ankles. I detest that: so tasteless. Those literary etherial people they are all. Dreamy, cloudy, symbolistic. Esthetes they are. I wouldn't be surprised if it was that kind of food you see produces the like waves of the brain the poetical. For example one of those policemen sweating Irish stew into their shirts you couldn't squeeze a line of poetry out of him. Don't know what poetry is even. Must be in a certain mood.  The dreamy cloudy gull Waves o'er the waters dull.  He crossed at Nassau street corner and stood before the window of Yeates and Son, pricing the fieldglasses. Or will I drop into old Harris's and have a chat with young Sinclair? Wellmannered fellow. Probably at his lunch. Must get those old glasses of mine set right. Goerz lenses six guineas. Germans making their way everywhere. Sell on easy terms to capture trade. Undercutting. Might chance on a pair in the railway lost property office. Astonishing the things people leave behind them in trains and cloakrooms. What do they be thinking about? Women too. Incredible. Last year travelling to Ennis had to pick up that farmer's daughter's ba and hand it to her at Limerick junction. Unclaimed money too. There's a little watch up there on the roof of the bank to test those glasses by.  His lids came down on the lower rims of his irides. Can't see it. If you imagine it's there you can almost see it. Can't see it.  He faced about and, standing between the awnings, held out his right hand at arm's length towards the sun. Wanted to try that often. Yes: completely. The tip of his little finger blotted out the sun's disk. Must be the focus where the rays cross. If I had black glasses. Interesting. There was a lot of talk about those sunspots when we were in Lombard street west. Looking up from the back garden. Terrific explosions they are. There will be a total eclipse this year: autumn some time.  Now that I come to think of it that ball falls at Greenwich time. It's the clock is worked by an electric wire from Dunsink. Must go out there some first Saturday of the month. If I could get an introduction to professor Joly or learn up something about his family. That would do to: man always feels complimented. Flattery where least expected. Nobleman proud to be descended from some king's mistress. His foremother. Lay it on with a trowel. Cap in hand goes through the land. Not go in and blurt out what you know you're not to: what's parallax? Show this gentleman the door.  Ah.  His hand fell to his side again.  Never know anything about it. Waste of time. Gasballs spinning about, crossing each other, passing. Same old dingdong always. Gas: then solid: then world: then cold: then dead shell drifting around, frozen rock, like that pineapple rock. The moon. Must be a new moon out, she said. I believe there is.  He went on by la maison Claire.  Wait. The full moon was the night we were Sunday fortnight exactly there is a new moon. Walking down by the Tolka. Not bad for a Fairview moon. She was humming. The young May moon she's beaming, love. He other side of her. Elbow, arm. He. Glowworm's la-amp is gleaming, love. Touch. Fingers. Asking. Answer. Yes.  Stop. Stop. If it was it was. Must.  Mr Bloom, quickbreathing, slowlier walking passed Adam court.  With a keep quiet relief his eyes took note this is the street here middle of the day of Bob Doran's bottle shoulders. On his annual bend, M Coy said. They drink in order to say or do something or cherchez la femme. Up in the Coombe with chummies and streetwalkers and then the rest of the year sober as a judge.  Yes. Thought so. Sloping into the Empire. Gone. Plain soda would do him good. Where Pat Kinsella had his Harp theatre before Whitbred ran the Queen's. Broth of a boy. Dion Boucicault business with his harvestmoon face in a poky bonnet. Three Purty Maids from School. How time flies, eh? Showing long red pantaloons under his skirts. Drinkers, drinking, laughed spluttering, their drink against their breath. More power, Pat. Coarse red: fun for drunkards: guffaw and smoke. Take off that white hat. His parboiled eyes. Where is he now? Beggar somewhere. The harp that once did starve us all.  I was happier then. Or was that I? Or am I now I? Twentyeight I was. She twentythree. When we left Lombard street west something changed. Could never like it again after Rudy. Can't bring back time. Like holding water in your hand. Would you go back to then? Just beginning then. Would you? Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy? Wants to sew on buttons for me. I must answer. Write it in the library.  Grafton street gay with housed awnings lured his senses. Muslin prints, silkdames and dowagers, jingle of harnesses, hoofthuds lowringing in the baking causeway. Thick feet that woman has in the white stockings. Hope the rain mucks them up on her. Countrybred chawbacon. All the beef to the heels were in. Always gives a woman clumsy feet. Molly looks out of plumb.  He passed, dallying, the windows of Brown Thomas, silk mercers. Cascades of ribbons. Flimsy China silks. A tilted urn poured from its mouth a flood of bloodhued poplin: lustrous blood. The huguenots brought that here. La causa \\u00e8 santa! Tara tara. Great chorus that. Taree tara. Must be washed in rainwater. Meyerbeer. Tara: bom bom bom.  Pincushions. I'm a long time threatening to buy one. Sticking them all over the place. Needles in window curtains.  He bared slightly his left forearm. Scrape: nearly gone. Not today anyhow. Must go back for that lotion. For her birthday perhaps. Junejulyaugseptember eighth. Nearly three months off. Then she mightn't like it. Women won't pick up pins. Say it cuts lo.  Gleaming silks, petticoats on slim brass rails, rays of flat silk stockings.  Useless to go back. Had to be. Tell me all.  High voices. Sunwarm silk. Jingling harnesses. All for a woman, home and houses, silkwebs, silver, rich fruits spicy from Jaffa. Agendath Netaim. Wealth of the world.  A warm human plumpness settled down on his brain. His brain yielded. Perfume of embraces all him assailed. With hungered flesh obscurely, he mutely craved to adore.  Duke street. Here we are. Must eat. The Burton. Feel better then.  He turned Combridge's corner, still pursued. Jingling, hoofthuds. Perfumed bodies, warm, full. All kissed, yielded: in deep summer fields, tangled pressed grass, in trickling hallways of tenements, along sofas, creaking beds.  \\u2014Jack, love!  \\u2014Darling!  \\u2014Kiss me, Reggy!  \\u2014My boy!  \\u2014Love!  His heart astir he pushed in the door of the Burton restaurant. Stink gripped his trembling breath: pungent meatjuice, slush of greens. See the animals feed.  Men, men, men.  Perched on high stools by the bar, hats shoved back, at the tables calling for more bread no charge, swilling, wolfing gobfuls of sloppy food, their eyes bulging, wiping wetted moustaches. A pallid suetfaced young man polished his tumbler knife fork and spoon with his napkin. New set of microbes. A man with an infant's saucestained napkin tucked round him shovelled gurgling soup down his gullet. A man spitting back on his plate: halfmasticated gristle: gums: no teeth to chewchewchew it. Chump chop from the grill. Bolting to get it over. Sad booser's eyes. Bitten off more than he can chew. Am I like that? See ourselves as others see us. Hungry man is an angry man. Working tooth and jaw. Don't! O! A bone! That last pagan king of Ireland Cormac in the schoolpoem choked himself at Sletty southward of the Boyne. Wonder what he was eating. Something galoptious. Saint Patrick converted him to Christianity. Couldn't swallow it all however.  \\u2014Roast beef and cabbage.  \\u2014One stew.  Smells of men. His gorge rose. Spaton sawdust, sweetish warmish cigarette smoke, reek of plug, spilt beer, men's beery piss, the stale of ferment.  Couldn't eat a morsel here. Fellow sharpening knife and fork to eat all before him, old chap picking his tootles. Slight spasm, full, chewing the cud. Before and after. Grace after meals. Look on this picture then on that. Scoffing up stewgravy with sopping sippets of bread. Lick it off the plate, man! Get out of this.  He gazed round the stooled and tabled eaters, tightening the wings of his nose.  \\u2014Two stouts here.  \\u2014One corned and cabbage.  That fellow ramming a knifeful of cabbage down as if his life depended on it. Good stroke. Give me the fidgets to look. Safer to eat from his three hands. Tear it limb from limb. Second nature to him. Born with a silver knife in his mouth. That's witty, I think. Or no. Silver means born rich. Born with a knife. But then the allusion is lost.  An illgirt server gathered sticky clattering plates. Rock, the head bailiff, standing at the bar blew the foamy crown from his tankard. Well up: it splashed yellow near his boot. A diner, knife and fork upright, elbows on table, ready for a second helping stared towards the foodlift across his stained square of newspaper. Other chap telling him something with his mouth full. Sympathetic listener. Table talk. I munched hum un thu Unchster Bunk un Munchday. Ha? Did you, faith?  Mr Bloom raised two fingers doubtfully to his lips. His eyes said:  \\u2014Not here. Don't see him.  Out. I hate dirty eaters.  He backed towards the door. Get a light snack in Davy Byrne's. Stopgap. Keep me going. Had a good breakfast.  \\u2014Roast and mashed here.  \\u2014Pint of stout.  Every fellow for his own, tooth and nail. Gulp. Grub. Gulp. Gobstuff.  He came out into clearer air and turned back towards Grafton street. Eat or be eaten. Kill! Kill!  Suppose that communal kitchen years to come perhaps. All trotting down with porringers and tommycans to be filled. Devour contents in the street. John Howard Parnell example the provost of Trinity every mother's son don't talk of your provosts and provost of Trinity women and children cabmen priests parsons fieldmarshals archbishops. From Ailesbury road, Clyde road, artisans' dwellings, north Dublin union, lord mayor in his gingerbread coach, old queen in a bathchair. My plate's empty. After you with our incorporated drinkingcup. Like sir Philip Crampton's fountain. Rub off the microbes with your handkerchief. Next chap rubs on a new batch with his. Father O'Flynn would make hares of them all. Have rows all the same. All for number one. Children fighting for the scrapings of the pot. Want a souppot as big as the Phoenix park. Harpooning flitches and hindquarters out of it. Hate people all round you. City Arms hotel table d'h\\u00f4te she called it. Soup, joint and sweet. Never know whose thoughts you're chewing. Then who'd wash up all the plates and forks? Might be all feeding on tabloids that time. Teeth getting worse and worse.  After all there's a lot in that vegetarian fine flavour of things from the earth garlic of course it stinks after Italian organgrinders crisp of onions mushrooms truffles. Pain to the animal too. Pluck and draw fowl. Wretched brutes there at the cattlemarket waiting for the poleaxe to split their skulls open. Moo. Poor trembling calves. Meh. Staggering bob. Bubble and squeak. Butchers' buckets wobbly lights. Give us that brisket off the hook. Plup. Rawhead and bloody bones. Flayed glasseyed sheep hung from their haunches, sheepsnouts bloodypapered snivelling nosejam on sawdust. Top and lashers going out. Don't maul them pieces, young one.  Hot fresh blood they prescribe for decline. Blood always needed. Insidious. Lick it up smokinghot, thick sugary. Famished ghosts.  Ah, I'm hungry.  He entered Davy Byrne's. Moral pub. He doesn't chat. Stands a drink now and then. But in leapyear once in four. Cashed a cheque for me once.  What will I take now? He drew his watch. Let me see now. Shandygaff?  \\u2014Hello, Bloom, Nosey Flynn said from his nook.  \\u2014Hello, Flynn.  \\u2014How's things?  \\u2014Tiptop... Let me see. I'll take a glass of burgundy and... let me see.  Sardines on the shelves. Almost taste them by looking. Sandwich? Ham and his descendants musterred and bred there. Potted meats. What is home without Plumtree's potted meat? Incomplete. What a stupid ad! Under the obituary notices they stuck it. All up a plumtree. Dignam's potted meat. Cannibals would with lemon and rice. White missionary too salty. Like pickled pork. Expect the chief consumes the parts of honour. Ought to be tough from exercise. His wives in a row to watch the effect. There was a right royal old nigger. Who ate or something the somethings of the reverend Mr MacTrigger. With it an abode of bliss. Lord knows what concoction. Cauls mouldy tripes windpipes faked and minced up. Puzzle find the meat. Kosher. No meat and milk together. Hygiene that was what they call now. Yom Kippur fast spring cleaning of inside. Peace and war depend on some fellow's digestion. Religions. Christmas turkeys and geese. Slaughter of innocents. Eat drink and be merry. Then casual wards full after. Heads bandaged. Cheese digests all but itself. Mity cheese.  \\u2014Have you a cheese sandwich?  \\u2014Yes, sir.  Like a few olives too if they had them. Italian I prefer. Good glass of burgundy take away that. Lubricate. A nice salad, cool as a cucumber, Tom Kernan can dress. Puts gusto into it. Pure olive oil. Milly served me that cutlet with a sprig of parsley. Take one Spanish onion. God made food, the devil the cooks. Devilled crab.  \\u2014Wife well?  \\u2014Quite well, thanks... A cheese sandwich, then. Gorgonzola, have you?  \\u2014Yes, sir.  Nosey Flynn sipped his grog.  \\u2014Doing any singing those times?  Look at his mouth. Could whistle in his own ear. Flap ears to match. Music. Knows as much about it as my coachman. Still better tell him. Does no harm. Free ad.  \\u2014She's engaged for a big tour end of this month. You may have heard perhaps.  \\u2014No. O, that's the style. Who's getting it up?  The curate served.  \\u2014How much is that?  \\u2014Seven d., sir... Thank you, sir.  Mr Bloom cut his sandwich into slender strips. Mr MacTrigger. Easier than the dreamy creamy stuff. His five hundred wives. Had the time of their lives.  \\u2014Mustard, sir?  \\u2014Thank you.  He studded under each lifted strip yellow blobs. Their lives. I have it. It grew bigger and bigger and bigger.  \\u2014Getting it up? he said. Well, it's like a company idea, you see. Part shares and part profits.  \\u2014Ay, now I remember, Nosey Flynn said, putting his hand in his pocket to scratch his groin. Who is this was telling me? Isn't Blazes Boylan mixed up in it?  A warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Bloom's heart. He raised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock. Two. Pub clock five minutes fast. Time going on. Hands moving. Two. Not yet.  His midriff yearned then upward, sank within him, yearned more longly, longingly.  Wine.  He smellsipped the cordial juice and, bidding his throat strongly to speed it, set his wineglass delicately down.  \\u2014Yes, he said. He's the organiser in point of fact.  No fear: no brains.  Nosey Flynn snuffled and scratched. Flea having a good square meal.  \\u2014He had a good slice of luck, Jack Mooney was telling me, over that boxingmatch Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the Portobello barracks. By God, he had the little kipper down in the county Carlow he was telling me...  Hope that dewdrop doesn't come down into his glass. No, snuffled it up.  \\u2014For near a month, man, before it came off. Sucking duck eggs by God till further orders. Keep him off the boose, see? O, by God, Blazes is a hairy chap.  Davy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves, cleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin. Herring's blush. Whose smile upon each feature plays with such and such replete. Too much fat on the parsnips.  \\u2014And here's himself and pepper on him, Nosey Flynn said. Can you give us a good one for the Gold cup?  \\u2014I'm off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered. I never put anything on a horse.  \\u2014You're right there, Nosey Flynn said.  Mr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of disgust pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese. Sips of his wine soothed his palate. Not logwood that. Tastes fuller this weather with the chill off.  Nice quiet bar. Nice piece of wood in that counter. Nicely planed. Like the way it curves there.  \\u2014I wouldn't do anything at all in that line, Davy Byrne said. It ruined many a man, the same horses.  Vintners' sweepstake. Licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises. Heads I win tails you lose.  \\u2014True for you, Nosey Flynn said. Unless you're in the know. There's no straight sport going now. Lenehan gets some good ones. He's giving Sceptre today. Zinfandel's the favourite, lord Howard de Walden's, won at Epsom. Morny Cannon is riding him. I could have got seven to one against Saint Amant a fortnight before.  \\u2014That so? Davy Byrne said...  He went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned its pages.  \\u2014I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. That was a rare bit of horseflesh. Saint Frusquin was her sire. She won in a thunderstorm, Rothschild's filly, with wadding in her ears. Blue jacket and yellow cap. Bad luck to big Ben Dollard and his John O'Gaunt. He put me off it. Ay.  He drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the flutes.  \\u2014Ay, he said, sighing.  Mr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh. Nosey numbskull. Will I tell him that horse Lenehan? He knows already. Better let him forget. Go and lose more. Fool and his money. Dewdrop coming down again. Cold nose he'd have kissing a woman. Still they might like. Prickly beards they like. Dogs' cold noses. Old Mrs Riordan with the rumbling stomach's Skye terrier in the City Arms hotel. Molly fondling him in her lap. O, the big doggybowwowsywowsy!  Wine soaked and softened rolled pith of bread mustard a moment mawkish cheese. Nice wine it is. Taste it better because I'm not thirsty. Bath of course does that. Just a bite or two. Then about six o'clock I can. Six. Six. Time will be gone then. She...  Mild fire of wine kindled his veins. I wanted that badly. Felt so off colour. His eyes unhungrily saw shelves of tins: sardines, gaudy lobsters' claws. All the odd things people pick up for food. Out of shells, periwinkles with a pin, off trees, snails out of the ground the French eat, out of the sea with bait on a hook. Silly fish learn nothing in a thousand years. If you didn't know risky putting anything into your mouth. Poisonous berries. Johnny Magories. Roundness you think good. Gaudy colour warns you off. One fellow told another and so on. Try it on the dog first. Led on by the smell or the look. Tempting fruit. Ice cones. Cream. Instinct. Orangegroves for instance. Need artificial irrigation. Bleibtreustrasse. Yes but what about oysters. Unsightly like a clot of phlegm. Filthy shells. Devil to open them too. Who found them out? Garbage, sewage they feed on. Fizz and Red bank oysters. Effect on the sexual. Aphrodis. He was in the Red Bank this morning. Was he oysters old fish at table perhaps he young flesh in bed no June has no ar no oysters. But there are people like things high. Tainted game. Jugged hare. First catch your hare. Chinese eating eggs fifty years old, blue and green again. Dinner of thirty courses. Each dish harmless might mix inside. Idea for a poison mystery. That archduke Leopold was it no yes or was it Otto one of those Habsburgs? Or who was it used to eat the scruff off his own head? Cheapest lunch in town. Of course aristocrats, then the others copy to be in the fashion. Milly too rock oil and flour. Raw pastry I like myself. Half the catch of oysters they throw back in the sea to keep up the price. Cheap no-one would buy. Caviare. Do the grand. Hock in green glasses. Swell blowout. Lady this. Powdered bosom pearls. The \\u00e9lite. Cr\\u00e8me de la cr\\u00e8me. They want special dishes to pretend they're. Hermit with a platter of pulse keep down the stings of the flesh. Know me come eat with me. Royal sturgeon high sheriff, Coffey, the butcher, right to venisons of the forest from his ex. Send him back the half of a cow. Spread I saw down in the Master of the Rolls' kitchen area. Whitehatted chef like a rabbi. Combustible duck. Curly cabbage \\u00e0 la duchesse de Parme. Just as well to write it on the bill of fare so you can know what you've eaten. Too many drugs spoil the broth. I know it myself. Dosing it with Edwards' desiccated soup. Geese stuffed silly for them. Lobsters boiled alive. Do ptake some ptarmigan. Wouldn't mind being a waiter in a swell hotel. Tips, evening dress, halfnaked ladies. May I tempt you to a little more filleted lemon sole, miss Dubedat? Yes, do bedad. And she did bedad. Huguenot name I expect that. A miss Dubedat lived in Killiney, I remember. Du, de la French. Still it's the same fish perhaps old Micky Hanlon of Moore street ripped the guts out of making money hand over fist finger in fishes' gills can't write his name on a cheque think he was painting the landscape with his mouth twisted. Moooikill A Aitcha Ha ignorant as a kish of brogues, worth fifty thousand pounds.  Stuck on the pane two flies buzzed, stuck.  Glowing wine on his palate lingered swallowed. Crushing in the winepress grapes of Burgundy. Sun's heat it is. Seems to a secret touch telling me memory. Touched his sense moistened remembered. Hidden under wild ferns on Howth below us bay sleeping: sky. No sound. The sky. The bay purple by the Lion's head. Green by Drumleck. Yellowgreen towards Sutton. Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities. Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather scrub my hand under her nape, you'll toss me all. O wonder! Coolsoft with ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn away. Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth. Yum. Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and chewed. Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle. Joy: I ate it: joy. Young life, her lips that gave me pouting. Soft warm sticky gumjelly lips. Flowers her eyes were, take me, willing eyes. Pebbles fell. She lay still. A goat. No-one. High on Ben Howth rhododendrons a nannygoat walking surefooted, dropping currants. Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded. Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman's breasts full in her blouse of nun's veiling, fat nipples upright. Hot I tongued her. She kissed me. I was kissed. All yielding she tossed my hair. Kissed, she kissed me.  Me. And me now.  Stuck, the flies buzzed.  His downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab. Beauty: it curves: curves are beauty. Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno: curves the world admires. Can see them library museum standing in the round hall, naked goddesses. Aids to digestion. They don't care what man looks. All to see. Never speaking. I mean to say to fellows like Flynn. Suppose she did Pygmalion and Galatea what would she say first? Mortal! Put you in your proper place. Quaffing nectar at mess with gods golden dishes, all ambrosial. Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled mutton, carrots and turnips, bottle of Allsop. Nectar imagine it drinking electricity: gods' food. Lovely forms of women sculped Junonian. Immortal lovely. And we stuffing food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like stoking an engine. They have no. Never looked. I'll look today. Keeper won't see. Bend down let something drop see if she.  Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do there to do. A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.  When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book:  \\u2014What is this he is? Isn't he in the insurance line?  \\u2014He's out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. He does canvassing for the Freeman.  \\u2014I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. Is he in trouble?  \\u2014Trouble? Nosey Flynn said. Not that I heard of. Why?  \\u2014I noticed he was in mourning.  \\u2014Was he? Nosey Flynn said. So he was, faith. I asked him how was all at home. You're right, by God. So he was.  \\u2014I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a gentleman is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their minds.  \\u2014It's not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. I met him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan's wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half. She's well nourished, I tell you. Plovers on toast.  \\u2014And is he doing for the Freeman? Davy Byrne said.  Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.  \\u2014-He doesn't buy cream on the ads he picks up. You can make bacon of that.  \\u2014How so? Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.  Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers. He winked.  \\u2014He's in the craft, he said.  \\u2014-Do you tell me so? Davy Byrne said.  \\u2014Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. Ancient free and accepted order. He's an excellent brother. Light, life and love, by God. They give him a leg up. I was told that by a\\u2014well, I won't say who.  \\u2014Is that a fact?  \\u2014O, it's a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. They stick to you when you're down. I know a fellow was trying to get into it. But they're as close as damn it. By God they did right to keep the women out of it.  Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:  \\u2014Iiiiiichaaaaaaach!  \\u2014There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing. But be damned but they smelt her out and swore her in on the spot a master mason. That was one of the saint Legers of Doneraile.  Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:  \\u2014And is that a fact? Decent quiet man he is. I often saw him in here and I never once saw him\\u2014you know, over the line.  \\u2014God Almighty couldn't make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly. Slips off when the fun gets too hot. Didn't you see him look at his watch? Ah, you weren't there. If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. Declare to God he does.  \\u2014There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. He's a safe man, I'd say.  \\u2014He's not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up. He's been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow. Give the devil his due. O, Bloom has his good points. But there's one thing he'll never do.  His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.  \\u2014I know, Davy Byrne said.  \\u2014Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.  Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in. Tom Rochford followed frowning, a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.  \\u2014Day, Mr Byrne.  \\u2014Day, gentlemen.  They paused at the counter.  \\u2014Who's standing? Paddy Leonard asked.  \\u2014I'm sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.  \\u2014Well, what'll it be? Paddy Leonard asked.  \\u2014I'll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.  \\u2014How much? Paddy Leonard cried. Since when, for God' sake? What's yours, Tom?  \\u2014How is the main drainage? Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.  For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped.  \\u2014Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said.  \\u2014Certainly, sir.  Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.  \\u2014Lord love a duck, he said. Look at what I'm standing drinks to! Cold water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg. He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup. A dead snip.  \\u2014Zinfandel is it? Nosey Flynn asked.  Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him.  \\u2014That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.  \\u2014Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.  Tom Rochford nodded and drank.  \\u2014Is it Zinfandel?  \\u2014Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked. I'm going to plunge five bob on my own.  \\u2014Tell us if you're worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard said. Who gave it to you?  Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.  \\u2014So long! Nosey Flynn said.  The others turned.  \\u2014That's the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.  \\u2014Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn. Mr Byrne, sir, we'll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a...  \\u2014Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.  \\u2014Ay, Paddy Leonard said. A suckingbottle for the baby.  Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth smooth. Something green it would have to be: spinach, say. Then with those Rontgen rays searchlight you could.  At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the cobblestones and lapped it with new zest. Surfeit. Returned with thanks having fully digested the contents. First sweet then savoury. Mr Bloom coasted warily. Ruminants. His second course. Their upper jaw they move. Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his? Wasting time explaining it to Flynn's mouth. Lean people long mouths. Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free. Course then you'd have all the cranks pestering.  He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars:  Don Giovanni, a cenar teco M'invitasti.  Feel better. Burgundy. Good pick me up. Who distilled first? Some chap in the blues. Dutch courage. That Kilkenny People in the national library now I must.  Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber, turned back his thoughts. They could: and watch it all the way down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines like pipes. But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show. Science.  \\u2014A cenar teco.  What does that teco mean? Tonight perhaps.  Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited To come to supper tonight, The rum the rumdum.  Doesn't go properly.  Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to. That'll be two pounds ten about two pounds eight. Three Hynes owes me. Two eleven. Prescott's dyeworks van over there. If I get Billy Prescott's ad: two fifteen. Five guineas about. On the pig's back.  Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new garters.  Today. Today. Not think.  Tour the south then. What about English wateringplaces? Brighton, Margate. Piers by moonlight. Her voice floating out. Those lovely seaside girls. Against John Long's a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle. Handy man wants job. Small wages. Will eat anything.  Mr Bloom turned at Gray's confectioner's window of unbought tarts and passed the reverend Thomas Connellan's bookstore. Why I left the church of Rome? Birds' Nest. Women run him. They say they used to give pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight. Society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor jews. Same bait. Why we left the church of Rome.  A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. No tram in sight. Wants to cross.  \\u2014Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.  The blind stripling did not answer. His wallface frowned weakly. He moved his head uncertainly.  \\u2014You're in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth street is opposite. Do you want to cross? There's nothing in the way.  The cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Bloom's eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks' van drawn up before Drago's. Where I saw his brillantined hair just when I was. Horse drooping. Driver in John Long's. Slaking his drouth.  \\u2014There's a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it's not moving. I'll see you across. Do you want to go to Molesworth street?  \\u2014Yes, the stripling answered. South Frederick street.  \\u2014Come, Mr Bloom said.  He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward.  Say something to him. Better not do the condescending. They mistrust what you tell them. Pass a common remark.  \\u2014The rain kept off.  No answer.  Stains on his coat. Slobbers his food, I suppose. Tastes all different for him. Have to be spoonfed first. Like a child's hand, his hand. Like Milly's was. Sensitive. Sizing me up I daresay from my hand. Wonder if he has a name. Van. Keep his cane clear of the horse's legs: tired drudge get his doze. That's right. Clear. Behind a bull: in front of a horse.  \\u2014Thanks, sir.  Knows I'm a man. Voice.  \\u2014Right now? First turn to the left.  The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again.  Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed. Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there? Must have felt it. See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense of volume. Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark. Wonder would he feel it if something was removed. Feel a gap. Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones. Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn't that cane? Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest.  Penrose! That was that chap's name.  Look at all the things they can learn to do. Read with their fingers. Tune pianos. Or we are surprised they have any brains. Why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say. Of course the other senses are more. Embroider. Plait baskets. People ought to help. Workbasket I could buy for Molly's birthday. Hates sewing. Might take an objection. Dark men they call them.  Sense of smell must be stronger too. Smells on all sides, bunched together. Each street different smell. Each person too. Then the spring, the summer: smells. Tastes? They say you can't taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head. Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.  And with a woman, for instance. More shameless not seeing. That girl passing the Stewart institution, head in the air. Look at me. I have them all on. Must be strange not to see her. Kind of a form in his mind's eye.

Walking by Doran's publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of his belly. But I know it's whitey yellow.

To live in, Combray was a trifle depressing, like its streets, whose houses, built of the blackened stone of the country, fronted with outside steps, capped with gables which projected long shadows downwards, were so dark that one had, as soon as the sun began to go down, to draw back the curtains in the sitting-room windows; streets with the solemn names of Saints, not a few of whom figured in the history of the early lords of Combray, such as the Rue Saint-Hilaire, the Rue Saint-Jacques, in which my aunt\\\\'s house stood, the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde, which ran past her railings, and the Rue du Saint-Esprit, on to which the little garden gate opened; and these Combray streets exist in so remote a quarter of my memory, painted in colours so different from those in which the world is decked for me to-day, that in fact one and all of them, and the church which towered above them in the Square, seem to me now more unsubstantial than the projections of my magic-lantern; while at times I feel that to be able to cross the Rue Saint-Hilaire again, to engage a room in the Rue de l\\\\'Oiseau, in the old hostelry of the Oiseau Flesch\\u00e9, from whose windows in the pavement used to rise a smell of cooking which rises still in my mind, now and then, in the same warm gusts of comfort, would be to secure a contact with the unseen world more marvellously supernatural than it would be to make Golo\\\\'s acquaintance and to chat with Genevi\\u00e8ve de Brabant.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0My grandfather\\\\'s cousin\\u2014by courtesy my great-aunt\\u2014with whom we used to stay, was the mother of that aunt L\\u00e9onie who, since her husband\\\\'s my uncle Octave\\\\'s death, had gradually declined to leave, first Combray, then her house in Combray, then her bedroom, and finally her bed; and who now never \\\\'came down,\\\\' but lay perpetually in an indefinite condition of grief, physical exhaustion, illness, obsessions, and religious observances. Her own room looked out over the Rue Saint-Jacques, which ran a long way further to end in the Grand-Pr\\u00e9 as distinct from the Petit-Pr\\u00e9, a green space in the centre of the town where three streets met and which, monotonous and grey, with the three high steps of stone before almost every one of its doors, seemed like a deep furrow cut by some sculptor of gothic images in the very block of stone out of which he had fashioned a Calvary or a Crib. My aunt\\\\'s life was now practically confined to two adjoining rooms, in one of which she would rest in the afternoon while they, aired the other. They were rooms of that country order which just as in certain climes whole tracts of air or ocean are illuminated or scented by myriads of protozoa which we cannot see fascinate our sense of smell with the countless odours springing from their own special virtues, wisdom, habits, a whole secret system of life, invisible, superabundant and profoundly moral, which their atmosphere holds in solution; smells natural enough indeed, and coloured by circumstances as are those of the neighbouring countryside, but already humanised, domesticated, confined, an exquisite, skilful, limpid jelly, blending all the fruits of the season which have left the orchard for the store-room, smells changing with the year, but plenishing, domestic smells, which compensate for the sharpness of hoar frost with the sweet savour of warm bread, smells lazy and punctual as a village clock, roving smells, pious smells; rejoicing in a peace which brings only an increase of anxiety, and in a prosiness which serves as a deep source of poetry to the stranger who passes through their midst without having lived amongst them. The air of those rooms was saturated with the fine bouquet of a silence so nourishing, so succulent that I could not enter them without a sort of greedy enjoyment, particularly on those first mornings, chilly still, of the Easter holidays, when I could taste it more fully, because I had just arrived then at Combray: before I went in to wish my aunt good day I would be kept waiting a little time in the outer room, where the sun, a wintry sun still, had crept in to warm itself before the fire, lighted already between its two brick sides and plastering all the room and everything in it with a smell of soot, making the room like one of those great open hearths which one finds in the country, or one of the canopied mantelpieces in old castles under which one sits hoping that in the world outside it is raining or snowing, hoping almost for a catastrophic deluge to add the romance of shelter and security to the comfort of a snug retreat; I would turn to and fro between the prayer-desk and the stamped velvet armchairs, each one always draped in its crocheted antimacassar, while the fire, baking like a pie the appetising smells with which the air of the room, was thickly clotted, which the dewy and sunny freshness of the morning had already \\\\'raised\\\\' and started to \\\\'set,\\\\' puffed them and glazed them and fluted them and swelled them into an invisible though not impalpable country cake, an immense puff-pastry, in which, barely waiting to savour the crustier, more delicate, more respectable, but also drier smells of the cupboard, the chest-of-drawers, and the patterned wall-paper I always returned with an unconfessed gluttony to bury myself in the nondescript, resinous, dull, indigestible, and fruity smell of the flowered quilt.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0In the next room I could hear my aunt talking quietly to herself. She never spoke save in low tones, because she believed that there was something broken in her head and floating loose there, which she might displace by talking too loud; but she never remained for long, even when alone, without saying something, because she believed that it was good for her throat, and that by keeping the blood there in circulation it would make less frequent the chokings and other pains to which she was liable; besides, in the life of complete inertia which she led she attached to the least of her sensations an extraordinary importance, endowed them with a Protean ubiquity which made it difficult for her to keep them secret, and, failing a confidant to whom she might communicate them, she used to promulgate them to herself in an unceasing monologue which was her sole form of activity. Unfortunately, having formed the habit of thinking aloud, she did not always take care to see that there was no one in the adjoining room, and I would often hear her saying to herself: \\\"I must not forget that I never slept a wink\\\"\\u2014for \\\"never sleeping a wink\\\" was her great claim to distinction, and one admitted and respected in our household vocabulary; in the morning Fran\\u00e7oise would not \\\\'call\\\\' her, but would simply \\\\'come to\\\\' her; during the day, when my aunt wished to take a nap, we used to say just that she wished to \\\\'be quiet\\\\' or to \\\\'rest\\\\'; and when in conversation she so far forgot herself as to say \\\"what made me wake up,\\\" or \\\"I dreamed that,\\\" she would flush and at once correct herself.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0After waiting a minute, I would go in and kiss her; Fran\\u00e7oise would be making her tea; or, if my aunt were feeling \\\\'upset,\\\\' she would ask instead for her \\\\'tisane,\\\\' and it would be my duty to shake out of the chemist\\\\'s little package on to a plate the amount of lime-blossom required for infusion in boiling water. The drying of the stems had twisted them into a fantastic trellis, in whose intervals the pale flowers opened, as though a painter had arranged them there, grouping them in the most decorative poses. The leaves, which had lost or altered their own appearance, assumed those instead of the most incongruous things imaginable, as though the transparent wings of flies or the blank sides of labels or the petals of roses had been collected and pounded, or interwoven as birds weave the material for their nests. A thousand trifling little details\\u2014the charming prodigality of the chemist\\u2014details which would have been eliminated from an artificial preparation, gave me, like a book in which one is astonished to read the name of a person whom one knows, the pleasure of finding that these were indeed real lime-blossoms, like those I had seen, when coming from the train, in the Avenue de la Gare, altered, but only because they were not imitations but the very same blossoms, which had grown old. And as each new character is merely a metamorphosis from something older, in these little grey balls I recognised green buds plucked before their time; but beyond all else the rosy, moony, tender glow which lit up the blossoms among the frail forest of stems from which they hung like little golden roses\\u2014marking, as the radiance upon an old wall still marks the place of a vanished fresco, the difference between those parts of the tree which had and those which had not been \\\\'in bloom\\\\'\\u2014shewed me that these were petals which, before their flowering-time, the chemist\\\\'s package had embalmed on warm evenings of spring. That rosy candlelight was still their colour, but half-extinguished and deadened in the diminished life which was now theirs, and which may be called the twilight of a flower. Presently my aunt was able to dip in the boiling infusion, in which she would relish the savour of dead or faded blossom, a little madeleine, of which she would hold out a piece to me when it was sufficiently soft.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0At one side of her bed stood a big yellow chest-of-drawers of lemon-wood, and a table which served at once as pharmacy and as high altar, on which, beneath a statue of Our Lady and a bottle of Vichy-C\\u00e9lestins, might be found her service-books and her medical prescriptions, everything that she needed for the performance, in bed, of her duties to soul and body, to keep the proper times for pepsin and for vespers. On the other side her bed was bounded by the window: she had the street beneath her eyes, and would read in it from morning to night to divert the tedium of her life, like a Persian prince, the daily but immemorial chronicles of Combray, which she would discuss in detail afterwards with Fran\\u00e7oise. \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0I would not have been five minutes with my aunt before she would send me away in case I made her tired. She would hold out for me to kiss her sad brow, pale and lifeless, on which at this early hour she would not yet have arranged the false hair and through which the bones shone like the points of a crown of thorns\\u2014or the beads of a rosary, and she would say to me: \\\"Now, my poor child, you must go away; go and get ready for mass; and if you see Fran\\u00e7oise downstairs, tell her not to stay too long amusing herself with you; she must come up soon to see if I want anything.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Fran\\u00e7oise, who had been for many years in my aunt\\\\'s service and did not at that time suspect that she would one day be transferred entirely to ours, was a little inclined to desert my aunt during the months which we spent in her house. There had been in my infancy, before we first went to Combray, and when my aunt L\\u00e9onie used still to spend the winter in Paris with her mother, a time when I knew Fran\\u00e7oise so little that on New Year\\\\'s Day, before going into my great-aunt\\\\'s house, my mother put a five-franc piece in my hand and said: \\\"Now, be careful. Don\\\\'t make any mistake. Wait until you hear me say \\\\'Good morning, Fran\\u00e7oise,\\\\' and I touch your arm before you give it to her.\\\" No sooner had we arrived in my aunt\\\\'s dark hall than we saw in the gloom, beneath the frills of a snowy cap as stiff and fragile as if it had been made of spun sugar, the concentric waves of a smile of anticipatory gratitude. It was Fran\\u00e7oise, motionless and erect, framed in the small doorway of the corridor like the statue of a saint in its niche. When we had grown more accustomed to this religious darkness we could discern in her features a disinterested love of all humanity, blended with a tender respect for the \\\\'upper classes\\\\' which raised to the most honourable quarter of her heart the hope of receiving her due reward. Mamma pinched my arm sharply and said in a loud voice: \\\"Good morning, Fran\\u00e7oise.\\\" At this signal my fingers parted and I let fall the coin, which found a receptacle in a confused but outstretched hand. But since we had begun to go to Combray there was no one I knew better than Fran\\u00e7oise. We were her favourites, and in the first years at least, while she shewed the same consideration for us as for my aunt, she enjoyed us with a keener relish, because we had, in addition to our dignity as part of \\\\'the family\\\\' for she had for those invisible bonds by which community of blood unites the members of a family as much respect as any Greek tragedian, the fresh charm of not being her customary employers. And so with what joy would she welcome us, with what sorrow complain that the weather was still so bad for us, on the day of our arrival, just before Easter, when there was often an icy wind; while Mamma inquired after her daughter and her nephews, and if her grandson was good-looking, and what they were going to make of him, and whether he took after his granny.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Later, when no one else was in the room, Mamma, who knew that Fran\\u00e7oise was still mourning for her parents, who had been dead for years, would speak of them kindly, asking her endless little questions about them and their lives.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0She had guessed that Fran\\u00e7oise was not over-fond of her son-in-law, and that he spoiled the pleasure she found in visiting her daughter, as the two could not talk so freely when he was there. And so one day, when Fran\\u00e7oise was going to their house, some miles from Combray, Mamma said to her, with a smile: \\\"Tell me, Fran\\u00e7oise, if Julien has had to go away, and you have Marguerite to yourself all day, you will be very sorry, but will make the best of it, won\\\\'t you?\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And Fran\\u00e7oise answered, laughing: \\\"Madame knows everything; Madame is worse than the X-rays\\\" she pronounced \\\\'x\\\\' with an affectation of difficulty and with a smile in deprecation of her, an unlettered woman\\\\'s, daring to employ a scientific term \\\"they brought here for Mme. Octave, which see what is in your heart\\\"\\u2014and she went off, disturbed that anyone should be caring about her, perhaps anxious that we should not see her in tears: Mamma was the first person who had given her the pleasure of feeling that her peasant existence, with its simple joys and sorrows, might offer some interest, might be a source of grief or pleasure to some one other than herself.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0My aunt resigned herself to doing without Fran\\u00e7oise to some extent during our visits, knowing how much my mother appreciated the services of so active and intelligent a maid, one who looked as smart at five o\\\\'clock in the morning in her kitchen, under a cap whose stiff and dazzling frills seemed to be made of porcelain, as when dressed for churchgoing; who did everything in the right way, who toiled like a horse, whether she was well or ill, but without noise, without the appearance of doing anything; the only one of my aunt\\\\'s maids who when Mamma asked for hot water or black coffee would bring them actually boiling; she was one of those servants who in a household seem least satisfactory, at first, to a stranger, doubtless because they take no pains to make a conquest of him and shew him no special attention, knowing very well that they have no real need of him, that he will cease to be invited to the house sooner than they will be dismissed from it; who, on the other hand, cling with most fidelity to those masters and mistresses who have tested and proved their real capacity, and do not look for that superficial responsiveness, that slavish affability, which may impress a stranger favourably, but often conceals an utter barrenness of spirit in which no amount of training can produce the least trace of individuality.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0When Fran\\u00e7oise, having seen that my parents had everything they required, first went upstairs again to give my aunt her pepsin and to find out from her what she would take for luncheon, very few mornings pased but she was called upon to give an opinion, or to furnish an explanation, in regard to some important event.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Just fancy, Fran\\u00e7oise, Mme. Goupil went by more than a quarter of an hour late to fetch her sister: if she loses any more time on the way I should not be at all surprised if she got in after the Elevation.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Well, there\\\\'d be nothing wonderful in that,\\\" would be the answer. Or:  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Fran\\u00e7oise, if you had come in five minutes ago, you would have seen Mme. Imbert go past with some asparagus twice the size of what mother Callot has: do try to find out from her cook where she got them. You know you\\\\'ve been putting asparagus in all your sauces this spring; you might be able to get some like these for our visitors.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"I shouldn\\\\'t be surprised if they came from the Cur\\u00e9\\\\'s,\\\" Fran\\u00e7oise would say, and:  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"I\\\\'m sure you wouldn\\\\'t, my poor Fran\\u00e7oise,\\\" my aunt would reply, raising her shoulders. \\\"From the Cur\\u00e9\\\\'s, indeed! You know quite well that he can never grow anything but wretched little twigs of asparagus, not asparagus at all. I tell you these ones were as thick as my arm. Not your arm, of course, but my-poor arm, which has grown so much thinner again this year.\\\" Or:   \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Fran\\u00e7oise, didn\\\\'t you hear that bell just now! It split my head.\\\" \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"No, Mme. Octave.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Ah, poor girl, your skull must be very thick; you may thank God for that. It was Maguelone come to fetch Dr. Piperaud. He came out with her at once and they went off along the Rue de l\\\\'Oiseau. There must be some child ill.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Oh dear, dear; the poor little creature!\\\" would come with a sigh from Fran\\u00e7oise, who could not hear of any calamity befalling a person unknown to her, even in some distant part of the world, without beginning to lament. Or:  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Fran\\u00e7oise, for whom did they toll the passing-bell just now? Oh dear, of course, it would be for Mme. Rousseau. And to think that I had forgotten that she passed away the other night. Indeed, it is time the Lord called me home too; I don\\\\'t know what has become of my head since I lost my poor Octave. But I am wasting your time, my good girl.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Indeed no, Mme. Octave, my time is not so precious; whoever made our time didn\\\\'t sell it to us. I am just going to see that my fire hasn\\\\'t gone out.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0In this way Fran\\u00e7oise and my aunt made a critical valuation between them, in the course of these morning sessions, of the earliest happenings of the day. But sometimes these happenings assumed so mysterious or so alarming an air that my aunt felt she could not wait until it was time for Fran\\u00e7oise to come upstairs, and then a formidable and quadruple peal would resound through the house.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"But, Mme. Octave, it is not time for your pepsin,\\\" Fran\\u00e7oise would begin. \\\"Are you feeling faint?\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"No, thank you, Fran\\u00e7oise,\\\" my aunt would reply, \\\"that is to say, yes; for you know well that there is very seldom a time when I don\\\\'t feel faint; one day I shall pass away like Mme. Rousseau, before I know where I am; but that is not why I rang. Would you believe that I have just seen, as plainly as I see you, Mme. Goupil with a little girl I didn\\\\'t know at all. Run and get a pennyworth of salt from Camus. It\\\\'s not often that Th\\u00e9odore can\\\\'t tell you who a person is.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"But that must be M. Pupin\\\\'s daughter,\\\" Fran\\u00e7oise would say, preferring to stick to an immediate explanation, since she had been perhaps twice already into Camus\\\\'s shop that morning.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"M. Pupin\\\\'s daughter! Oh, that\\\\'s a likely story, my poor Fran\\u00e7oise. Do you think I should not have recognised M. Pupin\\\\'s daughter!\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"But I don\\\\'t mean the big one, Mme. Octave; I mean the little girl, he one who goes to school at Jouy. I seem to have seen her once already his morning.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Oh, if that\\\\'s what it is!\\\" my aunt would say, \\\"she must have come over for the holidays. Yes, that is it. No need to ask, she will have come over for the holidays. But then we shall soon see Mme. Sazerat come along and ring her sister\\\\'s door-bell, for her luncheon. That will be it! I saw the boy from Galopin\\\\'s go by with a tart. You will see that the tart was for Mme. Goupil.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Once Mme. Goupil has anyone in the house, Mme. Octave, you won\\\\'t be long in seeing all her folk going in to their luncheon there, for it\\\\'s not so early as it was,\\\" would be the answer, for Fran\\u00e7oise, who was anxious to retire downstairs to look after our own meal, was not sorry to leave my aunt with the prospect of such a distraction. \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Oh! not before midday!\\\" my aunt would reply in a tone of resignation, darting an uneasy glance at the clock, but stealthily, so as not to let it be seen that she, who had renounced all earthly joys, yet found a keen satisfaction in learning that Mme. Goupil was expecting company to luncheon, though, alas, she must wait a little more than an hour still before enjoying the spectacle. \\\"And it will come in the middle of my luncheon!\\\" she would murmur to herself. Her luncheon was such a distraction in itself that she did not like any other to come at the same time. \\\"At least, you will not forget to give me my creamed eggs on one of the flat plates?\\\" These were the only plates which had pictures on them and my aunt used to amuse herself at every meal by reading the description on whichever might have been sent up to her. She would put on her spectacles and spell out: \\\"Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,\\\" \\\"Aladdin, or the Wonderful Lamp,\\\" and smile, and say \\\"Very good indeed.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"I may as well go across to Camus...\\\" Fran\\u00e7oise would hazard, seeing that my aunt had no longer any intention of sending her there.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"No, no; it\\\\'s not worth while now; it\\\\'s certain to be the Pupin girl. My poor Fran\\u00e7oise, I am sorry to have made you come upstairs for nothing.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0But it was not for nothing, as my aunt well knew, that she had rung for Fran\\u00e7oise, since at Combray a person whom one \\\\'didn\\\\'t know at all\\\\' was as incredible a being as any mythological deity, and it was apt to be forgotten that after each occasion on which there had appeared in the Rue du Saint-Esprit or in the Square one of these bewildering phenomena, careful and exhaustive researches had invariably reduced the fabulous monster to the proportions of a person whom one \\\\'did know,\\\\' either personally or in the abstract, in his or her civil status as being more or less closely related to some family in Combray. It would turn out to be Mme. Sauton\\\\'s son discharged from the army, or the Abb\\u00e9 Perdreau\\\\'s niece come home from her convent, or the Cur\\u00e9\\\\'s brother, a tax-collector at Ch\\u00e2teaudun, who had just retired on a pension or had come over to Combray for the holidays. On first noticing them you have been impressed by the thought that there might be in Combray people whom you \\\\'didn\\\\'t know at all,\\\\' simply because, you had failed to recognise or identify them at once. And yet long beforehand Mme. Sauton and the Cur\\u00e9 had given warning that they expected their \\\\'strangers.\\\\' In the evening, when I came in and went upstairs to tell my aunt the incidents of our walk, if I was rash enough to say to her that we had passed, near the Pont-Vieux, a man whom my grandfather didn\\\\'t know:  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"A man grandfather didn\\\\'t know at all!\\\" she would exclaim. \\\"That\\\\'s a likely story.\\\" None the less, she would be a little disturbed by the news, she would wish to have the details correctly, and so my grandfather would be summoned. \\\"Who can it have been that you passed near the Pont-Vieux, uncle? A man you didn\\\\'t know at all?\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Why, of course I did,\\\" my grandfather would answer; \\\"it was Prosper, Mme. Bouilleboeuf\\\\'s gardener\\\\'s brother.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Ah, well!\\\" my aunt would say, calm again but slightly flushed still; \\\"and the boy told me that you had passed a man you didn\\\\'t know at all!\\\" After which I would be warned to be more careful of what I said, and not to upset my aunt so by thoughtless remarks. Everyone was so well known in Combray, animals as well as people, that if my aunt had happened to see a dog go by which she \\\\'didn\\\\'t know at all\\\\' she would think about it incessantly, devoting to the solution of the incomprehensible problem all her inductive talent and her leisure hours.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"That will be Mme. Sazerat\\\\'s dog,\\\" Fran\\u00e7oise would suggest, without any real conviction, but in the hope of peace, and so that my aunt should not \\\\'split her head.\\\\'  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"As if I didn\\\\'t know Mme. Sazerat\\\\'s dog!\\\"\\u2014for my aunt\\\\'s critical mind would not so easily admit any fresh fact.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Ah, but that will be the new dog M. Galopin has brought her from Lisieux.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Oh, if that\\\\'s what it is!\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"It seems, it\\\\'s a most engaging animal,\\\" Fran\\u00e7oise would go on, having got the story from Th\\u00e9odore, \\\"as clever as a Christian, always in a good temper, always friendly, always everything that\\\\'s nice. It\\\\'s not often you see an animal so well-behaved at that age. Mme. Octave, it\\\\'s high time I left you; I can\\\\'t afford to stay here amusing myself; look, it\\\\'s nearly ten o\\\\'clock and my fire not lighted yet, and I\\\\'ve still to dress the asparagus.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"What, Fran\\u00e7oise, more asparagus! It\\\\'s a regular disease of asparagus you have got this year: you will make our Parisians sick of it.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"No, no, Madame Octave, they like it well enough. They\\\\'ll be coming back from church soon as hungry as hunters, and they won\\\\'t eat it out of the back of their spoons, you\\\\'ll see.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Church! why, they must be there now; you\\\\'d better not lose any time. Go and look after your luncheon.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0While my aunt gossiped on in this way with Fran\\u00e7oise I would have accompanied my parents to mass. How I loved it: how clearly I can see it still, our church at Combray! The old porch by which we went in, black, and full of holes as a cullender, was worn out of shape and deeply furrowed at the sides as also was the holy water stoup to which it led us just as if the gentle grazing touch of the cloaks of peasant-women going into the church, and of their fingers dipping into the water, had managed by agelong repetition to acquire a destructive force, to impress itself on the stone, to carve ruts in it like those made by cart-wheels upon stone gate-posts against which they are driven every day. Its memorial stones, beneath which the noble dust of the Abbots of Combray, who were buried there, furnished the choir with a sort of spiritual pavement, were themselves no longer hard and lifeless matter, for time had softened and sweetened them, and had made them melt like honey and flow beyond their proper margins, either surging out in a milky, frothing wave, washing from its place a florid gothic capital, drowning the white violets of the marble floor; or else reabsorbed into their limits, contracting still further a crabbed Latin inscription, bringing a fresh touch of fantasy into the arrangement of its curtailed characters, closing together two letters of some word of which the rest were disproportionately scattered. Its windows were never so brilliant as on days when the sun scarcely shone, so that if it was dull outside you might be certain of fine weather in church. One of them was filled from top to bottom by a solitary figure, like the king on a playing-card, who lived up there beneath his canopy of stone, between earth and heaven; and in the blue light of its slanting shadow, on weekdays sometimes, at noon, when there was no service at one of those rare moments when the airy, empty church, more human somehow and more luxurious with the sun shewing off all its rich furnishings, seemed to have almost a habitable air, like the hall\\u2014all sculptured stone and painted glass\\u2014of some mediaeval mansion, you might see Mme. Sazerat kneel for an instant, laying down on the chair beside her own a neatly corded parcel of little cakes which she had just bought at the baker\\\\'s and was taking home for her luncheon. In another, a mountain of rosy snow, at whose foot a battle was being fought, seemed to have frozen the window also, which it swelled and distorted with its cloudy sleet, like a pane to which snowflakes have drifted and clung, but flakes illumined by a sunrise\\u2014the same, doubtless, which purpled the reredos of the altar with tints so fresh that they seemed rather to be thrown on it for a moment by a light shining from outside and shortly to be extinguished than painted and permanently fastened on the stone. And all of them were so old that you could see, here and there, their silvery antiquity sparkling with the dust of centuries and shewing in its threadbare brilliance the very cords of their lovely tapestry of glass. There was one among them which was a tall panel composed of a hundred little rectangular windows, of blue principally, like a great game of patience of the kind planned to beguile King Charles VI; but, either because a ray of sunlight had gleamed through it or because my own shifting vision had drawn across the window, whose colours died away and were rekindled by turns, a rare and transient fire\\u2014the next instant it had taken on all the iridescence of a peacock\\\\'s tail, then shook and wavered in a flaming and fantastic shower, distilled and dropping from the groin of the dark and rocky vault down the moist walls, as though it were along the bed of some rainbow grotto of sinuous stalactites that I was following my parents, who marched before me, their prayer-books clasped in their hands; a moment later the little lozenge windows had put on the deep transparence, the unbreakable hardness of sapphires clustered on some enormous breastplate; but beyond which could be distinguished, dearer than all such treasures, a fleeting smile from the sun, which could be seen and felt as well here, in the blue and gentle flood in which it washed the masonry, as on the pavement of the Square or the straw of the market-place; and even on our first Sundays, when we came down before Easter, it would console me for the blackness and bareness of the earth outside by making burst into blossom, as in some springtime in old history among the heirs of Saint Louis, this dazzling and gilded carpet of forget-me-nots in glass.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Two tapestries of high warp represented the coronation of Esther in which tradition would have it that the weaver had given to Ahasuerus the features of one of the kings of France and to Esther those of a lady of Guermantes whose lover he had been; their colours had melted into one another, so as to add expression, relief, light to the pictures. A touch of red over the lips of Esther had strayed beyond their outline; the yellow on her dress was spread with such unctuous plumpness as to have acquired a kind of solidity, and stood boldly out from the receding atmosphere; while the green of the trees, which was still bright in Silk and wool among the lower parts of the panel, but had quite \\\\'gone\\\\' at the top, separated in a paler scheme, above the dark trunks, the yellowing upper branches, tanned and half-obliterated by the sharp though sidelong rays of an invisible sun. All these things and, still more than these, the treasures which had come to the church from personages who to me were almost legendary figures such as the golden cross wrought, it was said, by Saint Eloi and presented by Dagobert, and the tomb of the sons of Louis the Germanic in porphyry and enamelled copper, because of which I used to go forward into the church when we were making our way to our chairs as into a fairy-haunted valley, where the rustic sees with amazement on a rock, a tree, a marsh, the tangible proofs of the little people\\\\'s supernatural passage\\u2014all these things made of the church for me something entirely different from the rest of the town; a building which occupied, so to speak, four dimensions of space\\u2014the name of the fourth being Time\\u2014which had sailed the centuries with that old nave, where bay after bay, chapel after chapel, seemed to stretch across and hold down and conquer not merely a few yards of soil, but each successive epoch from which the whole building had emerged triumphant, hiding the rugged barbarities of the eleventh century in the thickness of its walls, through which nothing could be seen of the heavy arches, long stopped and blinded with coarse blocks of ashlar, except where, near the porch, a deep groove was furrowed into one wall by the tower-stair; and even there the barbarity was veiled by the graceful gothic arcade which pressed coquettishly upon it, like a row of grown-up sisters who, to hide him from the eyes of strangers, arrange themselves smilingly in front of a countrified, unmannerly and ill-dressed younger brother; rearing into the sky above the Square a tower which had looked down upon Saint Louis, and seemed to behold him still; and thrusting down with its crypt into the blackness of a Merovingian night, through which, guiding us with groping finger-tips beneath the shadowy vault, ribbed strongly as an immense bat\\\\'s wing of stone, Th\\u00e9odore or his sister would light up for us with a candle the tomb of Sigebert\\\\'s little daughter, in which a deep hole, like the bed of a fossil, had been bored, or so it was said, \\\"by a crystal lamp which, on the night when the Frankish princess was murdered, had left, of its own accord, the golden chains by which it was suspended where the apse is to-day and with neither the crystal broken nor the light extinguished had buried itself in the stone, through which it had gently forced its way.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And then the apse of Combray: what am I to say of that? It was so coarse, so devoid of artistic beauty, even of the religious spirit. From outside, since the street crossing which it commanded was on a lower level, its great wall was thrust upwards from a basement of unfaced ashlar, jagged with flints, in all of which there was nothing particularly ecclesiastical; the windows seemed to have been pierced at an abnormal height, and its whole appearance was that of a prison wall rather than of a church. And certainly in later years, were I to recall all the glorious apses that I had seen, it would never enter my mind to compare with any one of them the apse of Combray. Only, one day, turning out of a little street in some country town, I came upon three alley-ways that converged, and facing them an old wall, rubbed, worn, crumbling, and unusually high; with windows pierced in it far overhead and the same asymmetrical appearance as the apse of Combray. And at that moment I did not say to myself, as at Chartres I might have done or at Rheims, with what strength the religious feeling had been expressed in its construction, but instinctively I exclaimed \\\"The Church!\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The church! A dear, familiar friend; close pressed in the Rue Saint-Hilaire, upon which its north door opened, by its two neighbours, Mme. Loiseau\\\\'s house and the pharmacy of M. Rapin, against which its walls rested without interspace; a simple citizen of Combray, who might have had her number in the street had the streets of Combray borne numbers, and at whose door one felt that the postman ought to stop on his morning rounds, before going into Mme. Loiseau\\\\'s and after leaving M. Rapin\\\\'s, there existed, for all that, between the church and everything in Combray that was not the church a clear line of demarcation which I have never succeeded in eliminating from my mind. In vain might Mme. Loiseau deck her window-sills with fuchsias, which developed the bad habit of letting their branches trail at all times and in all directions, head downwards, and whose flowers had no more important business, when they were big enough to taste the joys of life, than to go and cool their purple, congested cheeks against the dark front of the church; to me such conduct sanctified the fuchsias not at all; between the flowers and the blackened stones towards which they leaned, if my eyes could discern no interval, my mind preserved the impression of an abyss.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0From a long way off one could distinguish and identify the steeple of Saint-Hilaire inscribing its unforgettable form upon a horizon beneath which Combray had not yet appeared; when from the train which brought us down from Paris at Easter-time my father caught sight of it, as it slipped into every fold of the sky in turn, its little iron cock veering continually in all directions, he would say: \\\"Come, get your wraps together, we are there.\\\" And on one of the longest walks we ever took from Combray there was a spot where the narrow road emerged suddenly on to an immense plain, closed at the horizon by strips of forest over which rose and stood alone the fine point of Saint-Hilaire\\\\'s steeple, but so sharpened and so pink that it seemed to be no more than sketched on the sky by the finger-nail of a painter anxious to give to such a landscape, to so pure a piece of \\\\'nature,\\\\' this little sign of art, this single indication of human existence. As one drew near it and could make out the remains of the square tower, half in ruins, which still stood by its side, though without rivalling it in height, one was struck, first of all, by the tone, reddish and sombre, of its stones; and on a misty morning in autumn one would have called it, to see it rising above the violet thunder-cloud of the vineyards, a ruin of purple, almost the colour of the wild vine.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Often in the Square, as we came home, my grandmother would make me stop to look up at it. From the tower windows, placed two and two, one pair above another, with that right and original proportion in their spacing to which not only human faces owe their beauty and dignity, it released, it let fall at regular intervals flights of jackdaws which for a little while would wheel and caw, as though the ancient stones which allowed them to sport thus and never seemed to see them, becoming of a sudden uninhabitable and discharging some infinitely disturbing element, had struck them and driven them forth. Then after patterning everywhere the violet velvet of the evening air, abruptly soothed, they would return and be absorbed in the tower, deadly no longer but benignant, some perching here and there not seeming to move, but snapping, perhaps, and swallowing some passing insect on the points of turrets, as a seagull perches, with an angler\\\\'s immobility, on the crest of a wave. Without quite knowing why, my grandmother found in the steeple of Saint-Hilaire that absence of vulgarity, pretension, and meanness which made her love\\u2014and deem rich in beneficent influences\\u2014nature itself, when the hand of man had not, as did my great-aunt\\\\'s gardener, trimmed it, and the works of genius. And certainly every part one saw of the church served to distinguish the whole from any other building by a kind of general feeling which pervaded it, but it was in the steeple that the church seemed to display a consciousness of itself, to affirm its individual and responsible existence. It was the steeple which spoke for the church. I think, too, that in a confused way my grandmother found in the steeple of Combray what she prized above anything else in the world, namely, a natural air and an air of distinction. Ignorant of architecture, she would say:  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"My dears, laugh at me if you like; it is not conventionally beautiful, but there is something in its quaint old face which pleases me. If it could play the piano, I am sure it would really play.\\\" And when she gazed on it, when her eyes followed the gentle tension, the fervent inclination of its stony slopes which drew together as they rose, like hands joined in prayer, she would absorb herself so utterly in the outpouring of the spire that her gaze seemed to leap upwards with it; her lips at the same time curving in a friendly smile for the worn old stones of which the setting sun now illumined no more than the topmost pinnacles, which, at the point where they entered that zone of sunlight and were softened and sweetened by it, seemed to have mounted suddenly far higher, to have become truly remote, like a song whose singer breaks into falsetto, an octave above the accompanying air.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0It was the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which shaped and crowned and consecrated every occupation, every hour of the day, every point of view in the town. From my bedroom window I could discern no more than its base, which had been freshly covered with slates; but when on Sundays I saw these, in the hot light of a summer morning, blaze like a black sun I would say to myself: \\\"Good heavens! nine o\\\\'clock! I must get ready for mass at once if I am to have time to go in and kiss aunt L\\u00e9onie first,\\\" and I would know exactly what was the colour of the sunlight upon the Square, I could feel the heat and dust of the market, the shade behind the blinds of the shop into which Mamma would perhaps go on her way to mass, penetrating its odour of unbleached calico, to purchase a handkerchief or something, of which the draper himself would let her see what he had, bowing from the waist: who, having made everything ready for shutting up, had just gone into the back shop to put on his Sunday coat and to wash his hands, which it was his habit, every few minutes and even on the saddest occasions, to rub one against the other with an air of enterprise, cunning, and success.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And again, after mass, when we looked in to tell Th\\u00e9odore to bring a larger loaf than usual because our cousins had taken advantage of the fine weather to come over from Thiberzy for luncheon, we had in front of us the steeple, which, baked and brown itself like a larger loaf still of \\\\'holy bread,\\\\' with flakes and sticky drops on it of sunlight, pricked its sharp point into the blue sky. And in the evening, as I came in from my walk and thought of the approaching moment when I must say good night to my mother and see her no more, the steeple was by contrast so kindly, there at the close of day, that I would imagine it as being laid, like a brown velvet cushion, against\\u2014as being thrust into the pallid sky which had yielded beneath its pressure, had sunk slightly so as to make room for it, and had correspondingly risen on either side; while the cries of the birds wheeling to and fro about it seemed to intensify its silence, to elongate its spire still further, and to invest it with some quality beyond the power of words.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Even when our errands lay in places behind the church, from which it could not be seen, the view seemed always to have been composed with reference to the steeple, which would stand up, now here, now there, among the houses, and was perhaps even more affecting when it appeared thus without the church. And, indeed, there are many others which look best when seen in this way, and I can call to mind vignettes of housetops with surmounting steeples in quite another category of art than those formed by the dreary streets of Combray. I shall never forget, in a quaint Norman town not far from Balbec, two charming eighteenth-century houses, dear to me and venerable for many reasons, between which, when one looks up at them from a fine garden which descends in terraces to the river, the gothic spire of a church itself hidden by the houses soars into the sky with the effect of crowning and completing their fronts, but in a material so different, so precious, so beringed, so rosy, so polished, that it is at once seen to be no more a part of them than would be a part of two pretty pebbles lying side by side, between which it had been washed on the beach, the purple, crinkled spire of some sea-shell spun out into a turret and gay with glossy colour. Even in Paris, in one of the ugliest parts of the town, I know a window from which one can see across a first, a second, and even a third layer of jumbled roofs, street beyond street, a violet bell, sometimes ruddy, sometimes too, in the finest \\\\'prints\\\\' which the atmosphere makes of it, of an ashy solution of black; which is, in fact, nothing else than the dome of Saint-Augustin, and which imparts to this view of Paris the character of some of the Piranesi views of Rome. But since into none of these little etchings, whatever the taste my memory may have been able to bring to their execution, was it able to contribute an element I have long lost, the feeling which makes us not merely regard a thing as a spectacle, but believe in it as in a creature without parallel, so none of them keeps in dependence on it a whole section of my inmost life as does the memory of those aspects of the steeple of Combray from the streets behind the church. Whether one saw it at five o\\\\'clock when going to call for letters at the post-office, some doors away from one, on the left, raising abruptly with its isolated peak the ridge of housetops; or again, when one had to go in and ask for news of Mme. Sazerat, one\\\\'s eyes followed the line where it ran low again beyond the farther, descending slope, and one knew that it would be the second turning after the steeple; or yet again, if pressing further afield one went to the station, one saw it obliquely, shewing in profile fresh angles and surfaces, like a solid body surprised at some unknown point in its revolution; or, from the banks of the Vivonne, the apse, drawn muscularly together and heightened in perspective, seemed to spring upwards with the effort which the steeple made to hurl its spire-point into the heart of heaven: it was always to the steeple that one must return, always it which dominated everything else, summing up the houses with an unexpected pinnacle, raised before me like the Finger of God, Whose Body might have been concealed below among the crowd of human bodies without fear of my confounding It, for that reason, with them. And so even to-day in any large provincial town, or in a quarter of Paris which I do not know well, if a passer-by who is \\\\'putting me on the right road\\\\' shews me from afar, as a point to aim at, some belfry of a hospital, or a convent steeple lifting the peak of its ecclesiastical cap at the corner of the street which I am to take, my memory need only find in it some dim resemblance to that dear and vanished outline, and the passer-by, should he turn round to make sure that I have not gone astray, would see me, to his astonishment, oblivious of the walk that I had planned to take or the place where I was obliged to call, standing still on the spot, before that steeple, for hours on end, motionless, trying to remember, feeling deep within myself a tract of soil reclaimed from the waters of Lethe slowly drying until the buildings rise on it again; and then no doubt, and then more uneasily than when, just now, I asked him for a direction, I will seek my way again, I will turn a corner... but... the goal is in my heart...  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0On our way home from mass we would often meet M. Legrandin, who, detained in Paris by his professional duties as an engineer, could only except in the regular holiday seasons visit his home at Combray between Saturday evenings and Monday mornings. He was one of that class of men who, apart from a scientific career in which they may well have proved brilliantly successful, have acquired an entirely different kind of culture, literary or artistic, of which they make no use in the specialised work of their profession, but by which their conversation profits. More \\\\'literary\\\\' than many \\\\'men of letters\\\\' we were not aware at this period that M. Legrandin had a distinct reputation as a writer, and so were greatly astonished to find that a well-known composer had set some verses of his to music, endowed with a greater ease in execution than many painters, they imagine that the life they are obliged to lead is not that for which they are really fitted, and they bring to their regular occupations either a fantastic indifference or a sustained and lofty application, scornful, bitter, and conscientious. Tall, with a good figure, a fine, thoughtful face, drooping fair moustaches, a look of disillusionment in his blue eyes, an almost exaggerated refinement of courtesy; a talker such as we had never heard; he was in the sight of my family, who never ceased to quote him as an example, the very pattern of a gentleman, who took life in the noblest and most delicate manner. My grandmother alone found fault with him for speaking a little too well, a little too much like a book, for not using a vocabulary as natural as his loosely knotted Lavalli\\u00e8re neckties, his short, straight, almost schoolboyish coat. She was astonished, too, at the furious invective which he was always launching at the aristocracy, at fashionable life, and \\\\'snobbishness\\\\'\\u2014\\\"undoubtedly,\\\" he would say, \\\"the sin of which Saint Paul is thinking when he speaks of the sin for which there is no forgiveness.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Worldly ambition was a thing which my grandmother was so little capable of feeling, or indeed of understanding, that it seemed to her futile to apply so much heat to its condemnation. Besides, she thought it in not very good taste that M. Legrandin, whose sister was married to a country gentleman of Lower Normandy near Balbec, should deliver himself of such violent attacks upon the nobles, going so far as to blame the Revolution for not having guillotined them all.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Well met, my friends!\\\" he would say as he came towards us. \\\"You are lucky to spend so much time here; to-morrow I have to go back to Paris, to squeeze back into my niche.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Oh, I admit,\\\" he went on, with his own peculiar smile, gently ironical, disillusioned and vague, \\\"I have every useless thing in the world in my house there. The only thing wanting is the necessary thing, a great patch of open sky like this. Always try to keep a patch of sky above your life, little boy,\\\" he added, turning to me. \\\"You have a soul in you of rare quality, an artist\\\\'s nature; never let it starve for lack of what it needs.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0When, on our reaching the house, my aunt would send to ask us whether Mme. Goupil had indeed arrived late for mass, not one of us could inform her. Instead, we increased her anxiety by telling her that there was a painter at work in the church copying the window of Gilbert the Bad. Fran\\u00e7oise was at once dispatched to the grocer\\\\'s, but returned empty-handed owing to the absence of Th\\u00e9odore, whose dual profession of choirman, with a part in the maintenance of the fabric, and of grocer\\\\'s assistant gave him not only relations with all sections of society, but an encyclopaedic knowledge of their affairs.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Ah!\\\" my aunt would sigh, \\\"I wish it were time for Eulalie to come. She is really the only person who will be able to tell me.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Eulalie was a limping, energetic, deaf spinster who had \\\\'retired\\\\' after the death of Mme. de la Bretonnerie, with whom she had been in service from her childhood, and had then taken a room beside the church, from which she would incessantly emerge, either to attend some service, or, when there was no service, to say a prayer by herself or to give Th\\u00e9odore a hand; the rest of her time she spent in visiting sick persons like my aunt L\\u00e9onie, to whom she would relate everything that had occurred at mass or vespers. She was not above adding occasional pocket-money to the little income which was found for her by the family of her old employers by going from time to time to look after the Cur\\u00e9\\\\'s linen, or that of some other person of note in the clerical world of Combray. Above a mantle of black cloth she wore a little white coif that seemed almost to attach her to some Order, and an infirmity of the skin had stained part of her cheeks and her crooked nose the bright red colour of balsam. Her visits were the one great distraction in the life of my aunt L\\u00e9onie, who now saw hardly anyone else, except the reverend Cur\\u00e9. My aunt had by degrees erased every other visitor\\\\'s name from her list, because they all committed the fatal error, in her eyes, of falling into one or other of the two categories of people she most detested. One group, the worse of the two, and the one of which she rid herself first, consisted of those who advised her not to take so much care of herself, and preached even if only negatively and with no outward signs beyond an occasional disapproving silence or doubting smile the subversive doctrine that a sharp walk in the sun and a good red beefsteak would do her more good her, who had had two dreadful sips of Vichy water on her stomach for fourteen hours! than all her medicine bottles and her bed. The other category was composed of people who appeared to believe that she was more seriously ill than she thought, in fact that she was as seriously ill as she said. And so none of those whom she had allowed upstairs to her room, after considerable hesitation and at Fran\\u00e7oise urgent request, and who in the course of their visit had shewn how unworthy they were of the honour which had been done them by venturing a timid: \\\"Don\\\\'t you think that if you were just to stir out a little on really fine days...?\\\" or who, on the other hand, when she said to them: \\\"I am very low, very low; nearing the end, dear friends!\\\" had replied: \\\"Ah, yes, when one has no strength left! Still, you may last a while yet\\\"; each party alike might be certain that her doors would never open to them again. And if Fran\\u00e7oise was amused by the look of consternation on my aunt\\\\'s face whenever she saw, from her bed, any of these people in the Rue du Saint-Esprit, who looked as if they were coming to see her, or heard her own door-bell ring, she would laugh far more heartily, as at a clever trick, at my aunt\\\\'s devices which never failed for having them sent away, and at their look of discomfiture when they had to turn back without having seen her; and would be filled with secret admiration for her mistress, whom she felt to be superior to all these other people, inasmuch as she could and did contrive not to see them. In short, my aunt stipulated, at one and the same time, that whoever came to see her must approve of her way of life, commiserate with her in her sufferings, and assure her of an ultimate recovery.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0In all this Eulalie excelled. My aunt might say to her twenty times in a minute: \\\"The end is come at last, my poor Eulalie!\\\", twenty times Eulalie would retort with: \\\"Knowing your illness as you do, Mme. Octave, you will live to be a hundred, as Mme. Sazerin said to me only yesterday.\\\" For one of Eulalie\\\\'s most rooted beliefs, and one that the formidable list of corrections which her experience must have compiled was powerless to eradicate, was that Mme. Sazerat\\\\'s name was really Mme. Sazerin.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"I do not ask to live to a hundred,\\\" my aunt would say, for she preferred to have no definite limit fixed to the number of her days.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And since, besides this, Eulalie knew, as no one else knew, how to distract my aunt without tiring her, her visits, which took place regularly every Sunday, unless something unforeseen occurred to prevent them, were for my aunt a pleasure the prospect of which kept her on those days in a state of expectation, appetising enough to begin with, but at once changing to the agony of a hunger too long unsatisfied if Eulalie were a minute late in coming. For, if unduly prolonged, the rapture of waiting for Eulalie became a torture, and my aunt would never cease from looking at the time, and yawning, and complaining of each of her symptoms in turn. Eulalie\\\\'s ring, if it sounded from the front door at the very end of the day, when she was no longer expecting it, would almost make her ill. For the fact was that on Sundays she thought of nothing else than this visit, and the moment that our luncheon was ended Fran\\u00e7oise would become impatient for us to leave the dining-room so that she might go upstairs to \\\\'occupy\\\\' my aunt. But\\u2014and this more than ever from the day on which fine weather definitely set in at Combray\\u2014the proud hour \\u00b0f noon, descending from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which it blazoned for a moment with the twelve points of its sonorous crown, would long have echoed about our table, beside the \\\\'holy bread,\\\\' which too had come in, after church, in its familiar way; and we would still be found seated in front of our Arabian Nights plates, weighed down by the heat of the day, and even more by our heavy meal. For upon the permanent foundation of eggs, cutlets, potatoes, preserves, and biscuits, whose appearance on the table she no longer announced to us, Fran\\u00e7oise would add\\u2014as the labour of fields and orchards, the harvest of the tides, the luck of the markets, the kindness of neighbours, and her own genius might provide; and so effectively that our bill of fare, like the quatrefoils that were carved on the porches of cathedrals in the thirteenth century, reflected to some extent the march of the seasons and the incidents of human life\\u2014a brill, because the fish-woman had guaranteed its freshness; a turkey, because she had seen a beauty in the market at Roussainville-le-Pin; cardoons with marrow, because she had never done them for us in that way before; a roast leg of mutton, because the fresh air made one hungry and there would be plenty of time for it to \\\\'settle down\\\\' in the seven hours before dinner; spinach, by way of a change; apricots, because they were still hard to get; gooseberries, because in another fortnight there would be none left; raspberries, which M. Swann had brought specially; cherries, the first to come from the cherry-tree, which had yielded none for the last two years; a cream cheese, of which in those days I was extremely fond; an almond cake, because she had ordered one the evening before; a fancy loaf, because it was our turn to \\\\'offer\\\\' the holy bread. And when all these had been eaten, a work composed expressly for ourselves, but dedicated more particularly to my father, who had a fondness for such things, a cream of chocolate, inspired in the mind, created by the hand of Fran\\u00e7oise, would be laid before us, light and fleeting as an \\\\'occasional piece\\\\' of music, into which she had poured the whole of her talent. Anyone who refused to partake of it, saying: \\\"No, thank you, I have finished; I am not hungry,\\\" would at once have been lowered to the level of the Philistines who, when an artist makes them a present of one of his works, examine its weight and material, whereas what is of value is the creator\\\\'s intention and his signature. To have left even the tiniest morsel in the dish would have shewn as much discourtesy as to rise and leave a concert hall while the \\\\'piece\\\\' was still being played, and under the composer\\\\'s-very eyes.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0At length my mother would say to me: \\\"Now, don\\\\'t stay here all day; you can go up to your room if you are too hot outside, but get a little fresh air first; don\\\\'t start reading immediately after your food.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And I would go and sit down beside the pump and its trough, ornamented here and there, like a gothic font, with a salamander, which modelled upon a background of crumbling stone the quick relief of its slender, allegorical body; on the bench without a back, in the shade of a lilac-tree, in that little corner of the garden which communicated, by a service door, with the Rue du Saint-Esprit, and from whose neglected soil rose, in two stages, an outcrop from the house itself and apparently a separate building, my aunt\\\\'s back-kitchen. One could see its red-tiled floor gleaming like porphyry. It seemed not so much the cave of Fran\\u00e7oise as a little temple of Venus. It would be overflowing with the offerings of the milkman, the fruiterer, the greengrocer, come sometimes from distant villages to dedicate here the first-fruits of their fields. And its roof was always surmounted by the cooing of a dove.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0In earlier days I would not have lingered in the sacred grove which surrounded this temple, for, before going upstairs to read, I would steal into the little sitting-room which my uncle Adolphe, a brother of my grandfather and an old soldier who had retired from the service as a major, used to occupy on the ground floor, a room which, even when its opened windows let in the heat, if not actually the rays of the sun which seldom penetrated so far, would never fail to emit that vague and yet fresh odour, suggesting at once an open-air and an old-fashioned kind of existence, which sets and keeps the nostrils dreaming when one goes into a disused gun-room. But for some years now I had not gone into my uncle Adolphe\\\\'s room, since he no longer came to Combray on account of a quarrel which had arisen between him and my family, by my fault, and in the following circumstances: Once or twice every month, in Paris, I used to be sent to pay him a. visit, as he was finishing his luncheon, wearing a plain alpaca coat, and waited upon by his servant in a working-jacket of striped linen, purple and white. He would complain that I had not been to see him for a long time; that he was being neglected; he would offer me a marchpane or a tangerine, and we would cross a room in which no one ever sat, whose fire was never lighted, whose walls were picked out with gilded mouldings, its ceiling painted blue in imitation of the sky, and its furniture upholstered in satin, as at my grandparents\\\\', only yellow; then we would enter what he called his \\\\'study,\\\\' a room whose walls were hung with prints which shewed, against a dark background, a plump and rosy goddess driving a car, or standing upon a globe, or wearing a star on her brow; pictures which were popular under the Second Empire because there was thought to be something about them that suggested Pompeii, which were then generally despised, and which now people are beginning to collect again for one single and consistent reason despite any others which they may advance, namely, that they suggest the Second Empire. And there I would stay with my uncle until his man came, with a message from the coachman, to ask him at what time he would like the carriage. My uncle would then be lost in meditation, while his astonished servant stood there, not daring to disturb him by the least movement, wondering and waiting for his answer, which never varied. For in the end, after a supreme crisis of hesitation, my uncle would utter, infallibly, the words: \\\"A quarter past two,\\\" which the servant would echo with amazement, but without disputing them: \\\"A quarter past two! Very good, sir... I will go and tell him....\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0At this date I was a lover of the theatre: a Platonic lover, of necessity, since my parents had not yet allowed me to enter one, and so incorrect was the picture I drew for myself of the pleasures to be enjoyed there that I almost believed that each of the spectators looked, as into a stereoscope, upon a stage and scenery which existed for himself alone, though closely resembling the thousand other spectacles presented to the rest of the audience individually.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Every morning I would hasten to the Moriss column to see what new plays it announced. Nothing could be more disinterested or happier than the dreams with which these announcements filled my mind, dreams which took their form from the inevitable associations of the words forming the title of the play, and also from the colour of the bills, still damp and wrinkled with paste, on which those words stood out. Nothing, unless it were such strange titles as the Testament de C\\u00e9sar Girodot, or Oedipe-Roi, inscribed not on the green bills of the Op\\u00e9ra-Comique, but on the wine-coloured bills of the Com\\u00e9die-Fran\\u00e7aise, nothing seemed to me to differ more profoundly from the sparkling white plume of the Diamants de la Couronne than the sleek, mysterious satin of the Domino Noir and since my parents had told me that, for my first visit to the theatre, I should have to choose between these two pieces, I would study exhaustively and in turn the title of one and the title of the other for those were all that I knew of either, attempting to snatch from each a foretaste of the pleasure which it offered me, and to compare this pleasure with that latent in the other title, until in the end I had shewn myself such vivid, such compelling pictures of, on the one hand, a play of dazzling arrogance, and on the other a gentle, velvety play, that I was as little capable of deciding which play I should prefer to see as if, at the dinner-table, they had obliged me to choose between rice \\u00e0 l\\\\'Imp\\u00e9ratrice and the famous cream of chocolate.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0All my conversations with my playfellows bore upon actors, whose art, although as yet I had no experience of it, was the first of all its numberless forms in which Art itself allowed me to anticipate its enjoyment. Between one actor\\\\'s tricks of intonation and inflection and another\\\\'s, the most trifling differences would strike me as being of an incalculable importance. And from what I had been told of them I would arrange them in the order of their talent in lists which I used to murmur to myself all day long: lists which in the end became petrified in my brain and were a source of annoyance to it, being irremovable.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And later, in my schooldays, whenever I ventured in class, when the master\\\\'s head was turned, to communicate with some new friend, I would always begin by asking him whether he had begun yet to go to theatres, and if he agreed that our greatest actor was undoubtedly Got, our second Delaunay, and so on. And if, in his judgment, Febvre came below Thiron, or Delaunay below Coquelin, the sudden volatility which the name of Coquelin, forsaking its stony rigidity, would engender in my mind, in which it moved upwards to the second place, the rich vitality with which the name of Delaunay would suddenly be furnished, to enable it to slip down to fourth, would stimulate and fertilise my brain with a sense of bradding and blossoming life.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0But if the thought of actors weighed so upon me, if the sight of Maubant, coming out one afternoon from the Th\\u00e9\\u00e2tre-Fran\\u00e7ais, had plunged me in the throes and sufferings of hopeless love, how much more did the name of a \\\\'star,\\\\' blazing outside the doors of a theatre, how much more, seen through the window of a brougham which passed me in the street, the hair over her forehead abloom with roses, did the face of a woman who, I would think, was perhaps an actress, leave with me a lasting disturbance, a futile and painful effort to form a picture of her private life.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0I classified, in order of talent, the most distinguished: Sarah Bernhardt, Berma, Bartet, Madeleine Brohan, Jeanne Samary; but I was interested in them all. Now my uncle knew many of them personally, and also ladies of another class, not clearly distinguished from actresses in my mind. He used to entertain them at his house. And if we went to see him on certain days only, that was because on the other days ladies might come whom his family could not very well have met. So we at least thought; as for my uncle, his fatal readiness to pay pretty widows who had perhaps never been married and countesses whose high-sounding titles were probably no more than noms de guerre the compliment of presenting them to my grandmother or even of presenting to them some of our family jewels, had already embroiled him more than once with my grandfather. Often, if the name of some actress were mentioned in conversation, I would hear my father say, with a smile, to my mother: \\\"One of your uncle\\\\'s friends,\\\" and I would think of the weary novitiate through which, perhaps for years on end, a grown man, even a man of real importance, might have to pass, waiting on the doorstep of some such lady, while she refused to answer his letters and made her hall-porter drive him away; and imagine that my uncle was able to dispense a little jackanapes like myself from all these sufferings by introducing me in his own home to the actress, unapproachable by all the world, but for him an intimate friend.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And so\\u2014on the pretext that some lesson, the hour of which had been altered, now came at such an awkward time that it had already more than once prevented me, and would continue to prevent me, from seeing my uncle\\u2014one day, not one of the days which he set apart for our visits, I took advantage of the fact that my parents had had luncheon earlier than usual; I slipped out and, instead of going to read the playbills on their column, for which purpose I was allowed to go out unaccompanied, I ran all the way to his house. I noticed before his door a carriage and pair, with red carnations on the horses\\\\' blinkers and in the coachman\\\\'s buttonhole. As I climbed the staircase I could hear laughter and a woman\\\\'s voice, and, as soon as I had rung, silence and the sound of shutting doors. The man-servant who let me in appeared embarrassed, and said that my uncle was extremely busy and probably could not see me; he went in, however, to announce my arrival, and the same voice I had heard before said: \\\"Oh, yes! Do let him come in; just for a moment; it will be so amusing. Is that his photograph there, on your desk? And his mother your niece, isn\\\\'t she? beside it? The image of her, isn\\\\'t he? I should so like to see the little chap, just for a second.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0I could hear my uncle grumbling and growing angry; finally the manservant told me to come in.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0On the table was the same plate of marchpanes that was always there; my uncle wore the same alpaca coat as on other days; but opposite to him, in a pink silk dress with a great necklace of pearls about her throat, sat a young woman who was just finishing a tangerine. My uncertainty whether I ought to address her as Madame or Mademoiselle made me blush, and not daring to look too much in her direction, in case I should be obliged to speak to her, I hurried across to kiss my uncle. She looked at me and smiled; my uncle said \\\"My nephew!\\\" without telling her my name or telling me hers, doubtless because, since his difficulties with my grandfather, he had endeavoured as far as possible to avoid any association of his family with this other class of acquaintance.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"How like his mother he is,\\\" said the lady.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"But you have never seen my niece, except in photographs,\\\" my uncle broke in quickly, with a note of anger.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"I beg your pardon, dear friend, I passed her on the staircase last year when you were so ill. It is true I only saw her for a moment, and your staircase is rather dark; but I saw well enough to see how lovely she was. This young gentleman has her beautiful eyes, and also this,\\\" she went on, tracing a line with one finger across the lower part of her forehead. \\\"Tell me,\\\" she asked my uncle, \\\"is your niece Mme.\\u2014\\u2014; is her name the same as yours?\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"He takes most after his father,\\\" muttered my uncle, who was no more anxious to effect an introduction by proxy, in repeating Mamma\\\\'s name aloud, than to bring the two together in the flesh. \\\"He\\\\'s his father all over, and also like my poor mother.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"I have not met his father, dear,\\\" said the lady in pink, bowing her head slightly, \\\"and I never saw your poor mother. You will remember it was just after your great sorrow that we got to know one another.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0I felt somewhat disillusioned, for this young lady was in no way different from other pretty women whom I had seen from time to time at home, especially the daughter of one of our cousins, to whose house I went every New Year\\\\'s Day. Only better dressed; otherwise my uncle\\\\'s friend had the same quick and kindly glance, the same frank and friendly manner. I could find no trace in her of the theatrical appearance which I admired in photographs of actresses, nothing of the diabolical expression which would have been in keeping with the life she must lead. I had difficulty in believing that this was one of \\\\'those women,\\\\' and certainly I should never have believed her one of the \\\\'smart ones\\\\' had I not seen the carriage and pair, the pink dress, the pearly necklace, had I not been aware, too, that my uncle knew only the very best of them. But I asked myself how the millionaire who gave her her carriage and her flat and her jewels could find any pleasure in flinging his money away upon a woman who had so simple and respectable an appearance. And yet, when I thought of what her life must be like, its immorality disturbed me more, perhaps, than if it had stood before me in some concrete and recognisable form, by its secrecy and invisibility, like the plot of a novel, the hidden truth of a scandal which had driven out of the home of her middle-class parents and dedicated to the service of all mankind which had brought to the flowering-point of her beauty, had raised to fame or notoriety this woman, the play of whose features, the intonations of whose voice, like so many others I already knew, made me regard her, in spite of myself, as a young lady of good family, her who was no longer of a family at all.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0We had gone by this time into the \\\\'study,\\\\' and my uncle, who seemed a trifle embarrassed by my presence, offered her a cigarette.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"No, thank you, dear friend,\\\" she said. \\\"You know I only smoke the ones the Grand Duke sends me. I tell him that they make you jealous.\\\" And she drew from a case cigarettes covered with inscriptions in gold, in a foreign language. \\\"Why, yes,\\\" she began again suddenly. \\\"Of course I have met this young man\\\\'s father with you. Isn\\\\'t he your nephew? How on earth could I have forgotten? He was so nice, so charming to me,\\\" she went on, modestly and with feeling. But when I thought to myself what must actually have been the rude greeting which, she made out, had been so charming, I, who knew my father\\\\'s coldness and reserve, was shocked, as though at some indelicacy on his part, at the contrast between the excessive recognition bestowed on it and his never adequate geniality. It has since struck me as one of the most touching aspects of the part played in life by these idle, painstaking women that they devote all their generosity, all their talent, their transferable dreams of sentimental beauty for, like all artists, they never seek to realise the value of those dreams, or to enclose them in the four-square frame of everyday life, and their gold, which counts for little, to the fashioning of a fine and precious setting for the rubbed and scratched and ill-polished lives of men. And just as this one filled the smoking-room, where my uncle was entertaining her in his alpaca coat, with her charming person, her dress of pink silk, her pearls, and the refinement suggested by intimacy with a Grand Duke, so, in the same way, she had taken some casual remark by my father, had worked it up delicately, given it a \\\\'turn,\\\\' a precious title, set in it the gem of a glance from her own eyes, a gem of the first water, blended of humility and gratitude; and so had given it back transformed into a jewel, a work of art, into something altogether charming.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Look here, my boy, it is time you went away,\\\" said my uncle.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0I rose; I could scarcely resist a desire to kiss the hand of the lady in pink, but I felt that to do so would require as much audacity as a forcible abduction of her. My heart beat loud while I counted out to myself \\\"Shall I do it, shall I not?\\\" and then I ceased to ask myself what I ought to do so as at least to do something. Blindly, hotly, madly, flinging aside all the reasons I had just found to support such action, I seized and raised to my lips the hand she held out to me.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Isn\\\\'t he delicious! Quite a ladies\\\\' man already; he takes after his uncle. He\\\\'ll be a perfect \\\\'gentleman,\\\\'\\\" she went on, setting her teeth so as to give the word a kind of English accentuation. \\\"Couldn\\\\'t he come to me some day for \\\\'a cup of tea,\\\\' as our friends across the channel say; he need only send me a \\\\'blue\\\\' in the morning?\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0I had not the least idea of what a \\\\'blue\\\\' might be. I did not understand half the words which the lady used, but my fear lest there should be concealed in them some question which it would be impolite in me not to answer kept me from withdrawing my close attention from them, and I was beginning to feel extremely tired.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"No, no; it is impossible,\\\" said my uncle, shrugging his shoulders. \\\"He is kept busy at home all day; he has plenty of work to do. He brings back all the prizes from his school,\\\" he added in a lower tone, so that I should not hear this falsehood and interrupt with a contradiction. \\\"You can\\\\'t tell; he may turn out a little Victor Hugo, a kind of Vaulabelle, don\\\\'t you know.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Oh, I love artistic people,\\\" replied the lady in pink; \\\"there is no one like them for understanding women. Them, and really nice men like yourself. But please forgive my ignorance. Who, what is Vaulabelle? Is it those gilt books in the little glass case in your drawing-room? You know you promised to lend them to me; I will take great care of them.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0My uncle, who hated lending people books, said nothing, and ushered me out into the hall. Madly in love with the lady in pink, I covered my old uncle\\\\'s tobacco-stained cheeks with passionate kisses, and while he, awkwardly enough, gave me to understand without actually saying that he would rather I did not tell my parents about this visit, I assured him, with tears in my eyes, that his kindness had made so strong an impression upon me that some day I would most certainly find a way of expressing my gratitude. So strong an impression had it made upon me that two hours later, after a string of mysterious utterances which did not strike me as giving my parents a sufficiently clear idea of the new importance with which I had been invested, I found it simpler to let them have a full account, omitting no detail, of the visit I had paid that afternoon. In doing this I had no thought of causing my uncle any unpleasantness. How could I have thought such a thing, since I did not wish it? And I could not suppose that my parents would see any harm in a visit in which I myself saw none. Every day of our lives does not some friend or other ask us to make his apologies, without fail, to some woman to whom he has been prevented from writing; and do not we forget to do so, feeling that this woman cannot attach much importance to a silence which has none for ourselves? I imagined, like everyone else, that the brains of other people were lifeless and submissive receptacles with no power of specific reaction to any stimulus which might be applied to them; and I had not the least doubt that when I deposited in the minds of my parents the news of the acquaintance I had made at my uncle\\\\'s I should at the same time transmit to them the kindly judgment I myself had based on the introduction. Unfortunately my parents had recourse to principles entirely different from those which I suggested they should adopt when they came to form their estimate of my uncle\\\\'s conduct. My father and grandfather had \\\\'words\\\\' with him of a violent order; as I learned indirectly. A few days later, passing my uncle in the street as he drove by in an open carriage, \\u00ce felt at once all the grief, the gratitude, the remorse which I should have liked to convey to him. Beside the immensity of these emotions I considered that merely to raise my hat to him would be incongruous and petty, and might make him think that I regarded myself as bound to shew him no more than the commonest form of courtesy. I decided to abstain from so inadequate a gesture, and turned my head away. My uncle thought that, in doing so I was obeying my parents\\\\' orders; he never forgave them; and though he did not die until many years later, not one of us ever set eyes on him again.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And so I no longer used to go into the little sitting-room now kept shut of my uncle Adolphe; instead, after hanging about on the outskirts of the back-kitchen until Fran\\u00e7oise appeared on its threshold and announced: \\\"I am going to let the kitchen-maid serve the coffee and take up the hot water; it is time I went off to Mme. Octave,\\\" I would then decide to go indoors, and would go straight upstairs to my room to read. The kitchen-maid was an abstract personality, a permanent institution to which an invariable set of attributes assured a sort of fixity and continuity and identity throughout the long series of transitory human shapes in which that personality was incarnate; for we never found the same girl there two years running. In the year in which we ate such quantities of asparagus, the kitchen-maid whose duty it was to dress them was a poor sickly creature, some way \\\\'gone\\\\' in pregnancy when we arrived at Combray for Easter, and it was indeed surprising that Fran\\u00e7oise allowed her to run so many errands in the town and to do so much work in the house, for she was beginning to find a difficulty in bearing before her the mysterious casket, fuller and larger every day, whose splendid outline could be detected through the folds of her ample smocks. These last recalled the cloaks in which Giotto shrouds some of the allegorical figures in his paintings, of which M. Swann had given me photographs. He it was who pointed out the resemblance, and when he inquired after the kitchen-maid he would say: \\\"Well, how goes it with Giotto\\\\'s Charity?\\\" And indeed the poor girl, whose pregnancy had swelled and stoutened every part of her, even to her face, and the vertical, squared outlines of her cheeks, did distinctly suggest those virgins, so strong and mannish as to seem matrons rather, in whom the Virtues are personified in the Arena Chapel. And I can see now that those Virtues and Vices of Padua resembled her in another respect as well. For just as the figure of this girl had been enlarged by the additional symbol which she carried in her body, without appearing to understand what it meant, without any rendering in her facial expression of all its beauty and spiritual significance, but carried as if it were an ordinary and rather heavy burden, so it is without any apparent suspicion of what she is about that the powerfully built housewife who is portrayed in the Arena beneath the label \\\\'Caritas,\\\\' and a reproduction of whose portrait hung upon the wall of my schoolroom at Combray, incarnates that virtue, for it seems impossible, that any thought of charity can ever have found expression in her vulgar and energetic face. By a fine stroke of the painter\\\\'s invention she is tumbling all the treasures of the earth at her feet, but exactly as if she were treading grapes in a wine-press to extract their juice, or, still more, as if she had climbed on a heap of sacks to raise herself higher; and she is holding out her flaming heart to God, or shall we say \\\\'handing\\\\' it to Him, exactly as a cook might hand up a corkscrew through the skylight of her underground kitchen to some one who had called down to ask her for it from the ground-level above. The \\\\'Invidia,\\\\' again, should have had some look on her face of envy. But in this fresco, too, the symbol occupies so large a place and is represented with such realism; the serpent hissing between the lips of Envy is so huge, and so completely fills her wide-opened mouth that the muscles of her face are strained and contorted, like a child\\\\'s who is filling a balloon with his breath, and that Envy, and we ourselves for that matter, when we look at her, since all her attention and ours are concentrated on the action of her lips, have no time, almost, to spare for envious thoughts.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Despite all the admiration that M. Swann might profess for these figures of Giotto, it was a long time before I could find any pleasure in seeing in our schoolroom where the copies he had brought me were hung that Charity devoid of charity, that Envy who looked like nothing so much as a plate in some medical book, illustrating the compression of the glottis or uvula by a tumour in the tongue, or by the introduction of the operator\\\\'s instrument, a Justice whose greyish and meanly regular features were the very same as those which adorned the faces of certain good and pious and slightly withered ladies of Combray whom I used to see at mass, many of whom had long been enrolled in the reserve forces of Injustice. But in later years I understood that the arresting strangeness, the special beauty of these frescoes lay in the great part played in each of them by its symbols, while the fact that these were depicted, not as symbols for the thought symbolised was nowhere expressed, but as real things, actually felt or materially handled, added something more precise and more literal to their meaning, something more concrete and more striking to the lesson they imparted. And even in the case of the poor kitchen-maid, was not our attention incessantly drawn to her belly by the load which filled it; and in the same way, again, are not the thoughts of men and women in the agony of death often turned towards the practical, painful, obscure, internal, intestinal aspect, towards that \\\\'seamy side\\\\' of death which is, as it happens, the side that death actually presents to them and forces them to feel, a side which far more closely resembles a crushing burden, a difficulty in breathing, a destroying thirst, than the abstract idea to which we are accustomed to give the name of Death?  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0There must have been a strong element of reality in those Virtues and Vices of Padua, since they appeared to me to be as much alive as the pregnant servant-girl, while she herself appeared scarcely less allegorical than they. And, quite possibly, this lack or seeming lack of participation by a person\\\\'s soul in the significant marks of its own special virtue has, apart from its aesthetic meaning, a reality which, if not strictly psychological, may at least be called physiognomical. Later on, when, in the course of my life, I have had occasion to meet with, in convents for instance, literally saintly examples of practical charity, they have generally had the brisk, decided, undisturbed, and slightly brutal air of a busy surgeon, the face in which one can discern no commiseration, no tenderness at the sight of suffering humanity, and no fear of hurting it, the face devoid of gentleness or sympathy, the sublime face of true goodness.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Then while the kitchen-maid\\u2014who, all unawares, made the superior qualities of Fran\\u00e7oise shine with added lustre, just as Error, by force of contrast, enhances the triumph of Truth\\u2014took in coffee which according to Mamma was nothing more than hot water, and then carried up to our rooms hot water which was barely tepid, I would be lying stretched out on my bed, a book in my hand, in my room which trembled with the effort to defend its frail, transparent coolness against the afternoon sun, behind its almost closed shutters through which, however, a reflection of the sunlight had contrived to slip in on its golden wings, remaining motionless, between glass and woodwork, in a corner, like a butterfly poised upon a flower. It was hardly light enough for me to read, and my feeling of the day\\\\'s brightness and splendour was derived solely from the blows struck down below, in the Rue de la Cur\\u00e9, by Camus whom Fran\\u00e7oise had assured that my aunt was not \\\\'resting\\\\' and that he might therefore make a noise, upon some old packing-cases from which nothing would really be sent flying but the dust, though the din of them, in the resonant atmosphere that accompanies hot weather, seemed to scatter broadcast a rain of blood-red stars; and from the flies who performed for my benefit, in their small concert, as it might be the chamber music of summer; evoking heat and light quite differently from an air of human music which, if you happen to have heard it during a fine summer, will always bring that summer back to your mind, the flies\\\\' music is bound to the season by a closer, a more vital tie\\u2014born of sunny days, and not to be reborn but with them, containing something of their essential nature, it not merely calls up their image in our memory, but gives us a guarantee that they do really exist, that they are close around us, immediately accessible.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0This dim freshness of my room was to the broad daylight of the street what the shadow is to the sunbeam, that is to say, equally luminous, and presented to my imagination the entire panorama of summer, which my senses, if I had been out walking, could have tasted and enjoyed in fragments only; and so was quite in harmony with my state of repose, which thanks to the adventures related in my books, which had just excited it bore, like a hand reposing motionless in a stream of running water, the shock and animation of a torrent of activity and life.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0But my grandmother, even if the weather, after growing too hot, had broken, and a storm, or just a shower, had burst over us, would come up and beg me to go outside. And as I did not wish to leave off my book, I would go on with it in the garden, under the chestnut-tree, in a little sentry-box of canvas and matting, in the farthest recesses of which I used to sit and feel that I was hidden from the eyes of anyone who might be coming to call upon the family.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And then my thoughts, did not they form a similar sort of hiding-hole, in the depths of which I felt that I could bury myself and remain invisible even when I was looking at what went on outside? When I saw any external object, my consciousness that I was seeing it would remain between me and it, enclosing it in a slender, incorporeal outline which prevented me from ever coming directly in contact with the material form; for it would volatilise itself in some way before I could touch it, just as an incandescent body which is moved towards something wet never actually touches moisture, since it is always preceded, itself, by a zone of evaporation. Upon the sort of screen, patterned with different states and impressions, which my consciousness would quietly unfold while I was reading, and which ranged from the most deeply hidden aspirations of my heart to the wholly external view of the horizon spread out before my eyes at the foot of the garden, what was from the first the most permanent and the most intimate part of me, the lever whose incessant movements controlled all the rest, was my belief in the philosophic richness and beauty of the book I was reading, and my desire to appropriate these to myself, whatever the book might be. For even if I had purchased it at Combray, having seen it outside Borange\\\\'s, whose grocery lay too far from our house for Fran\\u00e7oise to be able to deal there, as she did with Camus, but who enjoyed better custom as a stationer and bookseller; even if I had seen it, tied with string to keep it in its place in the mosaic of monthly parts and pamphlets which adorned either side of his doorway, a doorway more mysterious, more teeming with suggestion than that of a cathedral, I should have noticed and bought it there simply because I had recognised it as a book which had been well spoken of, in my hearing, by the school-master or the school-friend who, at that particular time, seemed to me to be entrusted with the secret of Truth and Beauty, things half-felt by me, half-incomprehensible, the full understanding of which was the vague but permanent object of my thoughts.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Next to this central belief, which, while I was reading, would be constantly a motion from my inner self to the outer world, towards the discovery of Truth, came the emotions aroused in me by the action in which I would be taking part, for these afternoons were crammed with more dramatic and sensational events than occur, often, in a whole lifetime. These were the events which took place in the book I was reading. It is true that the people concerned in them were not what Fran\\u00e7oise would have called \\\\'real people.\\\\' But none of the feelings which the joys or misfortunes of a \\\\'real\\\\' person awaken in us can be awakened except through a mental picture of those joys or misfortunes; and the ingenuity of the first novelist lay in his understanding that, as the picture was the one essential element in the complicated structure of our emotions, so that simplification of it which consisted in the suppression, pure and simple, of \\\\'real\\\\' people would be a decided improvement. A \\\\'real\\\\' person, profoundly as we may sympathise with him, is in a great measure perceptible only through our senses, that is to say, he remains opaque, offers a dead weight which our sensibilities have not the strength to lift. If some misfortune comes to him, it is only in one small section of the complete idea we have of him that we are capable of feeling any emotion; indeed it is only in one small section of the complete idea he has of himself that he is capable of feeling any emotion either. The novelist\\\\'s happy discovery was to think of substituting for those opaque sections, impenetrable by the human spirit, their equivalent in immaterial sections, things, that is, which the spirit can assimilate to itself. After which it matters not that the actions, the feelings of this new order of creatures appear to us in the guise of truth, since we have made them our own, since it is in ourselves that they are happening, that they are holding in thrall, while we turn over, feverishly, the pages of the book, our quickened breath and staring eyes. And once the novelist has brought us to that state, in which, as in all purely mental states, every emotion is multiplied ten-fold, into which his book comes to disturb us as might a dream, but a dream more lucid, and of a more lasting impression than those which come to us in sleep; why, then, for the space of an hour he sets free within us all the joys and sorrows in the world, a few of which, only, we should have to spend years of our actual life in getting to know, and the keenest, the most intense of which would never have been revealed to us because the slow course of their development stops our perception of them. It is the same in life; the heart changes, and that is our worst misfortune; but we learn of it only from reading or by imagination; for in reality its alteration, like that of certain natural phenomena, is so gradual that, even if we are able to distinguish, successively, each of its different states, we are still spared the actual sensation of change.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Next to, but distinctly less intimate a part of myself than this human element, would come the view, more or less projected before my eyes, of the country in which the action of the story was taking place, which made a far stronger impression on my mind than the other, the actual landscape which would meet my eyes when I raised them from my book. In this way, for two consecutive summers I used to sit in the heat of our Combray garden, sick with a longing inspired by the book I was then reading for a land of mountains and rivers, where I could see an endless vista of sawmills, where beneath the limpid currents fragments of wood lay mouldering in beds of watercress; and nearby, rambling and clustering along low walls, purple flowers and red. And since there was always lurking in my mind the dream of a woman who would enrich me with her love, that dream in those two summers used to be quickened with the freshness and coolness of running water; and whoever she might be, the woman whose image I called to mind, purple flowers and red would at once spring up on either side of her like complementary colours.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0This was not only because an image of which we dream remains for ever distinguished, is adorned and enriched by the association of colours not its own which may happen to surround it in our mental picture; for the scenes in the books I read were to me not merely scenery more vividly portrayed by my imagination than any which Combray could spread before my eyes but otherwise of the same kind. Because of the selection that the author had made of them, because of the spirit of faith in which my mind would exceed and anticipate his printed word, as it might be interpreting a revelation, these scenes used to give me the impression\\u2014one which I hardly ever derived from any place in which I might happen to be, and never from our garden, that undistinguished product of the strictly conventional fantasy of the gardener whom my grandmother so despised\\u2014of their being actually part of Nature herself, and worthy to be studied and explored.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Had my parents allowed me, when I read a book, to pay a visit to the country it described, I should have felt that I was making an enormous advance towards the ultimate conquest of truth. For even if we have the sensation of being always enveloped in, surrounded by our own soul, still it does not seem a fixed and immovable prison; rather do we seem to be borne away with it, and perpetually struggling to pass beyond it, to break out into the world, with a perpetual discouragement as we hear endlessly, all around us, that unvarying sound which is no echo from without, but the resonance of a vibration from within. We try to discover in things, endeared to us on that account, the spiritual glamour which we ourselves have cast upon them; we are disillusioned, and learn that they are in themselves barren and devoid of the charm which they owed, in our minds, to the association of certain ideas; sometimes we mobilise all our spiritual forces in a glittering array so as to influence and subjugate other human beings who, as we very well know, are situated outside ourselves, where we can never reach them. And so, if I always imagined the woman I loved as in a setting of whatever places I most longed, at the time, to visit; if in my secret longings it was she who attracted me to them, who opened to me the gate of an unknown world, that was not by the mere hazard of a simple association of thoughts; no, it was because my dreams of travel and of love were only moments\\u2014which I isolate artificially to-day as though I were cutting sections, at different heights, in a jet of water, rainbow-flashing but seemingly without flow or motion\\u2014were only drops in a single, undeviating, irresistible outrush of all the forces of my life.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And then, as I continue to trace the outward course of these impressions from their close-packed intimate source in my consciousness, and before I come to the horizon of reality which envelops them, I discover pleasures of another kind, those of being comfortably seated, of tasting the good scent on the air, of not being disturbed by any visitor; and, when an hour chimed from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire, of watching what was already spent of the afternoon fall drop by drop until I heard the last stroke which enabled me to add up the total sum, after which the silence that followed seemed to herald the beginning, in the blue sky above me, of that long part of the day still allowed me for reading, until the good dinner which Fran\\u00e7oise was even now preparing should come to strengthen and refresh me after the strenuous pursuit of its hero through the pages of my book. And, as each hour struck, it would seem to me that a few seconds only had passed since the hour before; the latest would inscribe itself, close to its predecessor, on the sky\\\\'s surface, and I would be unable to believe that sixty minutes could be squeezed into the tiny arc of blue which was comprised between their two golden figures. Sometimes it would even happen that this precocious hour would sound two strokes more than the last; there must then have been an hour which I had not heard strike; something which had taken place had not taken place for me; the fascination of my book, a magic as potent as the deepest slumber, had stopped my enchanted ears and had obliterated the sound of that golden bell from the azure surface of the enveloping silence. Sweet Sunday afternoons beneath the chestnut-tree in our Combray garden, from which I was careful to eliminate every commonplace incident of my actual life, replacing them by a career of strange adventures and ambitions in a land watered by living streams, you still recall those adventures and ambitions to my mind when I think of you, and you embody and preserve them by virtue of having little by little drawn round and enclosed them while I went on with my book and the heat of the day declined in the gradual crystallisation, slowly altering in form and dappled with a pattern of chestnut-leaves, of your silent, sonorous, fragrant, limpid hours.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Sometimes I would be torn from my book, in the middle of the afternoon, by the gardener\\\\'s daughter, who came running like a mad thing, overturning an orange-tree in its tub, cutting a finger, breaking a tooth, and screaming out \\\"They\\\\'re coming, they\\\\'re coming!\\\" so that Fran\\u00e7oise and I should run too and not miss anything of the show. That was on days when the cavalry stationed in Combray went out for some military exercise, going as a rule by the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde. While our servants, sitting in a row on their chairs outside the garden railings, stared at the people of Combray taking their Sunday walks and were stared at in return, the gardener\\\\'s daughter, through the gap which there was between two houses far away in the Avenue de la Gare, would have spied the glitter of helmets. The servants then hurried in with their chairs, for when the troopers filed through the Rue Sainte-Hildegarde they filled it from side to side, and their jostling horses scraped against the walls of the houses, covering and drowning the pavements like banks which present too narrow a channel to a river in flood.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Poor children,\\\" Fran\\u00e7oise would exclaim, in tears almost before she had reached the railings; \\\"poor boys, to be mown down like grass in a meadow. It\\\\'s just shocking to think of,\\\" she would go on, laying a hand over her heart, where presumably she had felt the shock.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"A fine sight, isn\\\\'t it, Mme. Fran\\u00e7oise, all these young fellows not caring two straws for their lives?\\\" the gardener would ask, just to \\\\'draw\\\\' her. And he would not have spoken in vain.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Not caring for their lives, is it? Why, what in the world is there that we should care for if it\\\\'s not our lives, the only gift the Lord never offers us a second time? Oh dear, oh dear; you\\\\'re right all the same; it\\\\'s quite true, they don\\\\'t care! I can remember them in \\\\'70; in those wretched wars they\\\\'ve no fear of death left in them; they\\\\'re nothing more nor less than madmen; and then they aren\\\\'t worth the price of a rope to hang them with; they\\\\'re not men any more, they\\\\'re lions.\\\" For by her way of thinking, to compare a man with a lion, which she used to pronounce \\\\'lie-on,\\\\' was not at all complimentary to the man.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The Rue Sainte-Hildegarde turned too sharply for us to be able to see people approaching at any distance, and it was only through the gap between those two houses in the Avenue de la Gare that we could still make out fresh helmets racing along towards us, and flashing in the sunlight. The gardener wanted to know whether there were still many to come, and he was thirsty besides, with the sun beating down upon his head. So then, suddenly, his daughter would leap out, as though from a beleaguered city, would make a sortie, turn the street corner, and, having risked her life a hundred times over, reappear and bring us, with a jug of liquorice-water, the news that there were still at least a thousand of them, pouring along without a break from the direction of Thiberzy and M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise. Fran\\u00e7oise and the gardener, having \\\\'made up\\\\' their difference, would discuss the line to be followed in case of war.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Don\\\\'t you see, Fran\\u00e7oise,\\\" he would say. \\\"Revolution would be better, because then no one would need to join in unless he liked.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Oh, yes, I can see that, certainly; it\\\\'s more straightforward.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The gardener believed that, as soon as war was declared, they would stop all the railways.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Yes, to be sure; so that we sha\\\\'n\\\\'t get away,\\\" said Fran\\u00e7oise.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And the gardener would assent, with \\\"Ay, they\\\\'re the cunning ones,\\\" for he would not allow that war was anything but a kind of trick which the state attempted to play on the people, or that there was a man in the world who would not run away from it if he had the chance to do so.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0But Fran\\u00e7oise would hasten back to my aunt, and I would return to my book, and the servants would take their places again outside the gate to watch the dust settle on the pavement, and the excitement caused by the passage of the soldiers subside. Long after order had been restored, an abnormal tide of humanity would continue to darken the streets of Corn-bray. And in front of every house, even of those where it was not, as a rule, \\\\'done,\\\\' the servants, and sometimes even the masters would sit and stare, festooning their doorsteps with a dark, irregular fringe, like the border of shells and sea-weed which a stronger tide than usual leaves on the beach, as though trimming it with embroidered crape, when the sea itself has retreated.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Except on such days as these, however, I would as a rule be left to read in peace. But the interruption which a visit from Swann once made, and the commentary which he then supplied to the course of my reading, which had brought me to the work of an author quite new to me, called Bergotte, had this definite result that for a long time afterwards it was not against a wall gay with spikes of purple blossom, but on a wholly different background, the porch of a gothic cathedral, that I would see outlined the figure of one of the women of whom I dreamed.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0I had heard Bergotte spoken of, for the first time, by a friend older than myself, for whom I had a strong admiration, a precious youth of the name of Bloch. Hearing me confess my love of the Nuit d\\\\'Octobre, he had burst out in a bray of laughter, like a bugle-call, and told me, by way of warning: \\\"You must conquer your vile taste for A. de Musset, Esquire. He is a bad egg, one of the very worst, a pretty detestable specimen. I am bound to admit, natheless,\\\" he added graciously, \\\"that he, and even the man Racine, did, each of them, once in his life, compose a line which is not only fairly rhythmical, but has also what is in my eyes the supreme merit of meaning absolutely nothing. One is  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0La blanche Oloossone et la blanche Camire  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And the other  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0La fille de Minos et de Pasipha\\u00eb.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0They were submitted to my judgment, as evidence for the defence of the two runagates, in an article by my very dear master Father Lecomte, who is found pleasing in the sight of the immortal gods. By which token, here is a book which I have not the time, just now, to read, a book recommended, it would seem, by that colossal fellow. He regards, or so they tell me, its author, one Bergotte, Esquire, as a subtle scribe, more subtle, indeed, than any beast of the field; and, albeit he exhibits on occasion a critical pacifism, a tenderness in suffering fools, for which it is impossible to account, and hard to make allowance, still his word has weight with me as it were the Delphic Oracle. Read you then this lyrical prose, and, if the Titanic master-builder of rhythm who composed Bhagavat and the L\\u00e9vrier de Magnus speaks not falsely, then, by Apollo, you may taste, even you, my master, the ambrosial joys of Olympus.\\\" It was in an ostensible vein of sarcasm that he had asked me to call him, and that he himself called me, \\\"my master.\\\" But, as a matter of fact, we each derived a certain amount of satisfaction from the mannerism, being still at the age in which one believes that one gives a thing real existence by giving it a name.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Unfortunately I was not able to set at rest, by further talks with Bloch, in which I might have insisted upon an explanation, the doubts he had engendered in me when he told me that fine lines of poetry from which I, if you please, expected nothing less than the revelation of truth itself were all the finer if they meant absolutely nothing. For, as it happened, Bloch was not invited to the house again. At first, he had been well received there. It is true that my grandfather made out that, whenever I formed a strong attachment to any one of my friends and brought him home with me, that friend was invariably a Jew; to which he would not have objected on principle\\u2014indeed his own friend Swann was of Jewish extraction\\u2014had he not found that the Jews whom I chose as friends were not usually of the best type. And so I was hardly ever able to bring a new friend home without my grandfather\\\\'s humming the \\\"O, God of our fathers\\\" from La Juive, or else \\\"Israel, break thy chain,\\\" singing the tune alone, of course, to an \\\"um-ti-tum-ti-tum, tra-la\\\"; but I used to be afraid of my friend\\\\'s recognising the sound, and so being able to reconstruct the words.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Before seeing them, merely on hearing their names, about which, as often as not, there was nothing particularly Hebraic, he would divine not only the Jewish origin of such of my friends as might indeed be of the chosen people, but even some dark secret which was hidden in their family.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"And what do they call your friend who is coming this evening?\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Dumont, grandpapa.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Dumont! Oh, I\\\\'m frightened of Dumont.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And he would sing:  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0  Archers, be on your guard! \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Watch without rest, without sound.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And then, after a few adroit questions on points of detail, he would call out \\\"On guard! on guard,\\\" or, if it were the victim himself who had already arrived, and had been obliged, unconsciously, by my grandfather\\\\'s subtle examination, to admit his origin, then my grandfather, to shew us that he had no longer any doubts, would merely look at us, humming almost inaudibly the air of  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0  What! do you hither guide the feet \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Of this timid Israelite?  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Or of  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Sweet vale of Hebron, dear paternal fields  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Or, perhaps, of  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Yes, I am of the chosen race  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0These little eccentricities on my grandfather\\\\'s part implied no ill-will whatsoever towards my friends. But Bloch had displeased my family for other reasons. He had begun by annoying my father, who, seeing him come in with wet clothes, had asked him with keen interest:  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Why, M. Bloch, is there a change in the weather; has it been raining? I can\\\\'t understand it; the barometer has been \\\\'set fair.\\\\'\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Which drew from Bloch nothing more instructive than \\\"Sir, I am absolutely incapable of telling you whether it has rained. I live so resolutely apart from physical contingencies that my senses no longer trouble to inform me of them.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"My poor boy,\\\" said my father after Bloch had gone, \\\"your friend is out of his mind. Why, he couldn\\\\'t even tell me what the weather was like. As if there could be anything more interesting! He is an imbecile.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Next, Bloch had displeased my grandmother because, after luncheon, when she complained of not feeling very well, he had stifled a sob and wiped the tears from his eyes.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"You cannot imagine that he is sincere,\\\" she observed to me. \\\"Why he doesn\\\\'t know me. Unless he\\\\'s mad, of course.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And finally he had upset the whole household when he arrived an hour and a half late for luncheon and covered with mud from head to foot, and made not the least apology, saying merely: \\\"I never allow myself to be influenced in the smallest degree either by atmospheric disturbances or by the arbitrary divisions of what is known as Time. I would willingly reintroduce to society the opium pipe of China or the Malayan kriss, but I am wholly and entirely without instruction in those infinitely more pernicious besides being quite bleakly bourgeois implements, the umbrella and the watch.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0In spite of all this he would still have been received at Combray. He was, of course, hardly the friend my parents would have chosen for me; they had, in the end, decided that the tears which he had shed on hearing of my grandmother\\\\'s illness were genuine enough; but they knew, either instinctively or from their own experience, that our early impulsive emotions have but little influence over our later actions and the conduct of our lives; and that regard for moral obligations, loyalty to our friends, patience in finishing our work, obedience to a rule of life, have a surer foundation in habits solidly formed and blindly followed than in these momentary transports, ardent but sterile. They would have preferred to Bloch, as companions for myself, boys who would have given me no more than it is proper, by all the laws of middle-class morality, for boys to give one another, who would not unexpectedly send me a basket of fruit because they happened, that morning, to have thought of me with affection, but who, since they were incapable of inclining in my favour, by any single impulse of their imagination and emotions, the exact balance of the duties and claims of friendship, were as incapable of loading the scales to my prejudice. Even the injuries we do them will not easily divert from the path of their duty towards us those conventional natures of which my great-aunt furnished a type: who, after quarrelling for years with a niece, to whom she never spoke again, yet made no change in the will in which she had left that niece the whole of her fortune, because she was her next-of-kin, and it was the \\\\'proper thing\\\\' to do.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0But I was fond of Bloch; my parents wished me to be happy; and the insoluble problems which I set myself on such texts as the \\\\'absolutely meaningless\\\\' beauty of La fille de Minos et de Pasipha\\u00ebtired me more and made me more unwell than I should have been after further talks with him, unwholesome as those talks might seem to my mother\\\\'s mind. And he would still have been received at Combray but for one thing. That same night, after dinner, having informed me a piece of news which had a great influence on my later life, making it happier at one time and then more unhappy that no woman ever thought of anything but love, and that there was not one of them whose resistance a man could not overcome, he had gone on to assure me that he had heard it said on unimpeachable authority that my great-aunt herself had led a \\\\'gay\\\\' life in her younger days, and had been notoriously \\\\'kept.\\\\' I could not refrain from passing on so important a piece of information to my parents; the next time Bloch called he was not admitted, and afterwards, when I met him in the street, he greeted me with extreme coldness.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0But in the matter of Bergotte he had spoken truly.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0For the first few days, like a tune which will be running in one\\\\'s head and maddening one soon enough, but of which one has not for the moment \\\\'got hold,\\\\' the things I was to love so passionately in Bergotte\\\\'s style had not yet caught my eye. I could not, it is true, lay down the novel of his which I was reading, but I fancied that I was interested in the story alone, as in the first dawn of love, when we go every day to meet a woman at some party or entertainment by the charm of which we imagine it is that we are attracted. Then I observed the rare, almost archaic phrases which he liked to employ at certain points, where a hidden flow of harmony, a prelude contained and concealed in the work itself would animate and elevate his style; and it was at such points as these, too, that he would begin to speak of the \\\"vain dream of life,\\\" of the \\\"inexhaustible torrent of fair forms,\\\" of the \\\"sterile, splendid torture of understanding and loving,\\\" of the \\\"moving effigies which ennoble for all time the charming and venerable fronts of our cathedrals\\\"; that he would express a whole system of philosophy, new to me, by the use of marvellous imagery, to the inspiration of which I would naturally have ascribed that sound of harping which began to chime and echo in my ears, an accompaniment to which that imagery added something ethereal and sublime. One of these passages of Bergotte, the third or fourth which I had detached from the rest, filled me with a joy to which the meagre joy I had tasted in the first passage bore no comparison, a joy which I felt myself to have experienced in some innermost chamber of my soul, deep, undivided, vast, from which all obstructions and partitions seemed to have been swept away. For what had happened was that, while I recognised in this passage the same taste for uncommon phrases, the same bursts of music, the same idealist philosophy which had been present in the earlier passages without my having taken them into account as the source of my pleasure, I now no longer had the impression of being confronted by a particular passage in one of Bergotte\\\\'s works, which traced a purely bi-dimensional figure in outline upon the surface of my mind, but rather of the \\\\'ideal passage\\\\' of Bergotte, common to every one of his books, and to which all the earlier, similar passages, now becoming merged in it, had added a kind of density and volume, by which my own understanding seemed to be enlarged.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0I was by no means Bergotte\\\\'s sole admirer; he was the favourite writer also of a friend of my mother\\\\'s, a highly literary lady; while Dr. du Boulbon had kept all his patients waiting until he finished Bergotte\\\\'s latest volume; and it was from his consulting room, and from a house in a park near Combray that some of the first seeds were scattered of that taste for Bergotte, a rare-growth in those days, but now so universally acclimatised that one finds it flowering everywhere throughout Europe and America, and even in the tiniest villages, rare still in its refinement, but in that alone. What my mother\\\\'s friend, and, it would seem, what Dr. du Boulbon liked above all in the writings of Bergotte was just what I liked, the same flow of melody, the same old-fashioned phrases, and certain others, quite simple and familiar, but so placed by him, in such prominence, as to hint at a particular quality of taste on his part; and also, in the sad parts of his books, a sort of roughness, a tone that was almost harsh. And he himself, no doubt, realised that these were his principal attractions. For in his later books, if he had hit upon some great truth, or upon the name of an historic cathedral, he would break off his narrative, and in an invocation, an apostrophe, a lengthy prayer, would give a free outlet to that effluence which, in the earlier volumes, remained buried beneath the form of his prose, discernible only in a rippling of its surface, and perhaps even more delightful, more harmonious when it was thus veiled from the eye, when the reader could give no precise indication of where the murmur of the current began, or of where it died away. These passages in which he delighted were our favourites also. For my own part I knew all of them by heart. I felt even disappointed when he resumed the thread of his narrative. Whenever he spoke of something whose beauty had until then remained hidden from me, of pine-forests or of hailstorms, of Notre-Dame de Paris, of Athalie, or of Ph\\u00e8dre, by some piece of imagery he would make their beauty explode and drench me with its essence. And so, dimly realising that the uni contained innumerable elements which my feeble senses would be powerless to discern, did he not bring them within my reach, I wished that I might have his opinion, some metaphor of his, upon everything in the world, and especially upon such things as I might have an opportunity, some day, of seeing for myself; and among such things, more particularly still upon some of the historic buildings of France, upon certain views of the sea, because the emphasis with which, in his books, he referred to these shewed that he regarded them as rich in significance and beauty. But, alas, upon almost everything in the world his opinion was unknown to me. I had no doubt that it would differ entirely from my own, since his came down from an unknown sphere towards which I was striving to raise myself; convinced that my thoughts would have seemed pure foolishness to that perfected spirit, I had so completely obliterated them all that, if I happened to find in one of his books something which had already occurred to my own mind, my heart would swell with gratitude and pride as though some deity had, in his infinite bounty, restored it to me, had pronounced it to be beautiful and right. It happened now and then that a page of Bergotte would express precisely those ideas which I used often at night, when I was unable to sleep, to write to my grandmother and mother, and so concisely and well that his page had the appearance of a collection of mottoes for me to set at the head of my letters. And so too, in later years, when I began to compose a book of my own, and the quality of some of my sentences seemed so inadequate that I could not make up my mind to go on with the undertaking, I would find the equivalent of my sentences in Bergotte\\\\'s. But it was only then, when I read them in his pages, that I could enjoy them; when it was I myself who composed them, in my anxiety that they should exactly reproduce what I seemed to have detected in my mind, and in my fear of their not turning out \\\\'true to life,\\\\' I had no time to ask myself whether what I was writing would be pleasant to read! But indeed there was no kind of language, no kind of ideas which I really liked, except these. My feverish and unsatisfactory attempts were themselves a token of my love, a love which brought me no pleasure, but was, for all that, intense and deep. And so, when I came suddenly upon similar phrases in the writings of another, that is to say stripped of their familiar accompaniment of scruples and repressions and self-tormentings, I was free to indulge to the full my own appetite for such things, just as a cook who, once in a while, has no dinner to prepare for other people, can then find time to gormandise himself. And so, when I had found, one day, in a book by Bergotte, some joke about an old family servant, to which his solemn and magnificent style added a great deal of irony, but which was in principle what I had often said to my grandmother about Fran\\u00e7oise, and when, another time, I had discovered that he thought not unworthy of reflection in one of those mirrors of absolute Truth which were his writings, a remark similar to one which I had had occasion to make on our friend M. Legrandin and, moreover, my remarks on Fran\\u00e7oise and M. Legrandin were among those which I would most resolutely have sacrificed for Bergotte\\\\'s sake, in the belief that he would find them quite without interest; then it was suddenly revealed to me that my own humble existence and the Realms of Truth were less widely separated than I had supposed, that at certain points they were actually in contact; and in my new-found confidence and joy I wept upon his printed page, as in the arms of a long-lost father.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0From his books I had formed an impression of Bergotte as a frail and disappointed old man, who had lost his children, and had never found any consolation. And so I would read, or rather sing his sentences in my brain, with rather more dolce, rather more lento than he himself had, perhaps, intended, and his simplest phrase would strike my ears with something peculiarly gentle and loving in its intonation. More than anything else in the world I cherished his philosophy, and had pledged myself to it in lifelong devotion. It made me impatient to reach the age when I should be eligible to attend the class at school called \\\\'Philosophy.\\\\' I did not wish to learn or do anything else there, but simply to exist and be guided entirely by the mind of Bergotte, and, if I had been told then that the metaphysicians whom I was actually to follow there resembled him in nothing, I should have been struck down by the despair a young lover feels who has sworn lifelong fidelity, when a friend speaks to him of the other mistresses he will have in time to come.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0One Sunday, while I was reading in the garden, I was interrupted by Swann, who had come to call upon my parents.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"What are you reading? May I look? Why, it\\\\'s Bergotte! Who has been telling you about him?\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0I replied that Bloch was responsible.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Oh, yes, that boy I saw here once, who looks so like the Bellini portrait of Mahomet II. It\\\\'s an astonishing likeness; he has the same arched eyebrows and hooked nose and prominent cheekbones. When his beard comes he\\\\'ll be Mahomet himself. Anyhow he has good taste, for Bergotte is a charming creature.\\\" And seeing how much I seemed to admire Bergotte, Swann, who never spoke at all about the people he knew, made an exception in my favour and said: \\\"I know him well; if you would like him to write a few words on the title-page of your book I could ask him for you.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0I dared not accept such an offer, but bombarded Swann with questions about his friend. \\\"Can you tell me, please, who is his favourite actor?\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Actor? No, I can\\\\'t say. But I do know this: there\\\\'s not a man on the stage whom he thinks equal to Berma; he puts her above everyone. Have you seen her?\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"No, sir, my parents do not allow me to go to the theatre.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"That is a pity. You should insist. Berma in Ph\\u00e8dre, in the Cid; well, she\\\\'s only an actress, if you like, but you know that I don\\\\'t believe very much in the \\\\'hierarchy\\\\' of the arts.\\\" As he spoke I noticed, what had often struck me before in his conversations with my grandmother\\\\'s sisters, that whenever he spoke of serious matters, whenever he used an expression which seemed to imply a definite opinion upon some important subject, he would take care to isolate, to sterilise it by using a special intonation, mechanical and ironic, as though he had put the phrase or word between inverted commas, and was anxious to disclaim any personal responsibility for it; as who should say \\\"the \\\\'hierarchy,\\\\' don\\\\'t you know, as silly people call it.\\\" But then, if it was so absurd, why did he say the \\\\'hierarchy\\\\'? A moment later he went on: \\\"Her acting will give you as noble an inspiration as any masterpiece of art in the world, as\\u2014oh, I don\\\\'t know\\u2014\\\" and he began to laugh, \\\"shall we say the Queens of Chartres?\\\" Until then I had supposed that his horror of having to give a serious opinion was something Parisian and refined, in contrast to the provincial dogmatism of my grandmother\\\\'s sisters; and I had imagined also that it was characteristic of the mental attitude towards life of the circle in which Swann moved, where, by a natural reaction from the \\\\'lyrical\\\\' enthusiasms of earlier generations, an excessive importance was given to small and precise facts, formerly regarded as vulgar, and anything in the nature of \\\\'phrase-making\\\\' was banned. But now I found myself slightly shocked by this attitude which Swann invariably adopted when face to face with generalities. He appeared unwilling to risk even having an opinion, and to be at his ease only when he could furnish, with meticulous accuracy, some precise but unimportant detail. But in so doing he did not take into account that even here he was giving an opinion, holding a brief as they say for something, that the accuracy of his details had an importance of its own. I thought again of the dinner that night, when I had been so unhappy because Mamma would not be coming up to my room, and when he had dismissed the balls given by the Princesse de L\\u00e9on as being of no importance. And yet it was to just that sort of amusement that he was devoting his life. For what other kind of existence did he reserve the duties of saying in all seriousness what he thought about things, of formulating judgments which he would not put between inverted commas; and when would he cease to give himself up to occupations of which at the same, time he made out that they were absurd? I noticed, too, in the manner in which Swann spoke to me of Bergotte, something which, to do him justice, was not peculiar to himself, but was shared by all that writer\\\\'s admirers at that time, at least by my mother\\\\'s friend and by Dr. du Boulbon. Like Swann, they would say of Bergotte: \\\"He has a charming mind, so individual, he has a way of his own of saying things, which is a little far-fetched, but so pleasant. You never need to look for his name on the title-page, you can tell his work at once.\\\" But none of them had yet gone so far as to say \\\"He is a great writer, he has great talent.\\\" They did not even credit him with talent at all. They did not speak, because they were not aware of it. We are very slow in recognising in the peculiar physiognomy of a new writer the type which is labelled \\\\'great talent\\\\' in our museum of general ideas. Simply because that physiognomy is new and strange, we can find in it no resemblance to what we are accustomed to call talent. We say rather originality, charm, delicacy, strength; and then one day we add up the sum of these, and find that it amounts simply to talent.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Are there any books in which Bergotte has written about Berma?\\\" I asked M. Swann.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"I think he has, in that little essay on Racine, but it must be out of print. Still, there has perhaps been a second impression. I will find out. Anyhow, I can ask Bergotte himself all that you want to know next time he comes to dine with us. He never misses a week, from one year\\\\'s end to another. He is my daughter\\\\'s greatest friend. They go about together, and look at old towns and cathedrals and castles.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0As I was still completely ignorant of the different grades in the social hierarchy, the fact that my father found it impossible for us to see anything of Swann\\\\'s wife and daughter had, for a long time, had the contrary effect of making me imagine them as separated from us by an enormous gulf, which greatly enhanced their dignity and importance in my eyes. I was sorry that my mother did not dye her hair and redden her lips, as I had heard our neighbour, Mme. Sazerat, say that Mme. Swann did, to gratify not her husband but M. de Charlus; and I felt that, to her, we must be an object of scorn, which distressed me particularly on account of the daughter, such a pretty little girl, as I had heard, and one of whom I used often to dream, always imagining her with the same features and appearance, which I bestowed upon her quite arbitrarily, but with a charming effect. But from this afternoon, when I had learned that Mile. Swann was a creature living in such rare and fortunate circumstances, bathed, as in her natural element, in such a sea of privilege that, if she should ask her parents whether anyone were coming to dinner, she would be answered in those two syllables, radiant with celestial light, would hear the name of that golden guest who was to her no more than an old friend of her family, Bergotte; that for her the intimate conversation at table, corresponding to what my great-aunt\\\\'s conversation was for me, would be the words of Bergotte upon all those subjects which he had not been able to take up in his writings, and on which I would fain have heard him utter oracles; and that, above all, when she went to visit other towns, he would be walking by her side, unrecognised and glorious, like the gods who came down, of old, from heaven to dwell among mortal men: then I realised both the rare worth of a creature such as Mile. Swann, and, at the same time, how coarse and ignorant I should appear to her; and I felt so keenly how pleasant and yet how impossible it would be for me to become her friend that I was filled at once with longing and with despair. And usually, from this time forth, when I thought of her, I would see her standing before the porch of a cathedral, explaining to me what each of the statues meant, and, with a smile which was my highest commendation, presenting me, as her friend, to Bergotte. And invariably the charm of all the fancies which the thought of cathedrals used to inspire in me, the charm of the hills and valleys of the He de France and of the plains of Normandy, would radiate brightness and beauty over the picture I had formed in my mind of Mile. Swann; nothing more remained but to know and to love her. Once we believe that a fellow-creature has a share in some unknown existence to which that creature\\\\'s love for ourselves can win us admission, that is, of all the preliminary conditions which Love exacts, the one to which he attaches most importance, the one which makes him generous or indifferent as to the rest. Even those women who pretend that they judge a man by his exterior only, see in that exterior an emanation from some special way of life. And that is why they fall in love with a soldier or a fireman, whose uniform makes them less particular about his face; they kiss and believe that beneath the crushing breastplate there beats a heart different from the rest, more gallant, more adventurous, more tender; and so it is that a young king or a crown prince may travel in foreign countries and make the most gratifying conquests, and yet lack entirely that regular and classic profile which would be indispensable, I dare say, in an outside-broker.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0While I was reading in the garden, a thing my great-aunt would never have understood my doing save on a Sunday, that being the day on which it was unlawful to indulge in any serious occupation, and on which she herself would lay aside her sewing on a week-day she would have said, \\\"How you can go on amusing yourself with a book; it isn\\\\'t Sunday, you know!\\\" putting into the word \\\\'amusing\\\\' an implication of childishness and waste of time, my aunt L\\u00e9onie would be gossiping with Fran\\u00e7oise until it was time for Eulalie to arrive. She would tell her that she had just seen Mme. Goupil go by \\\"without an umbrella, in the silk dress she had made for her the other day at Ch\\u00e2teaudun. If she has far to go before vespers, she may get it properly soaked.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Very likely\\\" which meant also \\\"very likely not\\\" was the answer, for Fran\\u00e7oise did not wish definitely to exclude the possibility of a happier alternative  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"There, now,\\\" went on my aunt, beating her brow, \\\"that reminds me that I never heard if she got to church this morning before the Elevation. I must remember to ask Eulalie... Fran\\u00e7oise, just look at that black cloud behind the steeple, and how poor the light is on the slates, you may be certain it will rain before the day is out. It couldn\\\\'t possibly keep on like this, it\\\\'s been too hot. And the sooner the better, for until the storm breaks my Vichy water won\\\\'t \\\\'go down,\\\\'\\\" she concluded, since, in her mind, the desire to accelerate the digestion of her Vichy water was of infinitely greater importance than her fear of seeing Mme. Goupil\\\\'s new dress ruined.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Very likely.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"And you know that when it rains in the Square there\\\\'s none too much shelter.\\\" Suddenly my aunt turned pale. \\\"What, three o\\\\'clock!\\\" she exclaimed. \\\"But vespers will have begun already, and I\\\\'ve forgotten my pepsin! Now I know why that Vichy water has been lying on my stomach.\\\" And falling precipitately upon a prayer-book bound in purple velvet, with gilt clasps, out of which in her haste she let fall a shower of the little pictures, each in a lace fringe of yellowish paper, which she used to mark the places of the greater feasts of the church, my aunt, while she swallowed her drops, began at full speed to mutter the words of the sacred text, its meaning being slightly clouded in her brain by the uncertainty whether the pepsin, when taken so long after the Vichy, would still be able to overtake it and to \\\\'send it down.\\\\' \\\"Three o\\\\'clock! It\\\\'s unbelievable how time flies.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0A little tap at the window, as though some missile had struck it, followed by a plentiful, falling sound, as light, though, as if a shower of sand were being sprinkled from a window overhead; then the fall spread, took on an order, a rhythm, became liquid, loud, drumming, musical, innumerable, universal. It was the rain.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"There, Fran\\u00e7oise, what did I tell you? How it\\\\'s coming down! But I think I heard the bell at the garden gate: go along and see who can be outside in this weather.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Fran\\u00e7oise went and returned. \\\"It\\\\'s Mme. Am\\u00e9d\\u00e9e\\\" my grandmother. \\\"She said she was going for a walk. It\\\\'s raining hard, all the same.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"I\\\\'m not at all surprised,\\\" said my aunt, looking up towards the sky. \\\"I\\\\'ve always said that she was not in the least like other people. Well, I\\\\'m glad it\\\\'s she and not myself who\\\\'s outside in all this.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Mme. Am\\u00e9d\\u00e9e is always the exact opposite of the rest,\\\" said Fran\\u00e7oise, not unkindly, refraining until she should be alone with the other servants from stating her belief that my grandmother was \\\\'a bit off her head.\\\\'  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"There\\\\'s Benediction over! Eulalie will never come now,\\\" sighed my aunt. \\\"It will be the weather that\\\\'s frightened her away.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"But it\\\\'s not five o\\\\'clock yet, Mme. Octave, it\\\\'s only half-past four.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Only half-past four! And here am I, obliged to draw back the small curtains, just to get a tiny streak of daylight. At half-past four! Only a week before the Rogation-days. Ah, my poor Fran\\u00e7oise, the dear Lord must be sorely vexed with us. The world is going too far in these days. As my poor Octave used to say, we have forgotten God too often, and He is taking vengeance upon us.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0A bright flush animated my aunt\\\\'s cheeks; it was Eulalie. As ill luck would have it, scarcely had she been admitted to the presence when Fran\\u00e7oise reappeared and, with a smile which was meant to indicate her full participation in the pleasure which, she had no doubt, her tidings would give my aunt, articulating each syllable so as to shew that, in spite of her having to translate them into indirect speech, she was repeating, as a good servant should, the very words which the new visitor had condescended to use, said: \\\"His reverence the Cur\\u00e9 would be delighted, enchanted, if Mme. Octave is not resting just now, and could see him. His reverence does not wish to disturb Mme. Octave. His reverence is downstairs; I told him to go into the parlour.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Had the truth been known, the Cur\\u00e9\\\\'s visits gave my aunt no such ecstatic pleasure as Fran\\u00e7oise supposed, and the air of jubilation with which she felt bound to illuminate her face whenever she had to announce his arrival, did not altogether correspond to what was felt by her invalid. The Cur\\u00e9 an excellent man, with whom I am sorry now that I did not con more often, for, even if he cared nothing for the arts, he knew a great many etymologies, being in the habit of shewing distinguished visitors over his church he had even planned to compile a history of the Parish of Com-bray, used to weary her with his endless explanations, which, incidentally, never varied in the least degree. But when his visit synchronized exactly with Eulalie\\\\'s it became frankly distasteful to my aunt. She would have preferred to make the most of Eulalie, and not to have had the whole of her circle about her at one time. But she dared not send the Cur\\u00e9 away, and had to content herself with making a sign to Eulalie not to leave when he did, so that she might have her to herself for a little after he had gone.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"What is this I have been hearing, Father, that a painter has set up his easel in your church, and is copying one of the windows? Old as I am, I can safely say that I have never even heard of such a thing in all my life! What is the world coming to next, I wonder! And the ugliest thing in the whole church, too.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"I will not go so far as to say that it is quite the ugliest, for, although there are certain things in Saint-Hilaire which are well worth a visit, there are others that are very old now, in my poor basilica, the only one in all the diocese that has never even been restored. The Lord knows, our porch is dirty and out of date; still, it is of a majestic character; take, for instance, the Esther tapestries, though personally I would not give a brass farthing for the pair of them, but experts put them next after the ones at Sens. I can quite see, too, that apart from certain details which are\\u2014well, a trifle realistic, they shew features which testify to a genuine power of observation. But don\\\\'t talk to me about the windows. Is it common sense, I ask you, to leave up windows which shut out all the daylight, and even confuse the eyes by throwing patches of colour, to which I should be hard put to it to give a name, on a floor in which there are not two slabs on the same level? And yet they refuse to renew the floor for me because, if you please, those are the tombstones of the Abbots of Combray and the Lords of Guermantes, the old Counts, you know, of Brabant, direct ancestors of the present Duc de Guermantes, and of his Duchesse also, since she was a lady of the Guermantes family, and married her cousin.\\\" My grandmother, whose steady refusal to take any interest in \\\\'persons\\\\' had ended in her confusing all their names and titles, whenever anyone mentioned the Duchesse de Guermantes used to make out that she must be related to Mme. de Villeparisis. The whole family would then burst out laughing; and she would attempt to justify herself by harking back to some invitation to a christening or funeral: \\\"I feel sure that there was a Guermantes in it somewhere.\\\" And for once I would side with the others, and against her, refusing to admit that there could be any connection between her school-friend and the descendant of Genevi\\u00e8ve de Brabant.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Look at Roussainville,\\\" the Cur\\u00e9 went on. \\\"It is nothing more nowadays than a parish of farmers, though in olden times the place must have had a considerable importance from its trade in felt hats and clocks. I am not certain, by the way, of the etymology of Roussainville. I should dearly like to think that the name was originally Rouville, from Radulfi villa, analogous, don\\\\'t you see, to Ch\\u00e2teauroux,Castrum Radulfi, but we will talk about that some other time. Very well; the church there has superb windows, almost all quite modern, including that most imposing \\\\'Entry of Louis-Philippe into Combray\\\\' which would be more in keeping, surely, at Combray itself, and which is every bit as good, I understand, as the famous^windows at Chartres. Only yesterday I met Dr. Percepied\\\\'s brother, who goes in for these things, and he told me that he looked upon it as a most beautiful piece of work. But, as I said to this artist, who, by the way, seems to be a most civil fellow, and is a regular virtuoso, it appears, with his brush; what on earth, I said to him, do you find so extraordinary in this window, which is, if anything, a little dingier than the rest?\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"I am sure that if you were to ask his Lordship,\\\" said my aunt in a resigned tone, for she had begun to feel that she was going to be \\\\'tired,\\\\' \\\"he would never refuse you a new window.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"You may depend upon it, Mme. Octave,\\\" replied the Cur\\u00e9. \\\"Why, it was just his Lordship himself who started the outcry about the window, by proving that it represented Gilbert the Bad, a Lord of Guermantes and a direct descendant of Genevi\\u00e8ve de Brabant, who was a daughter of the House of Guermantes, receiving absolution from Saint Hilaire.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"But I don\\\\'t see where Saint Hilaire comes in.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Why yes, have you never noticed, in the corner of the window, a lady in a yellow robe? Very well, that is Saint Hilaire, who is also known, you will remember, in certain parts of the country as Saint Illiers, Saint H\\u00e8lier, and even, in the Jura, Saint Ylie. But these various corruptions of Sanctus Hilarius are by no means the most curious that have occurred in the names of the blessed Saints. Take, for example, my good Eulalie, the case of your own patron, Sancta Eulalia; do you know what she has become in Burgundy? Saint Eloi, nothing more nor less! The lady has become a gentleman. Do you hear that, Eulalie, after you are dead they will make a man of you!\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Father will always have his joke.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Gilbert\\\\'s brother, Charles the Stammerer, was a pious prince, but, having early in life lost his father, Pepin the Mad, who died as a result of his mental infirmity, he wielded the supreme power with all the arrogance of a man who has not been subjected to discipline in his youth, so much so that, whenever he saw a man in a town whose face he did not remember, he would massacre the whole place, to the last inhabitant. Gilbert, wishing to be avenged on Charles, caused the church at Combray to be burned down, the original church, that was, which Th\\u00e9odebert, when he and his court left the country residence he had near here, at Thiberzy which is, of course, Theodeberiacus, to go out and fight the Burgundians, had promised to build over the tomb of Saint Hilaire if the Saint brought him; victory. Nothing remains of it now but the crypt, into which Th\\u00e9odore has probably taken you, for Gilbert burned all the rest. Finally, he defeated the unlucky Charles with the aid of William\\\" which the Cur\\u00e9 pronounced \\\"Will\\\\'am\\\" \\\"the Conqueror, which is why so many English still come to visit the place. But he does not appear to have managed to win the affection of the people of Combray, for they fell upon him as he was coming out from mass, and cut off his head. Th\\u00e9odore has a little book, that he lends people, which tells you the whole story.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"But what is unquestionably the most remarkable thing about our church is the view from the belfry, which is full of grandeur. Certainly in your case, since you are not very strong, I should never recommend you: to climb our seven and ninety steps, just half the number they have in the famous cathedral at Milan. It is quite tiring enough for the most active person, especially as you have to go on your hands and knees, if you don\\\\'t wish to crack your skull, and you collect all the cobwebs off the staircase upon your clothes. In any case you should be well wrapped up,\\\" he went on, without noticing my aunt\\\\'s fury at the mere suggestion that she could ever, possibly, be capable of climbing into his belfry, \\\"for there\\\\'s a strong breeze there, once you get to the top. Some people even assure me that they have felt the chill of death up there. No matter, on Sundays there are always clubs and societies, who come, some of them, long distances to admire our beautiful panorama, and they always go home charmed. Wait now, next Sunday, if the weather holds, you will be sure to find a lot of people there, for Rogation-tide. You must admit, certainly, that the view from up there is like a fairy-tale, with what you might call vistas along the plain, which have quite a special charm of their own. On a clear day you can see as far as Verneuil. And then another thing; you can see at the same time places which you are in the habit of seeing one without the other, as, for instance, the course of the Vivonne and the ditches at Saint-Assise-l\\u00e8s-Combray, which are separated, really, by a screen of tall trees; or, to take another example, there are all the canals at Jouy-le-Vicomte, which is Gaudiacus vicecomitis, as of course you know. Each time that I have been to Jouy I have seen a bit of a canal in one place, and then I have turned a corner and seen another, but when I saw the second I could no longer see the first. I tried in vain to imagine how they lay by one another; it was no good. But, from the top of Saint-Hilaire, it\\\\'s quite another matter; the whole countryside is spread out before you like a map. Only, you cannot make out the water; you would say that there were great rifts in the town, slicing it up so neatly that it looks like a loaf of bread which still holds together after it has been cut up. To get it all quite perfect you would have to be in both places at once; up here on the top of Saint-Hilaire and down there at Jouy-le-Vicomte.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The Cur\\u00e9 had so much exhausted my aunt that no sooner had he gone than she was obliged to send away Eulalie also  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Here, my poor Eulalie,\\\" she said in a feeble voice, drawing a coin from a small purse which lay ready to her hand. \\\"This is just something so that you shall not forget me in your prayers.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Oh, but, Mme. Octave, I don\\\\'t think I ought to; you know very well that I don\\\\'t come here for that!\\\" So Eulalie would answer, with the same hesitation and the same embarrassment, every Sunday, as though each temptation were the first, and with a look of displeasure which enlivened my aunt and never offended her, for if it so happened that Eulalie, when she took the money, looked a little less sulky than usual, my aunt would remark afterwards, \\\"I cannot think what has come over Eulalie; I gave her just the trifle I always give, and she did not look at all pleased.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"I don\\\\'t think she has very much to complain of, all the same,\\\" Fran\\u00e7oise would sigh grimly, for she had a tendency to regard as petty cash all that my aunt might give her for herself or her children, and as treasure riotously squandered on a pampered and ungrateful darling the little coins slipped, Sunday by Sunday, into Eulalie\\\\'s hand, but so discreetly passed that Fran\\u00e7oise never managed to see them. It was not that she wanted to have for herself the money my aunt bestowed on Eulalie. She already enjoyed a sufficiency of all that my aunt possessed, in the knowledge that the wealth of the mistress automatically ennobled and glorified the maid in the eyes of the world; and that she herself was conspicuous and worthy to be praised throughout Combray, Jouy-le-Vicomte, and other cities of men, on account of my aunt\\\\'s many farms, her frequent and prolonged visits from the Cur\\u00e9, and the astonishing number of bottles of Vichy water which she consumed. Fran\\u00e7oise was avaricious only for my aunt; had she had control over my aunt\\\\'s fortune which would have more than satisfied her highest ambition she would have guarded it from the assaults of strangers with a maternal ferocity. She would, however, have seen no great harm in what my aunt, whom she knew to be incurably generous, allowed herself to give away, had she given only to those who were already rich. Perhaps she felt that such persons, not being actually in need of my aunt\\\\'s presents, could not be suspected of simulating affection for her on that account. Besides, presents offered to persons of great wealth and position, such as Mme. Sazerat, M. Swann, M. Legrandin and Mme. Goupil, to persons of the \\\\'same class\\\\' as my aunt, and who would naturally \\\\'mix with her,\\\\' seemed to Fran\\u00e7oise to be included among the ornamental customs of that strange and brilliant life led by rich people, who hunted and shot, gave balls and paid visits, a life which she would contemplate with an admiring smile. But it was by no means the same thing if, for this princely exchange of courtesies, my aunt substituted mere charity, if her beneficiaries were of the class which Fran\\u00e7oise would label \\\"people like myself,\\\" or \\\"people no better than myself,\\\" people whom she despised even more if they did not address her always as \\\"Mme. Fran\\u00e7oise,\\\" just to shew that they considered themselves to be \\\\'not as good.\\\\' And when she saw that, despite all her warnings, my aunt continued to do exactly as she pleased, and to fling money away with both hands or so, at least, Fran\\u00e7oise believed on undeserving objects, she began to find that the presents she herself received from my aunt were very tiny compared to the imaginary riches squandered upon Eulalie, There was not, in the neighbourhood of Combray, a farm of such prosperity and importance that Fran\\u00e7oise doubted Eulalie\\\\'s ability to buy it, without thinking twice, out of the capital which her visits to my aunt had \\\\'brought in.\\\\' It must be added that Eulalie had formed an exactly similar estimate of the vast and secret hoards of Fran\\u00e7oise. So, every Sunday, after Eulalie had gone, Fran\\u00e7oise would mercilessly prophesy her coming downfall. She hated Eulalie, but was at the same time afraid of her, and so felt bound, when Eulalie was there, to \\\\'look pleasant.\\\\' But she would make up for that after the other\\\\'s departure; never, it is true, alluding to her by name, but hinting at her in Sibylline oracles, or in utterances of a comprehensive character, like those of Ecclesiastes, the Preacher, but so worded that their special application could not escape my aunt. After peering out at the side of the curtain to see whether Eulalie had shut the front-door behind her; \\\"Flatterers know how to make themselves welcome, and to gather up the crumbs; but have patience, have patience; our God is a jealous God, and one fine day He will be avenged upon them!\\\" she would declaim, with the sidelong, insinuating glance of Joash, thinking of Athaliah alone when he says that the  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0    prosperity \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Of wicked men runs like a torrent past \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And soon is spent  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0But on this memorable afternoon, when the Cur\\u00e9 had come as well, and by his interminable visit had drained my aunt\\\\'s strength, Fran\\u00e7oise followed Eulalie from the room, saying: \\\"Mme. Octave, I will leave you to rest; you look utterly tired out.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And my aunt answered her not a word, breathing a sigh so faint that it seemed it must prove her last, and lying there with closed eyes, as though already dead. But hardly had Fran\\u00e7oise arrived downstairs, when four peals of a bell, pulled with the utmost violence, reverberated through the house, and my aunt, sitting erect upon her bed, called out: \\\"Has Eulalie gone yet? Would you believe it; I forgot to ask her whether Mme. Goupil arrived in church before the Elevation. Run after her, quick!\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0But Fran\\u00e7oise returned alone, having failed to overtake Eulalie. \\\"It is most provoking,\\\" said my aunt, shaking her head. \\\"The one important thing that I had to ask her.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0In this way life went by for my aunt L\\u00e9onie, always the same, in the gentle uniformity of what she called, with a pretence of deprecation but with a deep tenderness, her \\\\'little jog-trot.\\\\' Respected by all and sundry, not merely in her own house, where every one of us, having learned the futility of recommending any healthier mode of life, had become gradually resigned to its observance, but in the village as well, where, three streets away, a tradesman who had to hammer nails into a packing-case would send first to Fran\\u00e7oise to make sure that my aunt was not \\\\'resting\\\\'\\u2014her \\\\'little jog-trot\\\\' was, none the less, brutally disturbed on one occasion in this same year. Like a fruit hidden among its leaves, which has grown and ripened unobserved by man, until it falls of its own accord, there came upon us one night the kitchen-maid\\\\'s confinement. Her pains were unbearable, and, as there was no midwife in Combray, Fran\\u00e7oise had to set off before dawn to fetch one from Thiberzy. My aunt was unable to \\\\'rest,\\\\' owing to the cries of the girl, and as Fran\\u00e7oise, though the distance was nothing, was very late in returning, her services were greatly missed. And so, in the course of the morning, my mother said to me: \\\"Run upstairs, and see if your aunt wants anything.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0I went into the first of her two rooms, and through the open door of the other saw my aunt lying on her side, asleep. I could hear her breathing, in what was almost distinguishable as a snore. I was just going to slip away when something, probably the sound of my entry, interrupted her sleep, and made it \\\\'change speed,\\\\' as they say of motorcars nowadays, for the music of her snore broke off for a second and began again on a lower note; then she awoke, and half turned her face, which I could see for the first time; a kind of horror was imprinted on it; plainly she had just escaped from some terrifying dream. She could not see me from where she was lying, and I stood there not knowing whether I ought to go forward or to retire; but all at once she seemed to return to a sense of reality, and to grasp the falsehood of the visions that had terrified her; a smile of joy, a pious act of thanksgiving to God, Who is pleased to grant that life shall be less cruel than our dreams, feebly illumined her face, and, with the habit she had formed of speaking to herself, half-aloud, when she thought herself alone, she murmured: \\\"The Lord be praised! We have nothing to disturb us here but the kitchen-maid\\\\'s baby. And I\\\\'ve been dreaming that my poor Octave had come back to life, and was trying to make me take a walk every day!\\\" She stretched out a hand towards her rosary, which was lying on the small table, but sleep was once again getting the mastery, and did not leave her the strength to reach it; she fell asleep, calm and contented, and I crept out of the room on tiptoe, without either her or anyone\\\\'s else ever knowing, from that day to this, what I had seen and heard  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0When I say that, apart from such rare happenings as this confinement, my aunt\\\\'s \\\\'little jog-trot\\\\' never underwent any variation, I do not include those variations which, repeated at regular intervals and in identical form, did no more, really, than print a sort of uniform pattern upon the greater uniformity of her life. So, for instance, every Saturday, as Fran\\u00e7oise had to go in the afternoon to market at Roussainville-le-Pin, the whole household would have to have luncheon an hour earlier. And my aunt had so thoroughly acquired the habit of this weekly exception to her general habits, that she clung to it as much as to the rest. She was so well \\\\'routined\\\\' to it, as Fran\\u00e7oise would say, that if, on a Saturday, she had had to wait for her luncheon until the regular hour, it would have \\\\'upset\\\\' her as much as if she had had, on an ordinary day, to put her luncheon forward to its Saturday time. Incidentally this acceleration of luncheon gave Saturday, for all of us, an individual character, kindly and rather attractive. At the moment when, ordinarily, there was still an hour to be lived through before meal-time sounded, we would all know that in a few seconds we should see the endives make their precocious appearance, followed by the special favour of an omelette, an unmerited steak. The return of this asymmetrical Saturday was one of those petty occurrences, intra-mural, localised, almost civic, which, in uneventful lives and stable orders of society, create a kind of national unity, and become the favourite theme for conversation, for pleasantries, for anecdotes which can be embroidered as the narrator pleases; it would have provided a nucleus, ready-made, for a legendary cycle, if any of us had had the epic mind. At daybreak, before we were dressed, without rhyme or reason, save for the pleasure of proving the strength of our solidarity, we would call to one another good-humoredly, cordially, patriotically, \\\"Hurry up; there\\\\'s no time to be lost; don\\\\'t forget, it\\\\'s Saturday!\\\" while my aunt, gossiping with Fran\\u00e7oise, and reflecting that the day would be even longer than usual, would say, \\\"You might cook them a nice bit of veal, seeing that it\\\\'s Saturday.\\\" If, at half-past ten, some one absent-mindedly pulled out a watch and said, \\\"I say, an hour-and-a-half still before luncheon,\\\" everyone else would be in ecstasies over being able to retort at once: \\\"Why, what are you thinking about? Have you for-gotten that it\\\\'s Saturday?\\\" And a quarter of an hour later we would still be laughing, and reminding ourselves to go up and tell aunt L\\u00e9onie about this absurd mistake, to amuse her. The very face of the sky appeared to undergo a change. After luncheon the sun, conscious that it was Saturday, would blaze an hour longer in the zenith, and when some one, thinking that we were late in starting for our walk, said, \\\"What, only two o\\\\'clock!\\\" feeling the heavy throb go by him of the twin strokes from the steeple of Saint-Hilaire which as a rule passed no one at that hour upon the highways, deserted for the midday meal or for the nap which follows it, or on the banks of the bright and ever-flowing stream, which even the angler had abandoned, and so slipped unaccompanied into the vacant sky, where only a few loitering clouds remained to greet them the whole family would respond in chorus: \\\"Why, you\\\\'re forgetting; we had luncheon an hour earlier; you know very well it\\\\'s Saturday.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The surprise of a \\\\'barbarian\\\\' for so we termed everyone who was not acquainted with Saturday\\\\'s special customs who had called at eleven o\\\\'clock to speak to my father, and had found us at table, was an event which used to cause Fran\\u00e7oise as much merriment as, perhaps, anything that had ever happened in her life. And if she found it amusing that the nonplussed visitor should not have known, beforehand, that we had our luncheon an hour earlier on Saturday, it was still more irresistibly funny that my father himself fully as she sympathised, from the bottom of her heart, with the rigid chauvinism which prompted him should never have dreamed that the barbarian could fail to be aware of so simple a matter, and so had replied, with no further enlightenment of the other\\\\'s surprise at seeing us already in the dining-room: \\\"You see, it\\\\'s Saturday.\\\" On reaching this point in the story, Fran\\u00e7oise would pause to wipe the tears of merriment from her eyes, and then, to add to her own enjoyment, would prolong the dialogue, inventing a further reply for the visitor to whom the word \\\\'Saturday\\\\' had conveyed nothing. And so far from our objecting to these interpolations, we would feel that the story was not yet long enough, and would rally her with: \\\"Oh, but surely he said something else as well. There was more than that, the first time you told it.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0My great-aunt herself would lay aside her work, and raise her head and look on at us over her glasses  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The day had yet another characteristic feature, namely, that during May we used to go out on Saturday evenings after dinner to the \\\\'Month of Mary\\\\' devotions  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0As we were liable, there, to meet M. Vinteuil, who held very strict views on \\\"the deplorable untidiness of young people, which seems to be encouraged in these days,\\\" my mother would first see that there was nothing out of order in my appearance, and then we would set out for the church. It was in these \\\\'Month of Mary\\\\' services that I can remember having first fallen in love with hawthorn-blossom. The hawthorn was not merely in the church, for there, holy ground as it was, we had all of us a right of entry; but, arranged upon the altar itself, inseparable from the mysteries in whose celebration it was playing a part, it thrust in among the tapers and the sacred vessels its rows of branches, tied to one another horizontally in a stiff, festal scheme of decoration; and they were made more lovely still by the scalloped outline of the dark leaves, over which were scattered in profusion, as over a bridal train, little clusters of buds of a dazzling whiteness. Though I dared not look at them save through my fingers, I could feel that the formal scheme was composed of living things, and that it was Nature herself who, by trimming the shape of the foliage, and by adding the crowning ornament of those snowy buds, had made the decorations worthy of what was at once a public rejoicing and a solemn mystery. Higher up on the altar, a flower had opened here and there with a careless grace, holding so unconcernedly, like a final, almost vaporous bedizening, its bunch of stamens, slender as gossamer, which clouded the flower itself in a white mist, that in following these with my eyes, in trying to imitate, somewhere inside myself, the action of their blossoming, I imagined it as a swift and thoughtless movement of the head with an enticing glance from her contracted pupils, by a young girl in white, careless and alive  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0M. Vinteuil had come in with his daughter and had sat down beside us. He belonged to a good family, and had once been music-master to my grandmother\\\\'s sisters; so that when, after losing his wife and inheriting some property, he had retired to the neighbourhood of Combray, we used often to invite him to our house. But with his intense prudishness he had given up coming, so as not to be obliged to meet Swann, who had made what he called \\\"a most unsuitable marriage, as seems to be the fashion in these days.\\\" My mother, on hearing that he \\\\'composed,\\\\' told him by way of a compliment that, when she came to see him, he must play her something of his own. M. Vinteuil would have liked nothing better, but he carried politeness and consideration for others to so fine a point, always putting himself in their place, that he was afraid of boring them, or of appearing egotistical, if he carried out, or even allowed them to suspect what were his own desires. On the day when my parents had gone to pay him a visit, I had accompanied them, but they had allowed me to remain outside, and as M. Vinteuil\\\\'s house, Montjouvain, stood on a site actually hollowed out from a steep hill covered with shrubs, among which I took cover, I had found myself on a level with his drawing-room, upstairs, and only a few feet away from its window. When a servant came in to tell him that my parents had arrived, I had seen M. Vinteuil run to the piano and lay out a sheet of music so as to catch the eye. But as soon as they entered the room he had snatched it away and hidden it in a corner. He was afraid, no doubt, of letting them suppose that he was glad to see them only because it gave him a chance of playing them some of his compositions. And every time that my mother, in the course of her visit, had returned to the subject of his playing, he had hurriedly protested: \\\"I cannot think who put that on the piano; it is not the proper place for it at all,\\\" and had turned the conversation aside to other topics, simply because those were of less interest to himself  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0His one and only passion was for his daughter, and she, with her somewhat boyish appearance, looked so robust that it was hard to restrain a smile when one saw the precautions her father used to take for her health, with spare shawls always in readiness to wrap around her shoulders. My grandmother had drawn our attention to the gentle, delicate, almost timid expression which might often be caught flitting across the face, dusted all over with freckles, of this otherwise stolid child. When she had spoken, she would at once take her own words in the sense in which her audience must have heard them, she would be alarmed at the possibility of a misunderstanding, and one would see, in clear outline, as though in a transparency, beneath the mannish face of the \\\\'good sort\\\\' that she was, the finer features of a young woman in tears  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0When, before turning to leave the church, I made a genuflection before the altar, I felt suddenly, as I rose again, a bitter-sweet fragrance of almonds steal towards me from the hawthorn-blossom, and I then noticed that on the flowers themselves were little spots of a creamier colour, in which I imagined that this fragrance must lie concealed, as the taste of an almond cake lay in the burned parts, or the sweetness of Mile. Vinteuil\\\\'s cheeks beneath their freckles. Despite the heavy, motionless silence of the hawthorns, these gusts of fragrance came to me like the murmuring of an intense vitality, with which the whole altar was quivering like a roadside hedge explored by living antennae, of which I was reminded by seeing some stamens, almost red in colour, which seemed to have kept the springtime virulence, the irritant power of stinging insects now transmuted into flowers  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Outside the church we would stand talking for a moment with M. Vinteuil, in the porch. Boys would be chevying one another in the Square, and he would interfere, taking the side of the little ones and lecturing the big. If his daughter said, in her thick, comfortable voice, how glad she had been to see us, immediately it would seem as though some elder and more sensitive sister, latent in her, had blushed at this thoughtless, schoolboyish utterance, which had, perhaps, made us think that she was angling for an invitation to the house. Her father would then arrange a cloak over her shoulders, they would clamber into a little dog-cart which she herself drove, and home they would both go to Montjouvain. As for ourselves, the next day being Sunday, with no need to be up and stirring before high mass, if it was a moonlight night and warm, then, instead of taking us home at once, my father, in his thirst for personal distinction, would lead us on a long walk round by the Calvary, which my mother\\\\'s utter incapacity for taking her bearings, or even for knowing which road she might be on, made her regard as a triumph of his strategic genius. Sometimes we would go as far as the viaduct, which began to stride on its long legs of stone at the railway station, and to me typified all the wretchedness of exile beyond the last outposts of civilisation, because every year, as we came down from Paris, we would be warned to take special care, when we got to Combray, not to miss the station, to be ready before the train stopped, since it would start again in two minutes and proceed across the viaduct, out of the lands of Christendom, of which Combray, to me, represented the farthest limit. We would return by the Boulevard de la Gare, which contained the most attractive villas in the town. In each of their gardens the moonlight, copying the art of Hubert Robert, had scattered its broken staircases of white marble, its fountains of water and gates temptingly ajar. Its beams had swept away the telegraph office. All that was left of it was a column, half shattered, but preserving the beauty of a ruin which endures for all time. I would by now be dragging my weary limbs, and ready to drop with sleep; the balmy scent of the lime-trees seemed a consolation which I could obtain only at the price of great suffering and exhaustion, and not worthy of the effort. From gates far apart the watchdogs, awakened by our steps in the silence, would set up an antiphonal barking, as I still hear them bark, at times, in the evenings, and it is in their custody when the public gardens of Combray were constructed on its site that the Boulevard de la Gare must have taken refuge, for wherever I may be, as soon as they begin their alternate challenge and acceptance, I can see it again with all its lime-trees, and its pavement glistening beneath the moon  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Suddenly my father would bring us to a standstill and ask my mother\\u2014\\\"Where are we?\\\" Utterly worn out by the walk but still proud of her husband, she would lovingly confess that she had not the least idea. He would shrug his shoulders and laugh. And then, as though it had slipped, with his latchkey, from his waistcoat pocket, he would point out to us, when it stood before our eyes, the back-gate of our own garden, which had come hand-in-hand with the familiar corner of the Rue du Saint-Esprit, to await us, to greet us at the end of our wanderings over paths unknown. My mother would murmur admiringly \\\"You really are wonderful!\\\" And from that instant I had not to take another step; the ground moved forward under my feet in that garden where, for so long, my actions had ceased to require any control, or even attention, from my will. Custom came to take me in her arms, carried me all the way up to my bed, and laid me down there like a little child  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Although Saturday, by beginning an hour earlier, and by depriving her of the services of Fran\\u00e7oise, passed more slowly than other days for my aunt, yet, the moment it was past, and a new week begun, she would look forward with impatience to its return, as something that embodied all the novelty and distraction which her frail and disordered body was still able to endure. This was not to say, however, that she did not long, at times, for some even greater variation, that she did not pass through those abnormal hours in which one thirsts for something different from what one has, when those people who, through lack of energy or imagination, are unable to generate any motive power in themselves, cry out, as the clock strikes or the postman knocks, in their eagerness for news even if it be bad news, for some emotion even that of grief; when the heartstrings, which prosperity has silenced, like a harp laid by, yearn to be plucked and sounded again by some hand, even a brutal hand, even if it shall break them; when the will, which has with such difficulty brought itself to subdue its impulse, to renounce its right to abandon itself to its own uncontrolled desires, and consequent sufferings, would fain cast its guiding reins into the hands of circumstances, coercive and, it may be, cruel. Of course, since my aunt\\\\'s strength, which was completely drained by the slightest exertion, returned but drop by drop into the pool of her repose, the reservoir was very slow in filling, and months would go by before she reached that surplus which other people use up in their daily activities, but which she had no idea\\u2014and could never decide how to employ. And I have no doubt that then\\u2014just as a desire to have her potatoes served with b\\u00e9chamel sauce, for a change, would be formed, ultimately, from the pleasure she found in the daily reappearance of those mashed potatoes of which she was never \\\\'tired\\\\'\\u2014she would extract from the accumulation of those monotonous days on which she so much depended a keen expectation of some domestic cataclysm, instantaneous in its happening, but violent enough to compel her to put into effect, once for all, one of those changes which she knew would be beneficial to her health, but to which she could never make up her mind without some such stimulus. She was genuinely fond of us; she would have enjoyed the long luxury of weeping for our untimely decease; coming at a moment when she felt \\\\'well\\\\' and was not in a perspiration, the news that the house was being destroyed by a fire, in which all the rest of us had already perished, a fire which, in a little while, would not leave one stone standing upon another, but from which she herself would still have plenty of time to escape without undue haste, provided that she rose at once from her bed, must often have haunted her dreams, as a prospect which combined with the two minor advantages of letting her taste the full savour of her affection for us in long years of mourning, and of causing universal stupefaction in the village when she should sally forth to conduct our obsequies, crushed but courageous, moribund but erect, the paramount and priceless boon of forcing her at the right moment, with no time to be lost, no room for weakening hesitations, to go off and spend the summer at her charming farm of Mirougrain, where there was a waterfall. Inasmuch as nothing of this sort had ever occurred, though indeed she must often have pondered the success of such a manoeuvre as she lay alone absorbed in her interminable games of patience and though it must have plunged her in despair from the first moment of its realisation, from the first of those little unforeseen facts, the first word of calamitous news, whose accents can never afterwards be expunged from the memory, everything that bears upon it the imprint of actual, physical death, so terribly different from the logical abstraction of its possibility she would fall back from time to time, to add an interest to her life, upon imagining other, minor catastrophes, which she would follow up with passion. She would beguile herself with a sudden suspicion that Fran\\u00e7oise had been robbing her, that she had set a trap to make certain, and had caught her betrayer red-handed; and being in the habit, when she made up a game of cards by herself, of playing her own and her adversary\\\\'s hands at once, she would first stammer out Fran\\u00e7oise\\\\'s awkward apologies, and then reply to them with such a fiery indignation that any of us who happened to intrude upon her at one of these moments would find her bathed in perspiration, her eyes blazing, her false hair pushed awry and exposing the baldness of her brows. Fran\\u00e7oise must often, from the next room, have heard these mordant sarcasms levelled at herself, the mere framing of which in words would not have relieved my aunt\\\\'s feelings sufficiently, had they been allowed to remain in a purely immaterial form, without the degree of substance and reality which she added to them by murmuring them half-aloud. Sometimes, however, even these counterpane dramas would not satisfy my aunt; she must see her work staged. And so, on a Sunday, with all the doors mysteriously closed, she would confide in Eulalie her doubts of Fran\\u00e7oise\\\\'s integrity and her determination to be rid of her, and on another day she would confide in Fran\\u00e7oise her suspicions of the disloyalty of Eulalie, to whom the front-door would very soon be closed for good. A few days more, and, disgusted with her latest confidant, she would again be \\\\'as thick as thieves\\\\' with the traitor, while, before the next performance, the two would once more have changed their parts. But the suspicions which Eulalie might occasionally breed in her were no more than a fire of straw, which must soon subside for lack of fuel, since Eulalie was not living with her in the house. It was a very different matter when the suspect was Fran\\u00e7oise, of whose presence under the same roof as herself my aunt was perpetually conscious, while for fear of catching cold, were she to leave her bed, she would never dare go downstairs to the kitchen to see for herself whether there was, indeed, any foundation for her suspicions. And so on by degrees, until her mind had no other occupation than to attempt, at every hour of the day, to discover what was being done, what was being concealed from her by Fran\\u00e7oise. She would detect the most furtive movement of Fran\\u00e7oise\\\\'s features, something contradictory in what she was saying, some desire which she appeared to be screening. And she would shew her that she was unmasked, by, a single word, which made Fran\\u00e7oise turn pale, and which my aunt seemed to find a cruel satisfaction in driving into her unhappy servant\\\\'s heart. And the very next Sunday a disclosure by Eulalie\\u2014like one of those discoveries which suddenly open up an unsuspected field for exploration to some new science which has hitherto followed only the beaten paths\\u2014proved to my aunt that her own worst suspicions fell a long way short of the appalling truth. \\\"But Fran\\u00e7oise ought to know that,\\\" said Eulalie, \\\"now that you have given her a carriage.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Now that I have given her a carriage!\\\" gasped my aunt  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Oh, but I didn\\\\'t know; I only thought so; I saw her go by yesterday in her open coach, as proud as Artaban, on her way to Roussainville market. I supposed that it must be Mme. Octave who had given it to her.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0So on by degrees, until Fran\\u00e7oise and my aunt, the quarry and the hunter, could never cease from trying to forestall each other\\\\'s devices. My mother was afraid lest Fran\\u00e7oise should develop a genuine hatred of my aunt, who was doing everything in her power to annoy her. However that might be, Fran\\u00e7oise had come, more and more, to pay an infinitely scrupulous attention to my aunt\\\\'s least word and gesture. When she had to ask her for anything she would hesitate, first, for a long time, making up her mind how best to begin. And when she had uttered her request, she would watch my aunt covertly, trying to guess from the expression on her face what she thought of it, and how she would reply. And in this way\\u2014whereas an artist who had been reading memoirs of the seventeenth century, and wished to bring himself nearer to the great Louis, would consider that he was making progress in that direction when he constructed a pedigree that traced his own descent from some historic family, or when he engaged in correspondence with one of the reigning Sovereigns of Europe, and so would shut his eyes to the mistake he was making in seeking to establish a similarity by an exact and therefore lifeless copy of mere outward forms\\u2014a middle-aged lady in a small country town, by doing no more than yield whole-hearted obedience to her own irresistible eccentricities, and to a spirit of mischief engendered by the utter idleness of her existence, could see, without ever having given a thought to Louis XIV, the most trivial occupations of her daily life, her morning toilet, her luncheon, her afternoon nap, assume, by virtue of their despotic singularity, something of the interest that was to be found in what Saint-Simon used to call the \\\\'machinery\\\\' of life at Versailles; and was able, too, to persuade herself that her silence, a shade of good humour or of arrogance on her features, would provide Fran\\u00e7oise with matter for a mental commentary as tense with passion and terror, as did the silence, the good humour or the arrogance of the King when a courtier, or even his greatest nobles, had presented a petition to him, at the turning of an avenue, at Versailles  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0One Sunday, when my aunt had received simultaneous visits from the Cur\\u00e9 and from Eulalie, and had been left alone, afterwards, to rest, the whole family went upstairs to bid her good night, and Mamma ventured to condole with her on the unlucky coincidence that always brought both visitors to her door at the same time  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"I hear that things went wrong again to-day, L\\u00e9onie,\\\" she said kindly, \\\"you have had all your friends here at once.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And my great-aunt interrupted with: \\\"Too many good things...\\\" for, since her daughter\\\\'s illness, she felt herself in duty bound to revive her as far as possible by always drawing her attention to the brighter side of things. But my father had begun to speak  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"I should like to take advantage,\\\" he said, \\\"of the whole family\\\\'s being here together, to tell you a story, so as not to have to begin all over again to each of you separately. I am afraid we are in M. Legrandin\\\\'s bad books; he would hardly say \\\\'How d\\\\'ye do\\\\' to me this morning.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0I did not wait to hear the end of my father\\\\'s story, for I had been with him myself after mass when we had passed M. Legrandin; instead, I went downstairs to the kitchen to ask for the bill of fare for our dinner, which was of fresh interest to me daily, like the news in a paper, and excited me as might the programme of a coming festivity  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0As M. Legrandin had passed close by us on our way from church, walking by the side of a lady, the owner of a country house in the neighbourhood, whom we knew only by sight, my father had saluted him in a manner at once friendly and reserved, without stopping in his walk; M. Legrandin had barely acknowledged the courtesy, and then with an air of surprise, as though he had not recognised us, and with that distant look characteristic of people who do not wish to be agreeable, and who from the suddenly receding depths of their eyes seem to have caught sight of you at the far end of an interminably straight road, and at so great a distance that they content themselves with directing towards you an almost imperceptible movement of the head, in proportion to your doll-like dimensions  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Now, the lady who was walking with Legrandin was a model of virtue, known and highly respected; there could be no question of his being out for amorous adventure, and annoyed at being detected; and my father asked himself how he could possibly have displeased our friend  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"I should be all the more sorry to feel that he was angry with us,\\\" he said, \\\"because among all those people in their Sunday clothes there is something about him, with his little cut-away coat and his soft neckties, so little \\\\'dressed-up,\\\\' so genuinely simple; an air of innocence, almost, which is really attractive.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0But the vote of the family council was unanimous, that my father had imagined the whole thing, or that Legrandin, at the moment in question, had been preoccupied in thinking about something else. Anyhow, my father\\\\'s fears were dissipated no later than the following evening. As we returned from a long walk we saw, near the Pont-Vieux, Legrandin himself, who, on account of the holidays, was spending a few days more in Combray. He came up to us with outstretched hand: \\\"Do you know, master book-lover,\\\" he asked me, \\\"this line of Paul Desjardins?  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0  Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Is not that a fine rendering of a moment like this? Perhaps you have never read Paul Desjardins. Read him, my boy, read him; in these days he is converted, they tell me, into a preaching friar, but he used to have the most charming water-colour touch\\u2014  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0  Now are the woods all black, but still the sky is blue  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0May you always see a blue sky overhead, my young friend; and then, even when the time comes, which is coming now for me, when the woods are all black, when night is fast falling, you will be able to console yourself, as I am doing, by looking up to the sky.\\\" He took a cigarette from his pocket and stood for a long time, his eyes fixed on the horizon. \\\"Goodbye, friends!\\\" he suddenly exclaimed, and left us.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0At the hour when I usually went downstairs to find out what there was for dinner, its preparation would already have begun, and Fran\\u00e7oise, a colonel with all the forces of nature for her subalterns, as in the fairy-tales where giants hire themselves out as scullions, would be stirring the coals, putting the potatoes to steam, and, at the right moment, finishing over the fire those culinary masterpieces which had been first got ready in some of the great array of vessels, triumphs of the potter\\\\'s craft, which ranged from tubs and boilers and cauldrons and fish kettles down to jars for game, moulds for pastry, and tiny pannikins for cream, and included an entire collection of pots and pans of every shape and size. I would stop by the table, where the kitchen-maid had shelled them, to inspect the platoons of peas, drawn up in ranks and numbered, like little green marbles, ready for a game; but what fascinated me would be the asparagus, tinged with ultramarine and rosy pink which ran from their heads, finely stippled in mauve and azure, through a series of imperceptible changes to their white feet, still stained a little by the soil of their garden-bed: a rainbow-loveliness that was not of this world. I felt that these celestial hues indicated the presence of exquisite creatures who had been pleased to assume vegetable form, who, through the disguise which covered their firm and edible flesh, allowed me to discern in this radiance of earliest dawn, these hinted rainbows, these blue evening shades, that precious quality which I should recognise again when, all night long after a dinner at which I had partaken of them, they played lyrical and coarse in their jesting as the fairies in Shakespeare\\\\'s Dream at transforming my humble chamber into a bower of aromatic perfume.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Poor Giotto\\\\'s Charity, as Swann had named her, charged by Fran\\u00e7oise with the task of preparing them for the table, would have them lying beside her in a basket; sitting with a mournful air, as though all the sorrows of the world were heaped upon her; and the light crowns of azure which capped the asparagus shoots above their pink jackets would be finely and separately outlined, star by star, as in Giotto\\\\'s fresco are the flowers banded about the brows, or patterning the basket of his Virtue at Padua. And, meanwhile, Fran\\u00e7oise would be turning on the spit one of those chickens, such as she alone knew how to roast, chickens which had wafted far abroad from Combray the sweet savour of her merits, and which, while she was serving them to us at table, would make the quality of kindness predominate for the moment in my private conception of her character; the aroma of that cooked flesh, which she knew how to make so unctuous and so tender, seeming to me no more than the proper perfume of one of her many virtues.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0But the day on which, while my father took counsel with his family upon our strange meeting with Legrandin, I went down to the kitchen, was one of those days when Giotto\\\\'s Charity, still very weak and ill after her recent confinement, had been unable to rise from her bed; Fran\\u00e7oise, being without assistance, had fallen into arrears. When I went in, I saw her in the back-kitchen which opened on to the courtyard, in process of killing a chicken; by its desperate and quite natural resistance, which Fran\\u00e7oise, beside herself with rage as she attempted to slit its throat beneath the ear, accompanied with shrill cries of \\\"Filthy creature! Filthy creature!\\\" it made the saintly kindness and unction of our servant rather less prominent than it would do, next day at dinner, when it made its appearance in a skin gold-embroidered like a chasuble, and its precious juice was poured out drop by drop as from a pyx. When it was dead Fran\\u00e7oise mopped up its streaming blood, in which, however, she did not let her rancour drown, for she gave vent to another burst of rage, and, gazing down at the carcass of her enemy, uttered a final \\\"Filthy creature!\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0I crept out of the kitchen and upstairs, trembling all over; I could have prayed, then, for the instant dismissal of Fran\\u00e7oise. But who would have baked me such hot rolls, boiled me such fragrant coffee, and even\\u2014roasted me such chickens? And, as it happened, everyone else had already had to make the same cowardly reckoning. For my aunt L\\u00e9onie knew though I was still in ignorance of this that Fran\\u00e7oise, who, for her own daughter or for her nephews, would have given her life without a murmur, shewed a singular implacability in her dealings with the rest of the world. In spite of which my aunt still retained her, for, while conscious of her cruelty, she could appreciate her services. I began gradually to realise that Fran\\u00e7oise\\\\'s kindness, her compunction, the sum total of her virtues concealed many of these back-kitchen tragedies, just as history reveals to us that the reigns of the kings and queens who are portrayed as kneeling with clasped hands in the windows of churches, were stained by oppression and bloodshed. I had taken note of the fact that, apart from her own kinsfolk, the sufferings of humanity inspired in her a pity which increased in direct ratio to the distance separating the sufferers from herself. The tears which flowed from her in torrents when she read of the misfortunes of persons unknown to her, in a newspaper, were quickly stemmed once she had been able to form a more accurate mental picture of the victims. One night, shortly after her confinement, the kitchen-maid was seized with the most appalling pains; Mamma heard her groans, and rose and awakened Fran\\u00e7oise, who, quite unmoved, declared that all the outcry was mere malingering, that the girl wanted to \\\\'play the mistress\\\\' in the house. The doctor, who had been afraid of some such attack, had left a marker in a medical dictionary which we had, at the page on which the symptoms were described, and had told us to turn up this passage, where we would find the measures of \\\\'first aid\\\\' to be adopted. My mother sent Fran\\u00e7oise to fetch the book, warning her not to let the marker drop out. An hour elapsed, and Fran\\u00e7oise had not returned; my mother, supposing that she had gone back to bed, grew vexed, and told me to go myself to the bookcase and fetch the volume. I did so, and there found Fran\\u00e7oise who, in her curiosity to know what the marker indicated, had begun to read the clinical account of these after-pains, and was violently sobbing, now that it was a question of a type of illness with which she was not familiar. At each painful symptom mentioned by the writer she would exclaim: \\\"Oh, oh, Holy Virgin, is it possible that God wishes any wretched human creature to suffer so? Oh, the poor girl!\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0But when I had called her, and she had returned to the bedside of Giotto\\\\'s Charity, her tears at once ceased to flow; she could find no stimulus for that pleasant sensation of tenderness and pity which she very well knew, having been moved to it often enough by the perusal of newspapers; nor any other pleasure of the same kind in her sense of weariness and irritation at being pulled out of bed in the middle of the night for the kitchen-maid; so that at the sight of those very sufferings, the printed account of which had moved her to tears, she had nothing to offer but ill-tempered mutterings, mingled with bitter sarcasm, saying, when she thought that we had gone out of earshot: \\\"Well, she need never have done what she must have done to bring all this about! She found that pleasant enough, I dare say! She had better not put on any airs now. All the same, he must have been a god-forsaken young man to go after that. Dear, dear, it\\\\'s just as they used to say in my poor mother\\\\'s country:  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0  Snaps and snails and puppy-dogs\\\\' tails \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0  And dirty sluts in plenty \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0  Smell sweeter than roses in young men\\\\'s noses \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0 When the heart is one-and-twenty.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Although, when her grandson had a slight cold in his head, she would Bet off at night, even if she were ill also, instead of going to bed, to see whether he had everything that he wanted, covering ten miles on foot before daybreak so as to be in time to begin her work, this same love for her own people, and her desire to establish the future greatness of her house on a solid foundation reacted, in her policy with regard to the other servants, in one unvarying maxim, which was never to let any of them set foot in my aunt\\\\'s room; indeed she shewed a sort of pride in not allowing anyone else to come near my aunt, preferring, when she herself was ill, to get out of bed and to administer the Vichy water in person, rather than to concede to the kitchen-maid the right of entry into her mistress\\\\'s presence. There is a species of hymenoptera, observed by Fabre, the burrowing wasp, which in order to provide a supply of fresh meat for her offspring after her own decease, calls in the science of anatomy to amplify the resources of her instinctive cruelty, and, having made a collection of weevils and spiders, proceeds with marvellous knowledge and skill to pierce the nerve-centre on which their power of locomotion but none of their other vital functions depends, so that the paralysed insect, beside which her egg is laid, will furnish the larva, when it is hatched, with a tamed and inoffensive quarry, incapable either of flight or of resistance, but perfectly fresh for the larder: in the same way Fran\\u00e7oise had adopted, to minister to her permanent and unfaltering resolution to render the house uninhabitable to any other servant, a series of crafty and pitiless stratagems. Many years later we discovered that, if we had been fed on asparagus day after day throughout that whole season, it was because the smell of the plants gave the poor kitchen-maid, who had to prepare them, such violent attacks of asthma that she was finally obliged to leave my aunt\\\\'s service.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Alas! we had definitely to alter our opinion of M. Legrandin. On one-of the Sundays following our meeting with him on the Pont-Vieux, after which my father had been forced to confess himself mistaken, as mass drew to an end, and, with the sunshine and the noise of the outer world, something else invaded the church, an atmosphere so far from sacred that Mme. Goupil, Mme. Percepied all those, in fact, who a moment ago, when I arrived a little late, had been sitting motionless, their eyes fixed on their prayer-books; who, I might even have thought, had not seen me come in, had not their feet moved slightly to push away the little kneeling-desk which was preventing me from getting to my chair began in loud voices to discuss with us all manner of utterly mundane topics, as though we were already outside in the Square, we saw, standing on the sun-baked steps of the porch, dominating the many-coloured tumult of the market, Legrandin himself, whom the husband of the lady we had seen with him, on the previous occasion, was just going to introduce to the wife of another large landed proprietor of the district. Legrandin\\\\'s face shewed an extraordinary zeal and animation; he made a profound bow, with a subsidiary backward movement which brought his spine sharply up into a position behind its starting-point, a gesture in which he must have been trained by the husband of his sister, Mme. de Cambremer. This rapid recovery caused a sort of tense muscular wave to ripple over Legrandin\\\\'s hips, which I had not supposed to be so fleshy; I cannot say why, but this undulation of pure matter, this wholly carnal fluency, with not the least hint in it of spiritual significance, this wave lashed to a fury by the wind of an assiduity, an obsequiousness of the basest sort, awoke my mind suddenly to the possibility of a Legrandin altogether different from the one whom we knew. The lady gave him some message for her coachman, and while he was stepping down to her carriage the impression of joy, timid and devout, which the introduction had stamped there, still lingered on his face. Carried away in a sort of dream, he smiled, then he began to hurry back towards the lady; he was walking faster than usual, and his shoulders swayed backwards and forwards, right and left, in the most absurd fashion; altogether he looked, so utterly had he abandoned himself to it, ignoring all other considerations, as though he were the lifeless and wire-pulled puppet of his own happiness. Meanwhile we were coming out through the porch; we were passing close beside him; he was too well bred to turn his head away; but he fixed his eyes, which had suddenly changed to those of a seer, lost in the profundity of his vision, on so distant a point of the horizon that he could not see us, and so had not to acknowledge our presence. His face emerged, still with an air of innocence, from his straight and pliant coat, which looked as though conscious of having been led astray, in spite of itself, and plunged into surroundings of a detested splendour. And a spotted necktie, stirred by the breezes of the Square, continued to float in front of Legrandin, like the standard of his proud isolation, of his noble independence. Just as we reached the house my mother discovered that we had forgotten the \\\\'Saint-Honor\\u00e9,\\\\' and asked my father to go back with me and tell them to send it up at once. Near the church we met Legrandin, coming towards us with the same lady, whom he was escorting to her carriage. He brushed past us, and did not interrupt what he was saying to her, but gave us, out of the corner of his blue eye, a little sign, which began and ended, so to speak, inside his eyelids, and as it did not involve the least movement of his facial muscles, managed to pass quite unperceived by the lady; but, striving to compensate by the intensity of his feelings for the somewhat restricted field in which they had to find expression, he made that blue chink, which was set apart for us, sparkle with all the animation of cordiality, which went far beyond mere playfulness, and almost touched the border-line of roguery; he subtilised the refinements of good-fellowship into a wink of connivance, a hint, a hidden meaning, a secret understanding, all the mysteries of complicity in a plot, and finally exalted his assurances of friendship to the level of protestations of affection, even of a declaration of love, lighting up for us, and for us alone, with a secret and languid flame invisible by the great lady upon his other side, an enamoured pupil in a countenance of ice.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Only the day before he had asked my parents to send me to dine with him on this same Sunday evening. \\\"Come and bear your aged friend company,\\\" he had said to me. \\\"Like the nosegay which a traveller sends us from some land to which we shall never go again, come and let me breathe from the far country of your adolescence the scent of those flowers of spring among which I also used to wander, many years ago. Come with the primrose, with the canon\\\\'s beard, with the gold-cup; come with the stone-crop, whereof are posies made, pledges of love, in the Balzacian flora, come with that flower of the Resurrection morning, the Easter daisy, come with the snowballs of the guelder-rose, which begin to embalm with their fragrance the alleys of your great-aunt\\\\'s garden ere the last snows of Lent are melted from its soil. Come with the glorious silken raiment of the lily, apparel fit for Solomon, and with the many-coloured enamel of the pansies, but come, above all, with the spring breeze, still cooled by the last frosts of winter, wafting apart, for the two butterflies\\\\' sake, that have waited outside all morning, the closed portals of the first Jerusalem rose.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The question was raised at home whether, all things considered, I ought still to be sent to dine with M. Legrandin. But my grandmother refused to believe that he could have been impolite.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"You admit yourself that he appears at church there, quite simply dressed, and all that; he hardly looks like a man of fashion.\\\" She added that; in any event, even if, at the worst, he had been intentionally rude, it was far better for us to pretend that we had noticed nothing. And indeed my father himself, though more annoyed than any of us by the attitude which Legrandin had adopted, may still have held in reserve a final uncertainty as to its true meaning. It was like every attitude or action which reveals a man\\\\'s deep and hidden character; they bear no relation to what he has previously said, and we cannot confirm our suspicions by the culprit\\\\'s evidence, for he will admit nothing; we are reduced to the evidence of our own senses, and we ask ourselves, in the face of this detached and incoherent fragment of recollection, whether indeed our senses have not been the victims of a hallucination; with the result that such attitudes, and these alone are of importance in indicating character, are the most apt to leave us in perplexity.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0I dined with Legrandin on the terrace of his house, by moonlight. \\\"There is a charming quality, is there not,\\\" he said to me, \\\"in this silence; for hearts that are wounded, as mine is, a novelist, whom you will read in time to come, claims that there is no remedy but silence and shadow. And see you this, my boy, there comes in all lives a time, towards which you still have far to go, when the weary eyes can endure but one kind of light, the light which a fine evening like this prepares for us in the stillroom of darkness, when the ears can listen to no music save what the moonlight breathes through the flute of silence.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0I could hear what M. Legrandin was saying; like everything that he said, it sounded attractive; but I was disturbed by the memory of a lady whom I had seen recently for the first time; and thinking, now that I knew that Legrandin was on friendly terms with several of the local aristocracy, that perhaps she also was among his acquaintance, I summoned up all my courage and said to him: \\\"Tell me, sir, do you, by any chance, know the lady\\u2014the ladies of Guermantes?\\\" and I felt glad because, in pronouncing the name, I had secured a sort of power over it, by the mere act of drawing it up out of my dreams and giving it an objective existence in the world of spoken things  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0But, at the sound of the word Guermantes, I saw in the middle of each of our friend\\\\'s blue eyes a little brown dimple appear, as though they had been stabbed by some invisible pin-point, while the rest of his pupils, reacting from the shock, received and secreted the azure overflow. His fringed eyelids darkened, and drooped. His mouth, which had been stiffened and seared with bitter lines, was the first to recover, and smiled, while his eyes still seemed full of pain, like the eyes of a good-looking martyr whose body bristles with arrows  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"No, I do not know them,\\\" he said, but instead of uttering so simple a piece of information, a reply in which there was so little that could astonish me, in the natural and conversational tone which would have befitted it, he recited it with a separate stress upon each word, leaning forward, bowing his head, with at once the vehemence which a man gives, so as to be believed, to a highly improbable statement as though the fact that he did not know the Guermantes could be due only to some strange accident of fortune and with the emphasis of a man who, finding himself unable to keep silence about what is to him a painful situation, chooses to proclaim it aloud, so as to convince his hearers that the confession he is making is one that causes him no embarrassment, but is easy, agreeable, spontaneous, that the situation in question, in this case the absence of relations with the Guermantes family, might very well have been not forced upon, but actually designed by Legrandin himself, might arise from some family tradition, some moral principle or mystical vow which expressly forbade his seeking their society  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"No,\\\" he resumed, explaining by his words the tone in which they were uttered. \\\"No, I do not know them; I have never wished to know them; I have always made a point of preserving complete independence; at heart, as you know, I am a bit of a Radical. People are always coming to me about it, telling me I am mistaken in not going to Guermantes, that I make myself seem ill-bred, uncivilised, an old bear. But that\\\\'s not the sort of reputation that can frighten me; it\\\\'s too true! In my heart of hearts I care for nothing in the world now but a few churches, books\\u2014two or three, pictures\\u2014rather more, perhaps, and the light of the moon when the fresh breeze of youth such as yours wafts to my nostrils the scent of gardens whose flowers my old eyes are not sharp enough, now, to distinguish.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0I did not understand very clearly why, in order to refrain from going to the houses of people whom one did not know, it should be necessary to cling to one\\\\'s independence, nor how that could give one the appearance of a savage or a bear. But what I did understand was this, that Legrandin was not altogether truthful when he said that he cared only for churches, moonlight, and youth; he cared also, he cared a very great deal, for people who lived in country houses, and would be so much afraid, when in their company, of incurring their displeasure that he would never dare to let them see that he numbered, as well, among his friends middle-class people, the families of solicitors and stockbrokers, preferring, if the truth must be known, that it should be revealed in his absence, when he was out of earshot, that judgment should go against him if so it must by default: in a word, he was a snob. Of course he would never have admitted all or any of this in the poetical language which my family and I so much admired. And if I asked him, \\\"Do you know the Guermantes family?\\\" Legrandin the talker would reply, \\\"No, I have never cared to know them.\\\" But unfortunately the talker was now subordinated to another Legrandin, whom he kept carefully hidden in his breast, whom he would never consciously exhibit, because this other could tell stories about our own Legrandin and about his snobbishness which would have ruined his reputation for ever; and this other Legrandin had replied to me already in that wounded look, that stiffened smile, the undue gravity of his tone in uttering those few words, in the thousand arrows by which our own Legrandin had instantaneously been stabbed and sickened, like a Saint Sebastian of snobbery:  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Oh, how you hurt me! No, I do not know the Guermantes family. Do not remind me of the great sorrow of my life.\\\" And since this other, this irrepressible, dominant, despotic Legrandin, if he lacked our Legrandin\\\\'s charming vocabulary, shewed an infinitely greater promptness in expressing himself, by means of what are called \\\\'reflexes,\\\\' it followed that, when Legrandin the talker attempted to silence him, he would already have spoken, and it would be useless for our friend to deplore the bad impression which the revelations of his alter ego must have caused, since he could do no more now than endeavour to mitigate them  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0This was not to say that M. Legrandin was anything but sincere when he inveighed against snobs. He could not from his own knowledge, at least be aware that he was one also, since it is only with the passions of others that we are ever really familiar, and what we come to find out about our own can be no more than what other people have shewn us. Upon ourselves they react but indirectly, through our imagination, which substitutes for our actual, primary motives other, secondary motives, less stark and therefore more decent. Never had Legrandin\\\\'s snobbishness impelled him to make a habit of visiting a duchess as such. Instead, it would set his imagination to make that duchess appear, in Legrandin\\\\'s eyes, endowed with all the graces. He would be drawn towards the duchess, assuring himself the while that he was yielding to the attractions of her mind, and her other virtues, which the vile race of snobs could never understand. Only his fellow-snobs knew that he was of their number, for, owing to their inability to appreciate the intervening efforts of his imagination, they saw in close juxtaposition the social activities of Legrandin and their primary cause  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0At home, meanwhile, we had no longer any illusions as to M. Legrandin, and our relations with him had become much more distant. Mamma would be greatly delighted whenever she caught him red-handed in the sin, which he continued to call the unpardonable sin, of snobbery. As for my father, he found it difficult to take Legrandin\\\\'s airs in so light, in so detached a spirit; and when there was some talk, one year, of sending me to spend the long summer holidays at Balbec with my grandmother, he said: \\\"I must, most certainly, tell Legrandin that you are going to Balbec, to see whether he will offer you an introduction to his sister. He probably doesn\\\\'t remember telling us that she lived within a mile of the place.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0My grandmother, who held that, when one went to the seaside, one ought to be on the beach from morning to night, to taste the salt breezes, and that one should not know anyone in the place, because calls and parties and excursions were so much time stolen from what belonged, by rights, to the sea-air, begged him on no account to speak to Legrandin of our plans; for already, in her mind\\\\'s eye, she could see his sister, Mme. de Cambremer, alighting from her carriage at the door of our hotel just as we were on the point of going out fishing, and obliging us to remain indoors all afternoon to entertain her. But Mamma laughed her fears to scorn, for she herself felt that the danger was not so threatening, and that Legrandin would shew no undue anxiety to make us acquainted with his sister. And, as it happened, there was no need for any of us to introduce the subject of Balbec, for it was Legrandin himself who, without the least suspicion that we had ever had any intention of visiting those parts, walked into the trap uninvited one evening, when we met him strolling on the banks of the Vivonne  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"There are tints in the clouds this evening, violets and blues, which are very beautiful, are they not, my friend?\\\" he said to my father. \\\"Especially a blue which is far more floral than atmospheric, a cineraria blue, which it is surprising to see in the sky. And that little pink cloud there, has it not just the tint of some flower, a carnation or hydrangea? Nowhere, perhaps, except on the shores of the English Channel, where Normandy merges into Brittany, have I been able to find such copious examples of what you might call a vegetable kingdom in the clouds. Down there, close to Balbec, among all those places which are still so uncivilised, there is a little bay, charmingly quiet, where the sunsets of the Auge Valley, those red-and-gold sunsets which, all the same, I am very far from despising seem commonplace and insignificant; for in that moist and gentle atmosphere these heavenly flower-beds will break into blossom, in a few moments, in the evenings, incomparably lovely, and often lasting for hours before they fade. Others shed their leaves at once, and then it is more beautiful still to see the sky strewn with the scattering of their innumerable petals, sulphurous yellow and rosy red. In that bay, which they call the Opal Bay, the golden sands appear more charming still from being fastened, like fair Andromeda, to those terrible rocks of the surrounding coast, to that funereal shore, famed for the number of its wrecks, where every winter many a brave vessel falls a victim to the perils of the sea. Balbec! the oldest bone in the geological skeleton that underlies our soil, the true Armor, the sea, the land\\\\'s end, the accursed region which Anatole France\\u2014an enchanter whose works our young friend ought to read\\u2014has so well depicted, beneath its eternal fogs, as though it were indeed the land of the Cimmerians in the Odyssey. Balbec; yes, they are building hotels there now, superimposing them upon its ancient and charming soil, which they are powerless to alter; how delightful it is, down there, to be able to step out at once into regions so primitive and so entrancing.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Indeed! And do you know anyone at Balbec?\\\" inquired my father. \\\"This young man is just going to spend a couple of months there with his grandmother, and my wife too, perhaps.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Legrandin, taken unawares by the question at a moment when he was looking directly at my father, was unable to turn aside his gaze, and so concentrated it with steadily increasing intensity\\u2014smiling mournfully the while\\u2014upon the eyes of his questioner, with an air of friendliness and frankness and of not being afraid to look him in the face, until he seemed to have penetrated my father\\\\'s skull, as it had been a ball of glass, and to be seeing, at the moment, a long way beyond and behind it, a brightly coloured cloud, which provided him with a mental alibi, and would enable him to establish the theory that, just when he was being asked whether he knew anyone at Balbec, he had been thinking of something else, and so had not heard the question. As a rule these tactics make the questioner proceed to ask, \\\"Why, what are you thinking about?\\\" But my father, inquisitive, annoyed, and cruel, repeated: \\\"Have you friends, then, in that neighbourhood, that you know Balbec so well?\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0In a final and desperate effort the smiling gaze of Legrandin struggled to the extreme limits of its tenderness, vagueness, candour, and distraction; then feeling, no doubt, that there was nothing left for it now but to answer, he said to us: \\\"I have friends all the world over, wherever there are companies of trees, stricken but not defeated, which have come together to offer a common supplication, with pathetic obstinacy, to an inclement sky which has no mercy upon them.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"That is not quite what I meant,\\\" interrupted my father, obstinate as a tree and merciless as the sky. \\\"I asked you, in case anything should happen to my mother-in-law and she wanted to feel that she was not all alone down there, at the ends of the earth, whether you knew any of the people.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"There as elsewhere, I know everyone and I know no one,\\\" replied Legrandin, who was by no means ready yet to surrender; \\\"places I know well, people very slightly. But, down there, the places themselves seem to me just like people, rare and wonderful people, of a delicate quality which would have been corrupted and ruined by the gift of life. Perhaps it is a castle which you encounter upon the cliff\\\\'s edge; standing there by the roadside, where it has halted to contemplate its sorrows before an evening sky, still rosy, through which a golden moon is climbing; while the fishing-boats, homeward bound, creasing the watered silk of the Channel, hoist its pennant at their mastheads and carry its colours. Or perhaps it is a simple dwelling-house that stands alone, ugly, if anything, timid-seeming but full of romance, hiding from every eye some imperishable secret of happiness and disenchantment. That land which knows not truth,\\\" he continued with Machiavellian subtlety, \\\"that land of infinite fiction makes bad reading for any boy; and is certainly not what I should choose or recommend for my young friend here, who is already so much inclined to melancholy, for a heart already predisposed to receive its impressions. Climates that breathe amorous secrets and futile regrets may agree with an old and disillusioned man like myself; but they must always prove fatal to a temperament which is still unformed. Believe me,\\\" he went on with emphasis, \\\"the waters of that bay\\u2014more Breton than Norman\\u2014may exert a sedative influence, though even that is of questionable value, upon a heart which, like mine, is no longer unbroken, a heart for whose wounds there is no longer anything to compensate. But at your age, my boy, those waters are contra-indicated.... Good night to you, neighbours,\\\" he added, moving away from us with that evasive abruptness to which we were accustomed; and then, turning towards us, with a physicianly finger raised in warning, he resumed the consultation: \\\"No Balbec before you are fifty!\\\" he called out to me, \\\"and even then it must depend on the state of the heart.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0My father spoke to him of it again, as often as we met him, and tortured him with questions, but it was labour in vain: like that scholarly swindler who devoted to the fabrication of forged palimpsests a wealth of skill and knowledge and industry the hundredth part of which would have sufficed to establish him in a more lucrative\\u2014but an honourable occupation, M. Legrandin, had we insisted further, would in the end have constructed a whole system of ethics, and a celestial geography of Lower Normandy, sooner than admit to us that, within a mile of Balbec, his own sister was living in her own house; sooner than find himself obliged to offer us a letter of introduction, the prospect of which would never have inspired him with such terror had he been absolutely certain\\u2014as, from his knowledge of my grandmother\\\\'s character, he really ought to have been certain\\u2014that in no circumstances whatsoever would we have dreamed of making use of it.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0* * *  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0We used always to return from our walks in good time to pay aunt L\\u00e9onie a visit before dinner. In the first weeks of our Combray holidays, when the days ended early, we would still be able to see, as we turned into the Rue du Saint-Esprit, a reflection of the western sky from the windows of the house and a band of purple at the foot of the Calvary, which was mirrored further on in the pond; a fiery glow which, accompanied often by a cold that burned and stung, would associate itself in my mind with the glow of the fire over which, at that very moment, was roasting the chicken that was to furnish me, in place of the poetic pleasure I had found in my walk, with the sensual pleasures of good feeding, warmth and rest. But in summer, when we came back to the house, the sun would not have set; and while we were upstairs paying our visit to aunt L\\u00e9onie its rays, sinking until they touched and lay along her window-sill, would there be caught and held by the large inner curtains and the bands which tied them back to the wall, and split and scattered and filtered; and then, at last, would fall upon and inlay with tiny flakes of gold the lemonwood of her chest-of-drawers, illuminating the room in their passage with the same delicate, slanting, shadowed beams that fall among the boles of forest trees. But on some days, though very rarely, the chest-of-drawers would long since have shed its momentary adornments, there would no longer, as we turned into the Rue du Saint-Esprit, be any reflection from the western sky burning along the line of window-panes; the pond beneath the Calvary would have lost its fiery glow, sometimes indeed had changed already to an opalescent pallor, while a long ribbon of moonlight, bent and broken and broadened by every ripple upon the water\\\\'s surface, would be lying across it, from end to end. Then, as we drew near the house, we would make out a figure standing upon the doorstep, and Mamma would say to me: \\\"Good heavens! There is Fran\\u00e7oise looking out for us; your aunt must be anxious; that means we are late.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And without wasting time by stopping to take off our \\\\'things\\\\' we would fly upstairs to my aunt L\\u00e9onie\\\\'s room to reassure her, to prove to her by our bodily presence that all her gloomy imaginings were false, that, on the contrary, nothing had happened to us, but that we had gone the \\\\'Guermantes way,\\\\' and, good lord, when one took that walk, my aunt knew well enough that one could never say at what time one would be home  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"There, Fran\\u00e7oise,\\\" my aunt would say, \\\"didn\\\\'t I tell you that they must have gone the Guermantes way? Good gracious! They must be hungry! And your nice leg of mutton will be quite dried up now, after all the hours it\\\\'s been waiting. What a time to come in! Well, and so you went the Guermantes way?\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"But, Leonie, I supposed you knew,\\\" Mamma would answer. \\\"I thought that Fran\\u00e7oise had seen us go out by the little gate, through the kitchen-garden.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0For there were, in the environs of Combray, two \\\\'ways\\\\' which we used to take for our walks, and so diametrically opposed that we would actually leave the house by a different door, according to the way we had chosen: the way towards M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise-la-Vineuse, which we called also \\\\'Swann\\\\'s way,\\\\' because, to get there, one had to pass along the boundary of M. Swann\\\\'s estate, and the \\\\'Guermantes way.\\\\' Of M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise-la-Vineuse, to tell the truth, I never knew anything more than the way there, and the strange people who would come over on Sundays to take the air in Combray, people whom, this time, neither my aunt nor any of us would \\\\'know at all,\\\\' and whom we would therefore assume to be \\\\'people who must have come over from M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise.\\\\' As for Guermantes, I was to know it well enough one day, but that day had still to come; and, during the whole of my boyhood, if M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise was to me something as inaccessible as the horizon, which remained hidden from sight, however far one went, by the folds of a country which no longer bore the least resemblance to the country round Combray; Guermantes, on the other hand, meant no more than the ultimate goal, ideal rather than real, of the \\\\'Guermantes way,\\\\' a sort of abstract geographical term like the North Pole or the Equator. And so to \\\\'take the Guermantes way\\\\' in order to get to M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise, or vice versa, would have seemed to me as nonsensical a proceeding as to turn to the east in order to reach the west. Since my father used always to speak of the \\\\'M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise way\\\\' as comprising the finest view of a plain that he knew anywhere, and of the \\\\'Guermantes way\\\\' as typical of river scenery, I had invested each of them, by conceiving them in this way as two distinct entities, with that cohesion, that unity which belongs only to the figments of the mind; the smallest detail of either of them appeared to me as a precious thing, which exhibited the special excellence of the whole, while, immediately beside them, in the first stages of our walk, before we had reached the sacred soil of one or the other, the purely material roads, at definite points on which they were set down as the ideal view over a plain and the ideal scenery of a river, were no more worth the trouble of looking at them than, to a keen playgoer and lover of dramatic art, are the little streets which may happen to run past the walls of a theatre. But, above all, I set between them, far more distinctly than the mere distance in miles and yards and inches which separated one from the other, the distance that there was between the two parts of my brain in which I used to think of them, one of those distances of the mind which time serves only to lengthen, which separate things irremediably from one another, keeping them for ever upon different planes. And this distinction was rendered still more absolute because the habit we had of never going both ways on the same day, or in the course of the same walk, but the \\\\'M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise way\\\\' one time and the \\\\'Guermantes way\\\\' another, shut them up, so to speak, far apart and unaware of each other\\\\'s existence, in the sealed vessels\\u2014between which there could be no communication\\u2014of separate afternoons  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0When we had decided to go the \\\\'M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise way\\\\' we would start without undue haste, and even if the sky were clouded over, since the walk was not very long, and did not take us too far from home, as though we were not going anywhere in particular, by the front-door of my aunt\\\\'s house, which opened on to the Rue du Saint-Esprit. We would be greeted by the gunsmith, we would drop our letters into the box, we would tell Th\\u00e9odore, from Fran\\u00e7oise, as we passed, that she had run out of oil or coffee, and we would leave the town by the road which ran along the white fence of M. Swann\\\\'s park. Before reaching it we would be met on our way by the scent of his lilac-trees, come out to welcome strangers. Out of the fresh little green hearts of their foliage the lilacs raised inquisitively over the fence of the park their plumes of white or purple blossom, which glowed, even in the shade, with the sunlight in which they had been bathed. Some of them, half-concealed by the little tiled house, called the Archers\\\\' Lodge, in which Swann\\\\'s keeper lived, overtopped its gothic gable with their rosy minaret. The nymphs of spring would have seemed coarse and vulgar in comparison with these young houris, who retained, in this French garden, the pure and vivid colouring of a Persian miniature. Despite my desire to throw my arms about their pliant forms and to draw down towards me the starry locks that crowned their fragrant heads, we would pass them by without stopping, for my parents had ceased to visit Tansonville since Swann\\\\'s marriage, and, so as not to appear to be looking into his park, we would, instead of taking the road which ran beside its boundary and then climbed straight up to the open fields, choose another way, which led in the same direction, but circuitously, and brought us out rather too far from home  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0One day my grandfather said to my \\\\'father: \\\"Don\\\\'t you remember Swann\\\\'s telling us yesterday that his wife and daughter had gone off to Rheims and that he was taking the opportunity of spending a day or two in Paris? We might go along by the park, since the ladies are not at home; that will make it a little shorter.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0We stopped for a moment by the fence. Lilac-time was nearly over; some of the trees still thrust aloft, in tall purple chandeliers, their tiny balls of blossom, but in many places among their foliage where, only a week before, they had still been breaking in waves of fragrant foam, these were now spent and shrivelled and discoloured, a hollow scum, dry and scentless. My grandfather pointed out to my father in what respects the appearance of the place was still the same, and how far it had altered since the walk that he had taken with old M. Swann, on the day of his wife\\\\'s death; and he seized the opportunity to tell us, once again, the story of that walk  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0In front of us a path bordered with nasturtiums rose in the full glare of the sun towards the house. But to our right the park stretched away into the distance, on level ground. Overshadowed by the tall trees which stood close around it, an \\\\'ornamental water\\\\' had been constructed by Swann\\\\'s parents but, even in his most artificial creations, nature is the material upon which man has to work; certain spots will persist in remaining surrounded by the vassals of their own especial sovereignty, and will raise their immemorial standards among all the \\\\'laid-out\\\\' scenery of a park, just as they would have done far from any human interference, in a solitude which must everywhere return to engulf them, springing up out of the necessities of their exposed position, and superimposing itself upon the work of man\\\\'s hands. And so it was that, at the foot of the path which led down to this artificial lake, there might be seen, in its two tiers woven of trailing forget-me-nots below and of periwinkle flowers above, the natural, delicate, blue garland which binds the luminous, shadowed brows of water-nymphs; while the iris, its swords sweeping every way in regal profusion, stretched out over agrimony and water-growing king-cups the lilied sceptres, tattered glories of yellow and purple, of the kingdom of the lake  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The absence of Mlle. Swann, which\\u2014since it preserved me from the terrible risk of seeing her appear on one of the paths, and of being identified and scorned by this so privileged little girl who had Bergotte for a friend and used to go with him to visit cathedrals\\u2014made the exploration of Tansonville, now for the first time permitted me, a matter of indifference to myself, seemed however to invest the property, in my grandfather\\\\'s and father\\\\'s eyes, with a fresh and transient charm, and like an entirely cloudless sky when one is going mountaineering to make the day extraordinarily propitious for a walk in this direction; I should have liked to see their reckoning proved false, to see, by a miracle, Mlle. Swann appear, with her father, so close to us that we should not have time to escape, and should therefore be obliged to make her acquaintance. And so, when I suddenly noticed a straw basket lying forgotten on the grass by the side of a line whose float was bobbing in the water, I made a great effort to keep my father and grandfather looking in another direction, away from this sign that she might, after all, be in residence. Still, as Swann had told us that he ought not, really, to go away just then, as he had some people staying in the house, the line might equally belong to one of these guests. Not a footstep was to be heard on any of the paths. Somewhere in one of the tall trees, making a stage in its height, an invisible bird, desperately attempting to make the day seem shorter, was exploring with a long, continuous note the solitude that pressed it on every side, but it received at once so unanimous an answer, so powerful a repercussion of silence and of immobility that, one would have said, it had arrested for all eternity the moment which it had been trying to make pass more quickly. The sunlight fell so implacably from a fixed sky that one was naturally inclined to slip away out of the reach of its attentions, and even the slumbering water, whose repose was perpetually being invaded by the insects that swarmed above its surface, while it dreamed, no doubt, of some imaginary maelstrom, intensified the uneasiness which the sight of that floating cork had wrought in me, by appearing to draw it at full speed across the silent reaches of a mirrored firmament; now almost vertical, it seemed on the point of plunging down out of sight, and I had begun to ask myself whether, setting aside the longing and the terror that I had of making her acquaintance, it was not actually my duty to warn Mlle. Swann that the fish was biting\\u2014when I was obliged to run after my father and grandfather, who were calling me, and were surprised that I had not followed them along the little path, climbing up hill towards the open fields, into which they had already turned. I found the whole path throbbing with the fragrance of hawthorn-blossom. The hedge resembled a series of chapels, whose walls were no longer visible under the mountains of flowers that were heaped upon their altars; while underneath, the sun cast a square of light upon the ground, as though it had shone in upon them through a window; the scent that swept out over me from them was as rich, and as circumscribed in its range, as though I had been standing before the Lady-altar, and the flowers, themselves adorned also, held out each its little bunch of glittering stamens with an air of inattention, fine, radiating \\\\'nerves\\\\' in the flamboyant style of architecture, like those which, in church, framed the stair to the rood-loft or closed the perpendicular tracery of the windows, but here spread out into pools of fleshy white, like strawberry-beds in spring. How simple and rustic, in comparison with these, would seem the dog-roses which, in a few weeks\\\\' time, would be climbing the same hillside path in the heat of the sun, dressed in the smooth silk of their blushing pink bodices, which would be undone and scattered by the first breath of wind  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0But it was in vain that I lingered before the hawthorns, to breathe in, to marshal before my mind which knew not what to make of it, to lose in order to rediscover their invisible and unchanging odour, to absorb myself in the rhythm which disposed their flowers here and there with the light-heartedness of youth, and at intervals as unexpected as certain intervals of music; they offered me an indefinite continuation of the same charm, in an inexhaustible profusion, but without letting me delve into it any more deeply, like those melodies which one can play over a hundred times in succession without coming any nearer to their secret. I turned away from them for a moment so as to be able to return to them with renewed strength. My eyes followed up the slope which, outside the hedge, rose steeply to the fields, a poppy that had strayed and been lost by its fellows, or a few cornflowers that had fallen lazily behind, and decorated the ground here and there with their flowers like the border of a tapestry, in which may be seen at intervals hints of the rustic theme which appears triumphant in the panel itself; infrequent still, spaced apart as the scattered houses which warn us that we are approaching a village, they betokened to me the vast expanse of waving corn beneath the fleecy clouds, and the sight of a single poppy hoisting upon its slender rigging and holding against the breeze its scarlet ensign, over the buoy of rich black earth from which it sprang, made my heart beat as does a wayfarer\\\\'s when he perceives, upon some low-lying ground, an old and broken boat which is being caulked and made seaworthy, and cries out, although he has not yet caught sight of it, \\\"The Sea!\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And then I returned to my hawthorns, and stood before them as one stands before those masterpieces of painting which, one imagines, one will be better able to \\\\'take in\\\\' when one has looked away, for a moment, at something else; but in vain did I shape my fingers into a frame, so as to have nothing but the hawthorns before my eyes; the sentiment which they aroused in me remained obscure and vague, struggling and failing to free itself, to float across and become one with the flowers. They themselves offered me no enlightenment, and I could not call upon any other flowers to satisfy this mysterious longing. And then, inspiring me with that rapture which we feel on seeing a work by our favourite painter quite different from any of those that we already know, or, better still, when some one has taken us and set us down in front of a picture of which we have hitherto seen no more than a pencilled sketch, or when a piece of music which we have heard played over on the piano bursts out again in our ears with all the splendour and fullness of an orchestra, my grandfather called me to him, and, pointing to the hedge of Tansonville, said: \\\"You are fond of hawthorns; just look at this pink one; isn\\\\'t it pretty?\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And it was indeed a hawthorn, but one whose flowers were pink, and lovelier even than the white. It, too, was in holiday attire, for one of those days which are the only true holidays, the holy days of religion, because they are not appointed by any capricious accident, as secular holidays are appointed, upon days which are not specially ordained for such observances, which have nothing about them that is essentially festal\\u2014but it was attired even more richly than the rest, for the flowers which clung to its branches, one above another, so thickly as to leave no part of the tree undecorated, like the tassels wreathed about the crook of a rococo shepherdess, were every one of them \\\\'in colour,\\\\' and consequently of a superior quality, by the aesthetic standards of Combray, to the \\\\'plain,\\\\' if one was to judge by the scale of prices at the \\\\'stores\\\\' in the Square, or at Camus\\\\'s, where the most expensive biscuits were those whose sugar was pink. And for my own part I set a higher value on cream cheese when it was pink, when I had been allowed to tinge it with crushed strawberries. And these flowers had chosen precisely the colour of some edible and delicious thing, or of some exquisite addition to one\\\\'s costume for a great festival, which colours, inasmuch as they make plain the reason for their superiority, are those whose beauty is most evident to the eyes of children, and for that reason must always seem more vivid and more natural than any other tints, even after the child\\\\'s mind has realised that they offer no gratification to the appetite, and have not been selected by the dressmaker. And, indeed, I had felt at once, as I had felt before the white blossom, but now still more marvelling, that it was in no artificial manner, by no device of human construction, that the festal intention of these flowers was revealed, but that it was Nature herself who had spontaneously expressed it with the simplicity of a woman from a village shop, labouring at the decoration of a street altar for some procession by burying the bush in these little rosettes, almost too ravishing in colour, this rustic \\\\'pompadour.\\\\' High up on the branches, like so many of those tiny rose-trees, their pots concealed in jackets of paper lace, whose slender stems rise in a forest from the altar on the greater festivals, a thousand buds were swelling and opening, paler in colour, but each disclosing as it burst, as at the bottom of a cup of pink marble, its blood-red stain, and suggesting even more strongly than the full-blown flowers the special, irresistible quality of the hawthorn-tree, which, wherever it budded, wherever it was about to blossom, could bud and blossom in pink flowers alone. Taking its place in the hedge, but as different from the rest as a young girl in holiday attire among a crowd of dowdy women in everyday clothes, who are staying at home, equipped and ready for the \\\\'Month of Mary,\\\\' of which it seemed already to form a part, it shone and smiled in its cool, rosy garments, a Catholic bush indeed, and altogether delightful  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The hedge allowed us a glimpse, inside the park, of an alley bordered with jasmine, pansies, and verbenas, among which the stocks held open their fresh plump purses, of a pink as fragrant and as faded as old Spanish leather, while on the gravel-path a long watering-pipe, painted green, coiling across the ground, poured, where its holes were, over the flowers whose perfume those holes inhaled, a vertical and prismatic fan of infinitesimal, rainbow-coloured drops. Suddenly I stood still, unable to move, as happens when something appears that requires not only our eyes to take it in, but involves a deeper kind of perception and takes possession of the whole of our being. A little girl, with fair, reddish hair, who appeared to be returning from a walk, and held a trowel in her hand, was looking at us, raising towards us a face powdered with pinkish freckles. Her black eyes gleamed, and as I did not at that time know, and indeed have never since learned how to reduce to its objective elements any strong impression, since I had not, as they say, enough \\\\'power of observation\\\\' to isolate the sense of their colour, for a long time afterwards, whenever I thought of her, the memory of those bright eyes would at once present itself to me as a vivid azure, since her complexion was fair; so much so that, perhaps, if her eyes had not been quite so black\\u2014which was what struck one most forcibly on first meeting her\\u2014I should not have been, as I was, especially enamoured of their imagined blue  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0I gazed at her, at first with that gaze which is not merely a messenger from the eyes, but in whose window all the senses assemble and lean out, petrified and anxious, that gaze which would fain reach, touch, capture, bear off in triumph the body at which it is aimed, and the soul with the body; then so frightened was I lest at any moment my grandfather and father, catching sight of the girl, might tear me away from her, by making me run on in front of them with another, an unconsciously appealing look, whose object was to force her to pay attention to me, to see, to know me. She cast a glance forwards and sideways, so as to take stock of my grandfather and father, and doubtless the impression she formed of them was that we were all absurd people, for she turned away with an indifferent and contemptuous air, withdrew herself so as to spare her face the indignity of remaining within their field of vision; and while they, continuing to walk on without noticing her, had overtaken and passed me, she allowed her eyes to wander, over the space that lay between us, in my direction, without any particular expression, without appearing to have seen me, but with an intensity, a half-hidden smile which I was unable to interpret, according to the instruction I had received in the ways of good breeding, save as a mark of infinite disgust; and her hand, at the same time, sketched in the air an indelicate gesture, for which, when it was addressed in public to a person whom one did not know, the little dictionary of manners which I carried in my mind supplied only one meaning, namely, a deliberate insult  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Gilberte, come along; what are you doing?\\\" called out in a piercing tone of authority a lady in white, whom I had not seen until that moment, while, a little way beyond her, a gentleman in a suit of linen \\\\'ducks,\\\\' whom I did not know either, stared at me with eyes which seemed to be starting from his head; the little girl\\\\'s smile abruptly faded, and, seizing her trowel, she made off without turning to look again in my direction, with an air of obedience, inscrutable and sly  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And so was wafted to my ears the name of Gilberte, bestowed on me like a talisman which might, perhaps, enable me some day to rediscover her whom its syllables had just endowed with a definite personality, whereas, a moment earlier, she had been only something vaguely seen. So it came to me, uttered across the heads of the stocks and jasmines, pungent and cool as the drops which fell from the green watering-pipe; impregnating and irradiating the zone of pure air through which it had passed, which it set apart and isolated from all other air, with the mystery of the life of her whom its syllables designated to the happy creatures that lived and walked and travelled in her company; unfolding through the arch of the pink hawthorn, which opened at the height of my shoulder, the quintessence of their familiarity\\u2014so exquisitely painful to myself\\u2014with her, and with all that unknown world of her existence, into which I should never penetrate  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0For a moment while we moved away, and my grandfather murmured: \\\"Poor Swann, what a life they are leading him; fancy sending him away so that she can be left alone with her Charlus\\u2014for that was Charlus: I recognised him at once! And the child, too; at her age, to be mixed up in all that!\\\" the impression left on me by the despotic tone in which Gilberte\\\\'s mother had spoken to her, without her replying, by exhibiting her to me as being obliged to yield obedience to some one else, as not being indeed superior to the whole world, calmed my sufferings somewhat, revived some hope in me, and cooled the ardour of my love. But very soon that love surged up again in me like a reaction by which my humiliated heart was endeavouring to rise to Gilberte\\\\'s level, or to draw her down to its own. I loved her; I was sorry not to have had the time and the inspiration to insult her, to do her some injury, to force her to keep some memory of me. I knew her to be so beautiful that I should have liked to be able to retrace my steps so as to shake my fist at her and shout, \\\"I think you are hideous, grotesque; you are utterly disgusting!\\\" However, I walked away, carrying with me, then and for ever afterwards, as the first illustration of a type of happiness rendered inaccessible to a little boy of my kind by certain laws of nature which it was impossible to transgress, the picture of a little girl with reddish hair, and a skin freckled with tiny pink marks, who held a trowel in her hand, and smiled as she directed towards me a long and subtle and inexpressive stare. And already the charm with which her name, like a cloud of incense, had filled that archway in the pink hawthorn through which she and I had, together, heard its sound, was beginning to conquer, to cover, to embalm, to beautify everything with which it had any association: her grandparents, whom my own had been so unspeakably fortunate as to know, the glorious profession of a stockholder, even the melancholy neighbourhood of the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es, where she lived in Paris.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"L\\u00e9onie,\\\" said my grandfather on our return, \\\"I wish we had had you with us this afternoon. You would never have known Tansonville. If I had had the courage I would have cut you a branch of that pink hawthorn you used to like so much.\\\" And so my grandfather told her the story of our walk, either just to amuse her, or perhaps because there was still some hope that she might be stimulated to rise from her bed and to go out of doors. For in earlier days she had been very fond of Tansonville, and, moreover, Swann\\\\'s visits had been the last that she had continued to receive, at a time when she had already closed her doors to all the world. And just as, when he called, in these later days, to inquire for her and she was still the only person in our household whom he would ask to see, she would send down to say that she was tired at the moment and resting, but that she would be happy to see him another time, so, this evening, she said to my grandfather, \\\"Yes, some day when the weather is fine I shall go for a drive as far as the gate of the park.\\\" And in saying this she was quite sincere. She would have liked to see Swann and Tansonville again; but the mere wish to do so sufficed for all that remained of her strength, which its fulfilment would have more than exhausted. Sometimes a spell of fine weather made her a little more energetic, she would rise and put on her clothes; but before she had reached the outer room she would be \\\\'tired\\\\' again, and would insist on returning to her bed. The process which had begun in her\\u2014and in her a little earlier only than it must come to all of us\\u2014was the great and general renunciation which old age makes in preparation for death, the chrysalis stage of life, which may be observed wherever life has been unduly prolonged; even in old lovers who have lived for one another with the utmost intensity of passion, and in old friends bound by the closest ties of mental sympathy, who, after a certain year, cease to make, the necessary journey, or even to cross the street to see one another, cease to correspond, and know well that they will communicate no more in this world. My aunt must have been perfectly well aware that she would not see Swann again, that she would never leave her own house any more, but this ultimate seclusion seemed to be accepted by her with all the more readiness for the very reason which, to our minds, ought to have made it more unbearable; namely, that such a seclusion was forced upon her by the gradual and steady diminution in her strength which she was able to measure daily, which, by making every action, every movement \\\\'tiring\\\\' to her if not actually painful, gave to inaction, isolation and silence the blessed, strengthening and refreshing charm of repose.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0My aunt did not go to see the pink hawthorn in the hedge, but at all hours of the day I would ask the rest of my family whether she was not going to go, whether she used not, at one time, to go often to Tansonville, trying to make them speak of Mile. Swann\\\\'s parents and grandparents, who appeared to me to be as great and glorious as gods. The name, which had for me become almost mythological, of Swann\\u2014when I talked with my family I would grow sick with longing to hear them utter it; I dared not pronounce it myself, but I would draw them into a discussion of matters which led naturally to Gilberte and her family, in which she was involved, in speaking of which I would feel myself not too remotely banished from her company; and I would suddenly force my father by pretending, for instance, to believe that my grandfather\\\\'s business had been in our family before his day, or that the hedge with the pink hawthorn which my aunt L\\u00e9onie wished to visit was on common ground to correct my statements, to say, as though in opposition to me and of his own accord: \\\"No, no, the business belonged to Swann\\\\'s father, that hedge is part of Swann\\\\'s park.\\\" And then I would be obliged to pause for breath; so stifling was the pressure, upon that part of me where it was for ever inscribed, of that name which, at the moment when I heard it, seemed to me fuller, more portentous than any other name, because it was burdened with the weight of all the occasions on which I had secretly uttered it in my mind. It caused me a pleasure which I was ashamed to have dared to demand from my parents, for so great was it that to have procured it for me must have involved them in an immensity of effort, and with no recompense, since for them there was no pleasure in the sound. And so I would prudently turn the conversation. And by a scruple of conscience, also. All the singular seductions which I had stored up in the sound of that word Swann, I found again as soon as it was uttered. And then it occurred to me suddenly that my parents could not fail to experience the same emotions, that they must find themselves sharing my point of view, that they perceived in their turn, that they condoned, that they even embraced my visionary longings, and I was as wretched as though I had ravished and corrupted the innocence of their hearts.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0That year my family fixed the day of their return to Paris rather earlier than usual. On the morning of our departure I had had my hair curled, to be ready to face the photographer, had had a new hat carefully set upon my head, and had been buttoned into a velvet jacket; a little later my mother, after searching everywhere for me, found me standing in tears on that steep little hillside close to Tansonville, bidding a long farewell to my hawthorns, clasping their sharp branches to my bosom, and like a princess in a tragedy, oppressed by the weight of all her senseless jewellery with no gratitude towards the officious hand which had, in curling those ringlets, been at pains to collect all my hair upon my forehead; trampling underfoot the curl-papers which I had torn from my head, and my new hat with them. My mother was not at all moved by my tears, but she could not suppress a cry at the sight of my battered headgear and my ruined jacket. I did not, however, hear her. \\\"Oh, my poor little hawthorns,\\\" I was assuring them through my sobs, \\\"it is not you that want to make me unhappy, to force me to leave you. You, you have never done me any harm. So I shall always love you.\\\" And, drying my eyes, I promised them that, when I grew up, I would never copy the foolish example of other men, but that even in Paris, on fine spring days, instead of paying calls and listening to silly talk, I would make excursions into the country to see the first hawthorn-trees in bloom.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Once in the fields we never left them again during the rest of our M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise walk. They were perpetually crossed, as though by invisible streams of traffic, by the wind, which was to me the tutelary genius of Combray. Every year, on the day of our arrival, in order to feel that I really was at Combray, I would climb the hill to find it running again through my clothing, and setting me running in its wake. One always had the wind for companion when one went the \\\\'M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise way,\\\\' on that swelling plain which stretched, mile beyond mile, without any disturbance of its gentle contour. I knew that Mlle. Swann used often to go and spend a few days at Laon, and, for all that it was many miles away, the distance was obviated by the absence of any intervening obstacle; when, on hot afternoons, I would see a breath of wind emerge from the farthest horizon, bowing the heads of the corn in distant fields, pouring like a flood over all that vast expanse, and finally settling down, warm and rustling, among the clover and sainfoin at my feet, that plain which was common to us both seemed then to draw us together, to unite us; I would imagine that the same breath had passed by her also, that there was some message from her in what it was whispering to me, without my being able to understand it, and I would catch and kiss it as it passed. On my left was a village called Champieu Campus Pagani, according to the Cur\\u00e9. On my right I could see across the cornfields the two crocketed, rustic spires of Saint-Andr\\u00e9-des-Champs, themselves as tapering, scaly, plated, honeycombed, yellowed, and roughened as two ears of wheat.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0At regular intervals, among the inimitable ornamentation of their leaves, which can be mistaken for those of no other fruit-tree, the apple-trees were exposing their broad petals of white satin, or hanging in shy bunches their unopened, blushing buds. It was while going the \\\\'M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise way\\\\' that I first noticed the circular shadow which apple-trees cast upon the sunlit ground, and also those impalpable threads of golden silk which the setting sun weaves slantingly downwards from beneath their leaves, and which I would see my father slash through with his stick without ever making them swerve from their straight path.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Sometimes in the afternoon sky a white moon would creep up like a little cloud, furtive, without display, suggesting an actress who does not have to \\\\'come on\\\\' for a while, and so goes \\\\'in front\\\\' in her ordinary clothes to watch the rest of the company for a moment, but keeps in the background, not wishing to attract attention to herself. I was glad to find her image reproduced in books and paintings, though these works of art were very different\\u2014at least in my earlier years, before Bloch had attuned my eyes and mind to more subtle harmonies\\u2014from those in which the moon seems fair to me to-day, but in which I should not have recognised her then. It might be, for instance, some novel by Saintine, some landscape by Gleyre, in which she is cut out sharply against the sky, in the form of a silver sickle, some work as unsophisticated and as incomplete as were, at that date, my own impressions, and which it enraged my grandmother\\\\'s sisters to see me admire. They held that one ought to set before children, and that children shewed their own innate good taste in admiring, only such books and pictures as they would continue to admire when their minds were developed and mature. No doubt they regarded aesthetic values as material objects which an unclouded vision could not fail to discern, without needing to have their equivalent in experience of life stored up and slowly ripening in one\\\\'s heart.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0It was along the \\\\'M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise way,\\\\' at Montjouvain, a house built on the edge of a large pond, and overlooked by a steep, shrub-grown hill, that M. Vinteuil lived. And so we used often to meet his daughter driving her dogcart at full speed along the road. After a certain year we never saw her alone, but always accompanied by a friend, a girl older than herself, with an evil reputation in the neighbourhood, who in the end installed herself permanently, one day, at Montjouvain. People said: \\\"That poor M. Vinteuil must be blinded by love not to see what everyone is talking about, and to let his daughter\\u2014a man who is horrified if you use a word in the wrong sense\\u2014bring a woman like that to live under his roof. He says that she is a most superior woman, with a heart of gold, and that she would have shewn extraordinary musical talent if she had only been trained. He may be sure it is not music that she is teaching his daughter.\\\" But M. Vinteuil assured them that it was, and indeed it is remarkable that people never fail to arouse admiration of their normal qualities in the relatives of anyone with whom they are in physical intercourse. Bodily passion, which has been so unjustly decried, compels its victims to display every vestige that is in them of unselfishness and generosity, and so effectively that they shine resplendent in the eyes of all beholders. Dr. Percepied, whose loud voice and bushy eyebrows enabled him to play to his heart\\\\'s content the part of \\\\'double-dealer,\\\\' a part to which he was not, otherwise, adapted, without in the least degree compromising his unassailable and quite unmerited reputation of being a kind-hearted old curmudgeon, could make the Cur\\u00e9 and everyone else laugh until they cried by saying in a harsh voice: \\\"What d\\\\'ye say to this, now? It seems that she plays music with her friend, Mile. Vinteuil. That surprises you, does it? Oh, I know nothing, nothing at all. It was Papa Vinteuil who told me all about it yesterday. After all, she has every right to be fond of music, that girl. I should never dream of thwarting the artistic vocation of a child; nor Vinteuil either, it seems. And then he plays music too, with his daughter\\\\'s friend. Why, gracious heavens, it must be a regular musical box, that house out there! What are you laughing at? I say they\\\\'ve been playing too much music, those people. I met Papa Vinteuil the other day, by the cemetery. It was all he could do to keep on his feet.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Anyone who, like ourselves, had seen M. Vinteuil, about this time, avoiding people whom he knew, and turning away as soon as he caught sight of them, changed in a few months into an old man, engulfed in a sea of sorrows, incapable of any effort not directly aimed at promoting his daughter\\\\'s happiness, spending whole days beside his wife\\\\'s grave, could hardly have failed to realise that he was gradually dying of a broken heart, could hardly have supposed that he paid no attention to the rumours which were going about. He knew, perhaps he even believed, what his neighbours were saying. There is probably no one, however rigid his virtue, who is not liable to find himself, by the complexity of circumstances, living at close quarters with the very vice which he himself has been most outspoken in condemning, without at first recognising it beneath the disguise which it assumes on entering his presence, so as to wound him and to make him suffer; the odd words, the unaccountable attitude, one evening, of a person whom he has a thousand reasons for loving. But for a man of M. Vinteuil\\\\'s sensibility it must have been far more painful than for a hardened man of the world to have to resign himself to one of those situations which are wrongly supposed to occur in Bohemian circles only; for they are produced whenever there needs to establish itself in the security necessary to its development a vice which Nature herself has planted in the soul of a child, perhaps by no more than blending the virtues of its father and mother, as she might blend the colours of their eyes. And yet however much M. Vinteuil may have known of his daughter\\\\'s conduct it did not follow that his adoration of her grew any less. The facts of life do not penetrate to the sphere in which our beliefs are cherished; as it was not they that engendered those beliefs, so they are powerless to destroy them; they can aim at them continual blows of contradiction and disproof without weakening them; and an avalanche of miseries and maladies coming, one after another, without interruption into the bosom of a family, will not make it lose faith in either the clemency of its God or the capacity of its physician. But when M. Vinteuil regarded his daughter and himself from the point of view of the world, and of their reputation, when he attempted to place himself by her side in the rank which they occupied in the general estimation of their neighbours, then he was bound to give judgment, to utter his own and her social condemnation in precisely the terms which the inhabitant of Combray most hostile to him and his daughter would have employed; he saw himself and her in \\\\'low,\\\\' in the very \\\\'lowest water,\\\\' inextricably stranded; and his manners had of late been tinged with that humility, that respect for persons who ranked above him and to whom he must now look up however far beneath him they might hitherto have been, that tendency to search for some means of rising again to their level, which is an almost mechanical result of any human misfortune.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0One day, when we were walking with Swann in one of the streets of Combray, M. Vinteuil, turning out of another street, found himself so suddenly face to face with us all that he had not time to escape; and Swann, with that almost arrogant charity of a man of the world who, amid the dissolution of all his own moral prejudices, finds in another\\\\'s shame merely a reason for treating him with a friendly benevolence, the outward signs of which serve to enhance and gratify the self-esteem of the bestower because he feels that they are all the more precious to him upon whom they are bestowed, conversed at great length with M. Vinteuil, with whom for a long time he had been barely on speaking terms, and invited him, before leaving us, to send his daughter over, one day, to play at Tansonville. It was an invitation which, two years earlier, would have enraged M. Vinteuil, but which now filled him with so much gratitude that he felt himself obliged to refrain from the indiscretion of accepting. Swann\\\\'s friendly regard for his daughter seemed to him to be in itself so honourable, so precious a support for his cause that he felt it would perhaps be better to make no use of it, so as to have the wholly Platonic satisfaction of keeping it in reserve.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"What a charming man!\\\" he said to us, after Swann had gone, with the same enthusiasm and veneration which make clever and pretty women of the middle classes fall victims to the physical and intellectual charms of a duchess, even though she be ugly and a fool. \\\"What a charming man! What a pity that he should have made such a deplorable marriage!\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And then, so strong an element of hypocrisy is there in even the most sincere of men, who cast off, while they are talking to anyone, the opinion they actually hold of him and will express when he is no longer there, my family joined with M. Vinteuil in deploring Swann\\\\'s marriage, invoking principles and conventions which all the more because they invoked them in common with him, as though we were all thorough good fellows of the same sort they appeared to suggest were in no way infringed at Montjouvain. M. Vinteuil did not send his daughter to visit Swann, an omission which Swann was the first to regret. For constantly, after meeting M. Vinteuil, he would remember that he had been meaning for a long time to ask him about some one of the same name as himself, one of his relatives, Swann supposed. And on this occasion he determined that he would not forget what he had to say to him when M. Vinteuil should appear with his daughter at Tansonville.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Since the \\\\'M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise way\\\\' was the shorter of the two that we used to take for our walks round Combray, and for that reason was reserved for days of uncertain weather, it followed that the climate of M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise shewed an unduly high rainfall, and we would never lose sight of the fringe of Roussainville wood, so that we could, at any moment, run for shelter beneath its dense thatch of leaves.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Often the sun would disappear behind a cloud, which impinged on its roundness, but whose edge the sun gilded in return. The brightness, though not the light of day, would then be shut off from a landscape in which all life appeared to be suspended, while the little village of Roussainville carved in relief upon the sky the white mass of its gables, with a startling precision of detail. A gust of wind blew from its perch a rook, which floated away and settled in the distance, while beneath a paling sky the woods on the horizon assumed a deeper tone of blue, as though they were painted in one of those cameos which you still find decorating the walls of old houses.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0But on other days would begin to fall the rain, of which we had had due warning from the little barometer-figure which the spectacle-maker hung out in his doorway. Its drops, like migrating birds which fly off in a body at a given moment, would come down out of the sky in close marching order. They would never drift apart, would make no movement at random in their rapid course, but each one, keeping in its place, would draw after it the drop which was following, and the sky would be as greatly darkened as by the swallows flying south. We would take refuge among the trees. And when it seemed that their flight was accomplished, a few last drops, feebler and slower than the rest, would still come down. But we would emerge from our shelter, for the rain was playing a game, now, among the branches, and, even when it was almost dry again underfoot, a stray drop or two, lingering in the hollow of a leaf, would run down and hang glistening from the point of it until suddenly it splashed plump upon our upturned faces from the whole height of the tree.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Often, too, we would hurry for shelter, tumbling in among all its stony saints and patriarchs, into the porch of Saint-Andr\\u00e9-des-Champs, How typically French that church was! Over its door the saints, the kings of chivalry with lilies in their hands, the wedding scenes and funerals were carved as they might have been in the mind of Fran\\u00e7oise. The sculptor had also recorded certain anecdotes of Aristotle and Virgil, precisely as Fran\\u00e7oise in her kitchen would break into speech about Saint Louis as though she herself had known him, generally in order to depreciate, by contrast with him, my grandparents, whom she considered less \\\\'righteous.\\\\' One could see that the ideas which the mediaeval artist and the mediaeval peasant who had survived to cook for us in the nineteenth century had of classical and of early Christian history, ideas whose inaccuracy was atoned for by their honest simplicity, were derived not from books, but from a tradition at once ancient and direct, unbroken, oral, degraded, unrecognisable, and alive. Another Combray person whom I could discern also, potential and typified, in the gothic sculptures of Saint-Andr\\u00e9-des-Champs was young Th\\u00e9odore, the assistant in Camus\\\\'s shop. And, indeed, Fran\\u00e7oise herself was well aware that she had in him a countryman and contemporary, for when my aunt was too ill for Fran\\u00e7oise to be able, unaided, to lift her in her bed or to carry her to her chair, rather than let the kitchen-maid come upstairs and, perhaps, \\\\'make an impression\\\\' on my aunt, she would send out for Th\\u00e9odore. And this lad, who was regarded, and quite rightly, in the town as a \\\\'bad character,\\\\' was so abounding in that spirit which had served to decorate the porch of Saint-Andr\\u00e9-des-Champs, and particularly in the feelings of respect due, in Fran\\u00e7oise eyes, to all \\\\'poor invalids,\\\\' and, above all, to her own \\\\'poor mistress,\\\\' that he had, when he bent down to raise my aunt\\\\'s head from her pillow, the same air of pr\\u00e9rapha\\u00e9lite simplicity and zeal which the little angels in the bas-reliefs wear, who throng, with tapers in their hands, about the deathbed of Our Lady, as though those carved faces of stone, naked and grey like trees in winter, were, like them, asleep only, storing up life and waiting to flower again in countless plebeian faces, reverend and cunning as the face of Th\\u00e9odore, and glowing with the ruddy brilliance of ripe apples.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0There, too, not fastened to the wall like the little angels, but detached from the porch, of more than human stature, erect upon her pedestal as upon a footstool, which had been placed there to save her feet from contact with the wet ground, stood a saint with the full cheeks, the firm breasts which swelled out inside her draperies like a cluster of ripe grapes inside a bag, the narrow forehead, short and stubborn nose, deep-set eyes, and strong, thick-skinned, courageous expression of the country-women of those parts. This similarity, which imparted to the statue itself a kindliness that I had not looked to find in it, was corroborated often by the arrival of some girl from the fields, come, like ourselves, for shelter beneath the porch, whose presence there\\u2014as when the leaves of a climbing plant have grown up beside leaves carved in stone\\u2014seemed intended by fate to allow us, by confronting it with its type in nature, to form a critical estimate of the truth of the work of art. Before our eyes, in the distance, a promised or an accursed land, Roussainville, within whose walls I had never penetrated, Roussainville was now, when the rain had ceased for us, still being chastised, like a village in the Old Testament, by all the innumerable spears and arrows of the storm, which beat down obliquely upon the dwellings of its inhabitants, or else had already received the forgiveness of the Almighty, Who had restored to it the light of His sun, which fell upon it in rays of uneven length, like the rays of a monstrance upon an altar.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Sometimes, when the weather had completely broken, we were obliged to go home and to remain shut up indoors. Here and there, in the distance, in a landscape which, what with the failing light and saturated atmosphere, resembled a seascape rather, a few solitary houses clinging to the lower slopes of a hill whose heights were buried in a cloudy darkness shone out like little boats which had folded their sails and would ride at anchor, all night, upon the sea. But what mattered rain or storm? In summer, bad weather is no more than a passing fit of superficial ill-temper expressed by the permanent, underlying fine weather; a very different thing from the fluid and unstable \\\\'fine weather\\\\' of winter, its very opposite, in fact; for has it not firmly established in the soil, on which it has taken solid form in dense masses of foliage over which the rain may pour in torrents without weakening the resistance offered by their real and lasting happiness hoisted, to keep them flying throughout the season, in the village streets, on the walls of the houses and in their gardens, its silken banners, violet and white. Sitting in the little parlour, where I would pass the time until dinner with a book, I might hear the water dripping from our chestnut-trees, but I would know that the shower would only glaze and brighten the greenness of their thick, crumpled leaves, and that they themselves had undertaken to remain there, like pledges of summer, all through the rainy night, to assure me of the fine weather\\\\'s continuing; it might rain as it pleased, but to-morrow, over the white fence of Tansonville, there would surge and flow, numerous as ever, a sea of little heart-shaped leaves; and without the least anxiety I could watch the poplar in the Rue des Perchamps praying for mercy, bowing in desperation before the storm; without the least anxiety I could hear, at the far end of the garden, the last peals of thunder growling among our lilac-trees.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0If the weather was bad all morning, my family would abandon the idea of a walk, and I would remain at home. But, later on, I formed the habit of going out by myself on such days, and walking towards M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise-la-Vineuse, during that autumn when we had to come to Combray to settle the division of my aunt L\\u00e9onie\\\\'s estate; for she had died at last, leaving both parties among her neighbours triumphant in the fact of her demise\\u2014those who had insisted that her mode of life was enfeebling and must ultimately kill her, and, equally, those who had always maintained that she suffered from some disease not imaginary, but organic, by the visible proof of which the most sceptical would be obliged to own themselves convinced, once she had succumbed to it; causing no intense grief to any save one of her survivors, but to that one a grief savage in its violence. During the long fortnight of my aunt\\\\'s last illness Fran\\u00e7oise never went out of her room for an instant, never took off her clothes, allowed no one else to do anything for my aunt, and did not leave her body until it was actually in its grave. Then, at last, we understood that the sort of terror in which Fran\\u00e7oise had lived of my aunt\\\\'s harsh words, her suspicions and her anger, had developed in her a sentiment which we had mistaken for hatred, and which was really veneration and love. Her true mistress, whose decisions it had been impossible to foresee, from whose stratagems it had been so hard to escape, of whose good nature it had been so easy to take advantage, her sovereign, her mysterious and omnipotent monarch was no more. Compared with such a mistress we counted for very little. The time had long passed when, on our first coming to spend our holidays at Combray, we had been of equal importance, in Fran\\u00e7oise eyes, with my aunt.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0During that autumn my parents, finding the days so fully occupied with the legal formalities that had to be gone through, and discussions with solicitors and farmers, that they had little time for walks which, as it happened, the weather made precarious, began to let me go, without them, along the \\\\'M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise way,\\\\' wrapped up in a huge Highland plaid which protected me from the rain, and which I was all the more ready to throw over my shoulders because I felt that the stripes of its gaudy tartan scandalised Fran\\u00e7oise, whom it was impossible to convince that the colour of one\\\\'s clothes had nothing whatever to do with one\\\\'s mourning for the dead, and to whom the grief which we had shewn on my aunt\\\\'s death was wholly unsatisfactory, since we had not entertained the neighbours to a great funeral banquet, and did not adopt a special tone when we spoke of her, while I at times might be heard humming a tune. I am sure that in a book\\u2014and to that extent my feelings were closely akin to those of Fran\\u00e7oise\\u2014such a conception of mourning, in the manner of the Chanson de Roland and of the porch of Saint-Andr\\u00e9-des-Champs, would have seemed most attractive. But the moment that Fran\\u00e7oise herself approached, some evil spirit would urge me to attempt to make her angry, and I would avail myself of the slightest pretext to say to her that I regretted my aunt\\\\'s death because she had been a good woman in spite of her absurdities, but not in the least because she was my aunt; that she might easily have been my aunt and yet have been so odious that her death would not have caused me a moment\\\\'s sorrow; statements which, in a book, would have struck me as merely fatuous.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And if Fran\\u00e7oise then, inspired like a poet with a flood of confused reflections upon bereavement, grief, and family memories, were to plead her inability to rebut my theories, saying: \\\"I don\\\\'t know how to espress myself\\\"\\u2014I would triumph over her with an ironical and brutal common sense worthy of Dr. Percepied; and if she went on: \\\"All the same she was a geological relation; there is always the respect due to your geology,\\\" I would shrug my shoulders and say: \\\"It is really very good of me to discuss the matter with an illiterate old woman who cannot speak her own language,\\\" adopting, to deliver judgment on Fran\\u00e7oise, the mean and narrow outlook of the pedant, whom those who are most contemptuous of him in the impartiality of their own minds are only too prone to copy when they are obliged to play a part upon the vulgar stage of life.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0My walks, that autumn, were all the more delightful because I used to take them after long hours spent over a book. When I was tired of reading, after a whole morning in the house, I would throw my plaid across my shoulders and set out; my body, which in a long spell of enforced immobility had stored up an accumulation of vital energy, was now obliged, like a spinning-top wound and let go, to spend this in every direction. The walls of houses, the Tansonville hedge, the trees of Roussainville wood, the bushes against which Montjouvain leaned its back, all must bear the blows of my walking-stick or umbrella, must hear my shouts of happiness, blows and shouts being indeed no more than expressions of the confused ideas which exhilarated me, and which, not being developed to the point at which they might rest exposed to the light of day, rather than submit to a slow and difficult course of elucidation, found it easier and more pleasant to drift into an immediate outlet. And so it is that the bulk of what appear to be the emotional renderings of our inmost sensations do no more than relieve us of the burden of those sensations by allowing them to escape from us in an indistinct form which does not teach us how it should be interpreted. When I attempt to reckon up all that I owe to the \\\\'M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise way,\\\\' all the humble discoveries of which it was either the accidental setting or the direct inspiration and cause, I am reminded that it was in that same autumn, on one of those walks, near the bushy precipice which guarded Montjouvain from the rear, that I was struck for the first time by this lack of harmony between our impressions and their normal forms of expression. After an hour of rain and wind, against which I had put up a brisk fight, as I came to the edge of the Montjouvain pond, and reached a little hut, roofed with tiles, in which M. Vinteuil\\\\'s gardener kept his tools, the sun shone out again, and its golden rays, washed clean by the shower, blazed once more in the sky, on the trees, on the wall of the hut, and on the still wet tiles of the roof, which had a chicken perching upon its ridge. The wind pulled out sideways the wild grass that grew in the wall, and the chicken\\\\'s downy feathers, both of which things let themselves float upon the wind\\\\'s breath to their full extent, with the unresisting submissiveness of light and lifeless matter. The tiled roof cast upon the pond, whose reflections were now clear again in the sunlight, a square of pink marble, the like of which I had never observed before. And, seeing upon the water, where it reflected the wall, a pallid smile responding to the smiling sky, I cried aloud in my enthusiasm, brandishing my furled umbrella: \\\"Damn, damn, damn, damn!\\\" But at the same time I felt that I was in duty bound not to content myself with these unilluminating words, but to endeavour to see more clearly into the sources of my enjoyment.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And it was at that moment, too\\u2014thanks to a peasant who went past, apparently in a bad enough humour already, but more so when he nearly received my umbrella in his face, and who replied without any cordiality to my \\\"Fine day, what! good to be out walking!\\\"\\u2014that I learned that identical emotions do not spring up in the hearts of all men simultaneously, by a pre-established order. Later on I discovered that, whenever I had read for too long and was in a mood for conversation, the friend to whom I would be burning to say something would at that moment have finished indulging himself in the delights of conversation, and wanted nothing now but to be left to read undisturbed. And if I had been thinking with affection of my parents, and forming the most sensible and proper plans for giving them pleasure, they would have been using the same interval of time to discover some misdeed that I had already forgotten, and would begin to scold me severely, just as I flung myself upon them with a kiss.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Sometimes to the exhilaration which I derived from being alone would be added an alternative feeling, so that I could not be clear in my mind to which I should give the casting vote; a feeling stimulated by the desire to see rise up before my eyes a peasant-girl whom I might clasp in my arms. Coming abruptly, and without giving me time to trace it accurately to its source among so many ideas of a very different kind, the pleasure which accompanied this desire seemed only a degree superior to what was given me by my other thoughts. I found an additional merit in everything that was in my mind at the moment, in the pink reflection of the tiled roof, the wild grass in the wall, the village of Roussainville into which I had long desired to penetrate, the trees of its wood and the steeple of its church, created in them by this fresh emotion which made them appear more desirable only because I thought it was they that had provoked it, and which seemed only to wish to bear me more swiftly towards them when it filled my sails with a potent, unknown, and propitious breeze. But if this desire that a woman should appear added for me something more exalting than the charms of nature, they in their turn enlarged what I might, in the woman\\\\'s charm, have found too much restricted. It seemed to me that the beauty of the trees was hers also, and that, as for the spirit of those horizons, of the village of Roussainville, of the books which I was reading that year, it was her kiss which would make me master of them all; and, my imagination drawing strength from contact with my sensuality, my sensuality expanding through all the realms of my imagination, my desire had no longer any bounds. Moreover\\u2014just as in moments of musing contemplation of nature, the normal actions of the mind being suspended, and our abstract ideas of things set on one side, we believe with the profoundest faith in the originality, in the individual existence of the place in which we may happen to be\\u2014the passing figure which my desire evoked seemed to be not any one example of the general type of \\\\'woman,\\\\' but a necessary and natural product of the soil. For at that time everything which was not myself, the earth and the creatures upon it, seemed to me more precious, more important, endowed with a more real existence than they appear to full-grown men. And between the earth and its creatures I made no distinction. I had a desire for a peasant-girl from M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise or Roussainville, for a fisher-girl from Balbec, just as I had a desire for Balbec and M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise. The pleasure which those girls were empowered to give me would have seemed less genuine, I should have had no faith in it any longer, if I had been at liberty to modify its conditions as I chose. To meet in Paris a fisher-girl from Balbec or a peasant-girl from M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise would have been like receiving the present of a shell which I had never seen upon the beach, or of a fern which I had never found among the woods, would have stripped from the pleasure which she was about to give me all those other pleasures in the thick of which my imagination had enwrapped her. But to wander thus among the woods of Roussainville without a peasant-girl to embrace was to see those woods and yet know nothing of their secret treasure, their deep-hidden beauty. That girl whom I never saw save dappled with the shadows of their leaves, was to me herself a plant of local growth, only taller than the rest, and one whose structure would enable me to approach more closely than in them to the intimate savour of the land from which she had sprung. I could believe this all the more readily and also that the caresses by which she would bring that savour to my senses were themselves of a particular kind, yielding a pleasure which I could never derive from any but herself since I was still, and must for long remain, in that period of life when one has not yet separated the fact of this sensual pleasure from the various women in whose company one has tasted it, when one has not reduced it to a general idea which makes one regard them thenceforward as the variable instruments of a pleasure that is always the same. Indeed, that pleasure does not exist, isolated and formulated in the consciousness, as the ultimate object with which one seeks a woman\\\\'s company, or as the cause of the uneasiness which, in anticipation, one then feels. Hardly even does one think of oneself, but only how to escape from oneself. Obscurely awaited, immanent and concealed, it rouses to such a paroxysm, at the moment when at last it makes itself felt, those other pleasures which we find in the tender glance, in the kiss of her who is by our side, that it seems to us, more than anything else, a sort of transport of gratitude for the kindness of heart of our companion and for her touching predilection of ourselves, which we measure by the benefits, by the happiness that she showers upon us.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Alas, it was in vain that I implored the dungeon-keep of Roussainville, that I begged it to send out to meet me some daughter of its village, appealing to it as to the sole confidant to whom I had disclosed my earliest desire when, from the top floor of our house at Combray, from the little room that smelt of orris-root, I had peered out and seen nothing but its tower, framed in the square of the half-opened window, while, with the heroic scruples of a traveller setting forth for unknown climes, or of a desperate wretch hesitating on the verge of self-destruction, faint with emotion, I explored, across the bounds of my own experience, an untrodden path which, I believed, might lead me to my death, even\\u2014until passion spent itself and left me shuddering among the sprays of flowering currant which, creeping in through the window, tumbled all about my body. In vain I called upon it now. In vain I compressed the whole landscape into my field of vision, draining it with an exhaustive gaze which sought to extract from it a female creature. I might go alone as far as the porch of Saint-Andr\\u00e9-des-Champs: never did I find there the girl whom I should inevitably have met, had I been with my grandfather, and so unable to engage her in conversation. I would fix my eyes, without limit of time, upon the trunk of a distant tree, from behind which she must appear and spring towards me; my closest scrutiny left the horizon barren as before; night was falling; without any hope now would I concentrate my attention, as though to force up out of it the creatures which it must conceal, upon that sterile soil, that stale and outworn land; and it was no longer in lightness of heart, but with sullen anger that I aimed blows at the trees of Roussainville wood, from among which no more living creatures made their appearance than if they had been trees painted on the stretched canvas background of a panorama, when, unable to resign myself to having to return home without having held in my arms the woman I so greatly desired, I was yet obliged to retrace my steps towards Combray, and to admit to myself that the chance of her appearing in my path grew smaller every moment. And if she had appeared, would I have dared to speak to her? I felt that she would have regarded me as mad, for I no longer thought of those desires which came to me on my walks, but were never realized, as being shared by others, or as having any existence apart from myself. They seemed nothing more now than the purely subjective, impotent, illusory creatures of my temperament. They were in no way connected now with nature, with the world of real things, which from now onwards lost all its charm and significance, and meant no more to my life than a purely conventional framework, just as the action of a novel is framed in the railway carriage, on a seat of which a traveller is reading it to pass the time.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And it is perhaps from another impression which I received at Mont-jouvain, some years later, an impression which at that time was without meaning, that there arose, long afterwards, my idea of that cruel side of human passion called \\\\'sadism.\\\\' We shall see, in due course, that for quite another reason the memory of this impression was to play an important part in my life. It was during a spell of very hot weather; my parents, who had been obliged to go away for the whole day, had told me that I might stay out as late as I pleased; and having gone as far as the Montjouvain pond, where I enjoyed seeing again the reflection of the tiled roof of the hut, I had lain down in the shade and gone to sleep among the bushes on the steep slope that rose up behind the house, just where I had waited for my parents, years before, one day when they had gone to call on M. Vinteuil. It was almost dark when I awoke, and I wished to rise and go away, but I saw Mile. Vinteuil or thought, at least, that I recognised her, for I had not seen her often at Combray, and then only when she was still a child, whereas she was now growing into a young woman, who probably had just come in, standing in front of me, and only a few feet away from me, in that room in which her father had entertained mine, and which she had now made into a little sitting-room for herself. The window was partly open; the lamp was lighted; I could watch her every movement without her being able to see me; but, had I gone away, I must have made a rustling sound among the bushes, she would have heard me, and might have thought that I had been hiding there in order to spy upon her.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0She was in deep mourning, for her father had but lately died. We had not gone to see her; my mother had not cared to go, on account of that virtue which alone in her fixed any bounds to her benevolence\\u2014namely, modesty; but she pitied the girl from the depths of her heart. My mother had not forgotten the sad end of M. Vinteuil\\\\'s life, his complete absorption, first in having to play both mother and nursery-maid to his daughter, and, later, in the suffering which she had caused him; she could see the tortured expression which was never absent from the old man\\\\'s face in those terrible last years; she knew that he had definitely abandoned the task of transcribing in fair copies the whole of his later work, the poor little pieces, we imagined, of an old music-master, a retired village organist, which, we assumed, were of little or no value in themselves, though we did not despise them, because they were of such great value to him and had been the chief motive of his life before he sacrificed them to his daughter; pieces which, being mostly not even written down, but recorded only in his memory, while the rest were scribbled on loose sheets of paper, and quite illegible, must now remain unknown for ever; my mother thought, also, of that other and still more cruel renunciation to which M. Vinteuil had been driven, that of seeing the girl happily settled, with an honest and respectable future; when she called to mind all this utter and crushing misery that had come upon my aunts\\\\' old music-master, she was moved to very real grief, and shuddered to think of that other grief, so different in its bitterness, which Mlle. Vinteuil must now be feeling, tinged with remorse at having virtually killed her father. \\\"Poor M. Vinteuil,\\\" my mother would say, \\\"he lived for his daughter, and now he has died for her, without getting his reward. Will he get it now, I wonder, and in what form? It can only come to him from her.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0At the far end of Mlle. Vinteuil\\\\'s sitting-room, on the mantelpiece, stood a small photograph of her father which she went briskly to fetch, just as the sound of carriage wheels was heard from the road outside, then flung herself down on a sofa and drew close beside her a little table on which she placed the photograph, just as, long ago, M. Vinteuil had \\\\'placed\\\\' beside him the piece of music which he would have liked to play over to my parents. And then her friend came in. Mlle. Vinteuil greeted her without rising, clasping her hands behind her head, and drew her body to one side of the sofa, as though to \\\\'make room.\\\\' But no sooner had she done this than she appeared to feel that she was perhaps suggesting a particular position to her friend, with an emphasis which might well be regarded as importunate. She thought that her friend would prefer, no doubt, to sit down at some distance from her, upon a chair; she felt that she had been indiscreet; her sensitive heart took fright; stretching herself out again over the whole of the sofa, she closed her eyes and began to yawn, so as to indicate that it was a desire to sleep, and that alone, which had made her lie down there. Despite the rude and hectoring familiarity with which she treated her companion I could recognise in her the obsequious and reticent advances, the abrupt scruples and restraints which had characterised her father. Presently she rose and came to the window, where she pretended to be trying to close the shutters and not succeeding.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Leave them open,\\\" said her friend. \\\"I am hot.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"But it\\\\'s too dreadful! People will see us,\\\" Mlle. Vinteuil answered. And then she guessed, probably, that her friend would think that she had uttered these words simply in order to provoke a reply in certain other words, which she seemed, indeed, to wish to hear spoken, but, from prudence, would let her friend be the first to speak. And so, although I could not see her face clearly enough, I am sure that the expression must have appeared on it which my grandmother had once found so delightful, when she hastily went on: \\\"When I say \\\\'see us\\\\' I mean, of course, see us reading. It\\\\'s so dreadful to think that in every trivial little thing you do some one may be overlooking you.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0With the instinctive generosity of her nature, a courtesy beyond her control, she refrained from uttering the studied words which, she had felt, were indispensable for the full realisation of her desire. And perpetually, in the depths of her being, a shy and suppliant maiden would kneel before that other element, the old campaigner, battered but triumphant, would intercede with him and oblige him to retire.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Oh, yes, it is so extremely likely that people are looking at us at this time of night in this densely populated district!\\\" said her friend, with bitter irony. \\\"And what if they are?\\\" she went on, feeling bound to annotate with a malicious yet affectionate wink these words which she was repeating, out of good nature, like a lesson prepared beforehand which, she knew, it would please Mlle. Vinteuil to hear. \\\"And what if they are? All the better that they should see us.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Mlle. Vinteuil shuddered and rose to her feet. In her sensitive and scrupulous heart she was ignorant what words ought to flow, spontaneously, from her lips, so as to produce the scene for which her eager senses clamoured. She reached out as far as she could across the limitations of her true character to find the language appropriate to a vicious young woman such as she longed to be thought, but the words which, she imagined, such a young woman might have uttered with sincerity sounded unreal in her own mouth. And what little she allowed herself to say was said in a strained tone, in which her ingrained timidity paralysed her tendency to freedom and audacity of speech; while she kept on interrupting herself with: \\\"You\\\\'re sure you aren\\\\'t cold? You aren\\\\'t too hot? You don\\\\'t want to sit and read by yourself?...  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Your ladyship\\\\'s thoughts seem to be rather \\\\'warm\\\\' this evening,\\\" she concluded, doubtless repeating a phrase which she had heard used, on some earlier occasion, by her friend.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0In the V-shaped opening of her crape bodice Mlle. Vinteuil felt the sting of her friend\\\\'s sudden kiss; she gave a little scream and ran away; and then they began to chase one another about the room, scrambling over the furniture, their wide sleeves fluttering like wings, clucking and crowing like a pair of amorous fowls. At last Mlle. Vinteuil fell down exhausted upon the sofa, where she was screened from me by the stooping body of her friend. But the latter now had her back turned to the little table on which the old music-master\\\\'s portrait had been arranged. Mlle. Vinteuil realised that her friend would not see it unless her attention were drawn to it, and so exclaimed, as if she herself had just noticed it for the first time: \\\"Oh! there\\\\'s my father\\\\'s picture looking at us; I can\\\\'t think who can have put it there; I\\\\'m sure I\\\\'ve told them twenty times, that is not the proper place for it.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0I remembered the words that M. Vinteuil had used to my parents in apologising for an obtrusive sheet of music. This photograph was, of course, in common use in their ritual observances, was subjected to daily profanation, for the friend replied in words which were evidently a liturgical response: \\\"Let him stay there. He can\\\\'t trouble us any longer. D\\\\'you think he\\\\'d start whining, d\\\\'you think he\\\\'d pack you out of the house if he could see you now, with the window open, the ugly old monkey?\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0To which Mlle. Vinteuil replied, \\\"Oh, please!\\\"\\u2014a gentle reproach which testified to the genuine goodness of her nature, not that it was prompted by any resentment at hearing her father spoken of in this fashion for that was evidently a feeling which she had trained herself, by a long course of sophistries, to keep in close subjection at such moments, but rather because it was the bridle which, so as to avoid all appearance of egotism, she herself used to curb the gratification which her friend was attempting to procure for her. It may well have been, too, that the smiling moderation with which she faced and answered these blasphemies, that this tender and hypocritical rebuke appeared to her frank and generous nature as a particularly shameful and seductive form of that criminal attitude towards life which she was endeavouring to adopt. But she could not resist the attraction of being treated with affection by a woman who had just shewn herself so implacable towards the defenceless dead; she sprang on to the knees of her friend and held out a chaste brow to be kissed; precisely as a daughter would have done to her mother, feeling with exquisite joy that they would thus, between them, inflict the last turn of the screw of cruelty, in robbing M. Vinteuil, as though they were actually rifling his tomb, of the sacred rights of fatherhood. Her friend took the girl\\\\'s head in her hands and placed a kiss on her brow with a docility prompted by the real affection she had for Mlle. Vinteuil, as well as by the desire to bring what distraction she could into the dull and melancholy life of an orphan.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Do you know what I should like to do to that old horror?\\\" she said, taking up the photograph. She murmured in Mlle. Vinteuil\\\\'s ear something that I could not distinguish.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Oh! You would never dare.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\"Not dare to spit on it? On that?\\\" shouted the friend with deliberate brutality.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0I heard no more, for Mlle. Vinteuil, who now seemed weary, awkward, preoccupied, sincere, and rather sad, came back to the window and drew the shutters close; but I knew now what was the reward that M. Vinteuil, in return for all the suffering that he had endured in his lifetime, on account of his daughter, had received from her after his death.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And yet I have since reflected that if M. Vinteuil had been able to be present at this scene, he might still, and in spite of everything, have continued to believe in his daughter\\\\'s soundness of heart, and that he might even, in so doing, have been not altogether wrong. It was true that in all Mlle. Vinteuil\\\\'s actions the appearance of evil was so strong and so consistent that it would have been hard to find it exhibited in such completeness save in what is nowadays called a \\\\'sadist\\\\'; it is behind the footlights of a Paris theatre, and not under the homely lamp of an actual country house, that one expects to see a girl leading her friend on to spit upon the portrait of a father who has lived and died for nothing and no one but herself; and when we find in real life a desire for melodramatic effect, it is generally the \\\\'sadic\\\\' instinct that is responsible for it. It is possible that, without being in the least inclined towards \\\\'sadism,\\\\' a girl might have shewn the same outrageous cruelty as Mlle. Vinteuil in desecrating the memory and defying the wishes of her dead father, but she would not have given them deliberate expression in an act so crude in its symbolism, so lacking in subtlety; the criminal element in her behaviour would have been less evident to other people, and even to herself, since she would not have admitted to herself that she was doing wrong. But, appearances apart, in Mlle. Vinteuil\\\\'s soul, at least in the earlier stages, the evil element was probably not unmixed. A \\\\'sadist\\\\' of her kind is an artist in evil, which a wholly wicked person could not be, for in that case the evil would not have been external, it would have seemed quite natural to her, and would not even have been distinguishable from herself; and as for virtue, respect for the dead, filial obedience, since she would never have practised the cult of these things, she would take no impious delight in their profanation. \\\\'Sadists\\\\' of Mlle. Vinteuil\\\\'s sort are creatures so purely sentimental, so virtuous by nature, that even sensual pleasure appears to them as something bad, a privilege reserved for the wicked. And when they allow themselves for a moment to enjoy it they endeavour to impersonate, to assume all the outward appearance of wicked people, for themselves and their partners in guilt, so as to gain the momentary illusion of having escaped beyond the control of their own gentle and scrupulous natures into the inhuman world of pleasure. And I could understand how she must have longed for such an escape when I realised that it was impossible for her to effect it. At the moment when she wished to be thought the very antithesis of her father, what she at once suggested to me were the mannerisms, in thought and speech, of the poor old music-master. Indeed, his photograph was nothing; what she really desecrated, what she corrupted into ministering to her pleasures, but what remained between them and her and prevented her from any direct enjoyment of them, was the likeness between her face and his, his mother\\\\'s blue eyes which he had handed down to her, like some trinket to be kept in the family, those little friendly movements and inclinations which set up between the viciousness of Mlle. Vinteuil and herself a phraseology, a mentality not designed for vice, which made her regard it as not in any way different from the numberless little social duties and courtesies to which she must devote herself every day. It was not evil that gave her the idea of pleasure, that seemed to her attractive; it was pleasure, rather, that seemed evil. And as, every time that she indulged in it, pleasure came to her attended by evil thoughts such as, ordinarily, had no place in her virtuous mind, she came at length to see in pleasure itself something diabolical, to identify it with Evil. Perhaps Mlle. Vinteuil felt that at heart her friend was not altogether bad, not really sincere when she gave vent to those blasphemous utterances. At any rate, she had the pleasure of receiving those kisses on her brow, those smiles, those glances; all feigned, perhaps, but akin in their base and vicious mode of expression to those which would have been discernible on the face of a creature formed not out of kindness and long-suffering, but out of self-indulgence and cruelty. She was able to delude herself for a moment into believing that she was indeed amusing herself in the way in which, with so unnatural an accomplice, a girl might amuse herself who really did experience that savage antipathy towards her father\\\\'s memory. Perhaps she would not have thought of wickedness as a state so rare, so abnormal, so exotic, one which it was so refreshing to visit, had she been able to distinguish in herself, as in all her fellow-men and women, that indifference to the sufferings which they cause which, whatever names else be given it, is the one true, terrible and lasting form of cruelty. \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0_______________________________________  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0If the \\\\'M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise way\\\\' was so easy, it was a very different matter when we took the \\\\'Guermantes way,\\\\' for that meant a long walk, and we must make sure, first, of the weather. When we seemed to have entered upon a spell of fine days, when Fran\\u00e7oise, in desperation that not a drop was falling upon the \\\\'poor crops,\\\\' gazing up at the sky and seeing there only a little white cloud floating here and there upon its calm, azure surface, groaned aloud and exclaimed: \\\"You would say they were nothing more nor less than a lot of dogfish swimming about and sticking up their snouts! Ah, they never think of making it rain a little for the poor labourers! And then when the corn is all ripe, down it will come, rattling all over the place, and think no more of where it is falling than if it was on the sea!\\\"\\u2014when my father\\\\'s appeals to the gardener had met with the same encouraging answer several times in succession, then some one would say, at dinner: \\\"To-morrow, if the weather holds, we might go the Guermantes way.\\\" And off we would set, immediately after luncheon, through the little garden gate which dropped us into the Rue des Perchamps, narrow and bent at a sharp angle, dotted with grass-plots over which two or three wasps would spend the day botanising, a street as quaint as its name, from which its odd characteristics and its personality were, I felt, derived; a street for which one might search in vain through the Combray of to-day, for the public school now rises upon its site. But in my dreams of Combray like those architects, pupils of Viollet-le-Duc, who, fancying that they can detect, beneath a Renaissance rood-loft and an eighteenth-century altar, traces of a Norman choir, restore the whole church to the state in which it probably was in the twelfth century I leave not a stone of the modern edifice standing, I pierce through it and \\\\'restore\\\\' the Rue des Perchamps. And for such reconstruction memory furnishes me with more detailed guidance than is generally at the disposal of restorers; the pictures which it has preserved\\u2014perhaps the last surviving in the world to-day, and soon to follow the rest into oblivion\\u2014of what Combray looked like in my childhood\\\\'s days; pictures which, simply because it was the old Combray that traced their outlines upon my mind before it vanished, are as moving\\u2014if I may compare a humble landscape with those glorious works, reproductions of which my grandmother was so fond of bestowing on me\\u2014as those old engravings of the \\\\'Cenacolo,\\\\' or that painting by Gentile Bellini, in which one sees, in a state in which they no longer exist, the masterpiece of Leonardo and the portico of Saint Mark\\\\'s.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0We would pass, in the Rue de l\\\\'Oiseau, before the old hostelry of the Oiseau Flesch\\u00e9, into whose great courtyard, once upon a time, would rumble the coaches of the Duchesses de Montpensier, de Guermantes, and de Montmorency, when they had to come down to Combray for some litigation with their farmers, or to receive homage from them. We would come at length to the Mall, among whose treetops I could distinguish the steeple of Saint-Hilaire. And I should have liked to be able to sit down and spend the whole day there, reading and listening to the bells, for it was so charming there and so quiet that, when an hour struck, you would have said not that it broke in upon the calm of the day, but that it relieved the day of its superfluity, and that the steeple, with the indolent, painstaking exactitude of a person who has nothing else to do, had simply, in order to squeeze out and let fall the few golden drops which had slowly and naturally accumulated in the hot sunlight, pressed, at a given moment, the distended surface of the silence.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The great charm of the \\\\'Guermantes\\\\' way was that we had beside us, almost all the time, the course of the Vivonne. We crossed it first, ten minutes after leaving the house, by a foot-bridge called the Pont-Vieux. And every year, when we arrived at Combray, on Easter morning, after the sermon, if the weather was fine, I would run there to see amid all the disorder that prevails on the morning of a great festival, the gorgeous preparations for which make the everyday household utensils that they have not contrived to banish seem more sordid than ever the river flowing past, sky-blue already between banks still black and bare, its only companions a clump of daffodils, come out before their time, a few primroses, the first in flower, while here and there burned the blue flame of a violet, its stem bent beneath the weight of the drop of perfume stored in its tiny horn. The Pont-Vieux led to a tow-path which, at this point, would be overhung in summer by the bluish foliage of a hazel, under which a fisherman in a straw hat seemed to have taken root. At Combray, where I knew everyone, and could always detect the blacksmith or grocer\\\\'s boy through his disguise of a beadle\\\\'s uniform or chorister\\\\'s surplice, this fisherman was the only person whom I was never able to identify. He must have known my family, for he used to raise his hat when we passed; and then I would always be just on the point of asking his name, when some one would make a sign to me to be quiet, or I would frighten the fish. We would follow the tow-path which ran along the top of a steep bank, several feet above the stream. The ground on the other side was lower, and stretched in a series of broad meadows as far as the village and even to the distant railway-station. Over these were strewn the remains, half-buried in the long grass, of the castle of the old Counts of Combray, who, during the Middle Ages, had had on this side the course of the Vivonne as a barrier and defence against attack from the Lords of Guermantes and Abbots of Martinville. Nothing was left now but a few stumps of towers, hummocks upon the broad surface of the fields, hardly visible, broken battlements over which, in their day, the bowmen had hurled down stones, the watchmen had gazed out over Novepont, Clairefontaine, Martinville-le-Sec, Bailleau-l\\\\'Exempt, fiefs all of them of Guermantes, a ring in which Combray was locked; but fallen among the grass now, levelled with the ground, climbed and commanded by boys from the Christian Brothers\\\\' school, who came there in their playtime, or with lesson-books to be conned; emblems of a past that had sunk down and well-nigh vanished under the earth, that lay by the water\\\\'s edge now, like an idler taking the air, yet giving me strong food for thought, making the name of Combray connote to me not the little town of to-day only, but an historic city vastly different, seizing and holding my imagination by the remote, incomprehensible features which it half-concealed beneath a spangled veil of buttercups. For the buttercups grew past numbering on this spot which they had chosen for their games among the grass, standing singly, in couples, in whole companies, yellow as the yolk of eggs, and glowing with an added lustre, I felt, because, being powerless to consummate with my palate the pleasure which the sight of them never failed to give me, I would let it accumulate as my eyes ranged over their gilded expanse, until it had acquired the strength to create in my mind a fresh example of absolute, unproductive beauty; and so it had been from my earliest childhood, when from the tow-path I had stretched out my arms towards them, before even I could pronounce their charming name\\u2014a name fit for the Prince in some French fairy-tale; colonists, perhaps, in some far distant century from Asia, but naturalised now for ever in the village, well satisfied with their modest horizon, rejoicing in the sunshine and the water\\\\'s edge, faithful to their little glimpse of the railway-station; yet keeping, none the less, as do some of our old paintings, in their plebeian simplicity, a poetic scintillation from the golden East.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0I would amuse myself by watching the glass jars which the boys used to lower into the Vivonne, to catch minnows, and which, filled by the current of the stream, in which they themselves also were enclosed, at once \\\\'containers\\\\' whose transparent sides were like solidified water and \\\\'contents\\\\' plunged into a still larger container of liquid, flowing crystal, suggested an image of coolness more delicious and more provoking than the same water in the same jars would have done, standing upon a table laid for dinner, by shewing it as perpetually in flight between the impalpable water, in which my hands could not arrest it, and the insoluble glass, in which my palate could not enjoy it. I decided that I would come there again with a line and catch fish; I begged for and obtained a morsel of bread from our luncheon basket; and threw into the Vivonne pellets which had the power, it seemed, to bring about a chemical precipitation, for the water at once grew solid round about them in oval clusters of emaciated tadpoles, which until then it had, no doubt, been holding in solution, invisible, but ready and alert to enter the stage of crystallisation.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Presently the course of the Vivonne became choked with water-plants. At first they appeared singly, a lily, for instance, which the current, across whose path it had unfortunately grown, would never leave at rest for a moment, so that, like a ferry-boat mechanically propelled, it would drift over to one bank only to return to the other, eternally repeating its double journey. Thrust towards the bank, its stalk would be straightened out, lengthened, strained almost to breaking-point until the current again caught it, its green moorings swung back over their anchorage and brought the unhappy plant to what might fitly be called its starting-point, since it was fated not to rest there a moment before moving off once again. I would still find it there, on one walk after another, always in the same helpless state, suggesting certain victims of neurasthenia, among whom my grandfather would have included my aunt L\\u00e9onie, who present without modification, year after year, the spectacle of their odd and unaccountable habits, which they always imagine themselves to be on the point of shaking off, but which they always retain to the end; caught in the treadmill of their own maladies and eccentricities, their futile endeavours to escape serve only to actuate its mechanism, to keep in motion the clockwork of their strange, ineluctable, fatal daily round. Such as these was the water-lily, and also like one of those wretches whose peculiar torments, repeated indefinitely throughout eternity, aroused the curiosity of Dante, who would have inquired of them at greater length and in fuller detail from the victims themselves, had not Virgil, striding on ahead, obliged him to hasten after him at full speed, as I must hasten after my parents.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0But farther on the current slackened, where the stream ran through a property thrown open to the public by its owner, who had made a hobby of aquatic gardening, so that the little ponds into which the Vivonne was here diverted were aflower with water-lilies. As the banks at this point were thickly wooded, the heavy shade of the trees gave the water a background which was ordinarily dark green, although sometimes, when we were coming home on a calm evening after a stormy afternoon, I have seen in its depths a clear, crude blue that was almost violet, suggesting a floor of Japanese cloisonn\\u00e9. Here and there, on the surface, floated, blushing like a strawberry, the scarlet heart of a lily set in a ring of white petals.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Beyond these the flowers were more frequent, but paler, less glossy, more thickly seeded, more tightly folded, and disposed, by accident, in festoons so graceful that I would fancy I saw floating upon the stream, as though after the dreary stripping of the decorations used in some Watteau festival, moss-roses in loosened garlands. Elsewhere a corner seemed to be reserved for the commoner kinds of lily; of a neat pink or white like rocket-flowers, washed clean like porcelain, with housewifely care; while, a little farther again, were others, pressed close together in a floating garden-bed, as though pansies had flown out of a garden like butterflies and were hovering with blue and burnished wings over the transparent shadowiness of this watery border; this skiey border also, for it set beneath the flowers a soil of a colour more precious, more moving than their own; and both in the afternoon, when it sparkled beneath the lilies in the kaleidoscope of a happiness silent, restless, and alert, and towards evening, when it was filled like a distant heaven with the roseate dreams of the setting sun, incessantly changing and ever remaining in harmony, about the more permanent colour of the flowers themselves, with the utmost profundity, evanescence, and mystery\\u2014with a quiet suggestion of infinity; afternoon or evening, it seemed to have set them flowering in the heart of the sky.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0After leaving this park the Vivonne began to flow again more swiftly. How often have I watched, and longed to imitate, when I should be free to live as I chose, a rower who had shipped his oars and lay stretched out on his back, his head down, in the bottom of his boat, letting it drift with the current, seeing nothing but the sky which slipped quietly above him, shewing upon his features a foretaste of happiness and peace  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0We would sit down among the irises at the water\\\\'s edge. In the holiday sky a lazy cloud streamed out to its full length. Now and then, crushed by the burden of idleness, a carp would heave up out of the water, with an anxious gasp. It was time for us to feed. Before starting homewards we would sit for a long time there, eating fruit and bread and chocolate, on the grass, over which came to our ears, horizontal, faint, but solid still and metallic, the sound of the bells of Saint-Hilaire, which had melted not at all in the atmosphere it was so well accustomed to traverse, but, broken piecemeal by the successive palpitation of all their sonorous strokes, throbbed as it brushed the flowers at our feet.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Sometimes, at the water\\\\'s edge and embedded in trees, we would come upon a house of the kind called \\\\'pleasure houses,\\\\' isolated and lost, seeing nothing of the world, save the river which bathed its feet. A young woman, whose pensive face and fashionable veils did not suggest a local origin, and who had doubtless come there, in the popular phrase, \\\\'to bury herself,\\\\' to taste the bitter sweetness of feeling that her name, and still more the name of him whose heart she had once held, but had been unable to keep, were unknown there, stood framed in a window from which she had no outlook beyond the boat that was moored beside her door. She raised her eyes with an air of distraction when she heard, through the trees that lined the bank, the voices of passers-by of whom, before they came in sight, she might be certain that never had they known, nor would they know, the faithless lover, that nothing in their past lives bore his imprint, which nothing in their future would have occasion to receive. One felt that in her renunciation of life she had willingly abandoned those places in which she would at least have been able to see him whom she loved, for others where he had never trod. And I watched her, as she returned from some walk along a road where she had known that he would not appear, drawing from her submissive fingers long gloves of a precious, useless charm.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Never, in the course of our walks along the \\\\'Guermantes way,\\\\' might we penetrate as far as the source of the Vivonne, of which I had often thought, which had in my mind so abstract, so ideal an existence, that I had been as much surprised when some one told me that it was actually to be found in the same department, and at a given number of miles from Combray, as I had been on the day when I had learned that there was another fixed point somewhere on the earth\\\\'s surface, where, according to the ancients, opened the jaws of Hell. Nor could we ever reach that other goal, to which I longed so much to attain, Guermantes itself. I knew that it was the residence of its proprietors, the Duc and Duchesse de Guermantes, I knew that they were real personages who did actually exist, but whenever I thought about them I pictured them to myself either in tapestry, as was the \\\\'Coronation of Esther\\\\' which hung in our church, or else in changing, rainbow colours, as was Gilbert the Bad in his window, where he passed from cabbage green, when I was dipping my fingers in the holy water stoup, to plum blue when I had reached our row of chairs, or again altogether impalpable, like the image of Genevi\\u00e8ve de Brabant, ancestress of the Guermantes family, which the magic lantern sent wandering over the curtains of my room or flung aloft upon the ceiling\\u2014in short, always wrapped in the mystery of the Merovingian age, and bathed, as in a sunset, in the orange light which glowed from the resounding syllable \\\\'antes.\\\\' And if, in spite of that, they were for me, in their capacity as a duke and a duchess, real people, though of an unfamiliar kind, this ducal personality was in its turn enormously distended, immaterialised, so as to encircle and contain that Guermantes of which they were duke and duchess, all that sunlit \\\\'Guermantes way\\\\' of our walks, the course of the Vivonne, its water-lilies and its overshadowing trees, and an endless series of hot summer afternoons. And I knew that they bore not only the titles of Duc and Duchesse de Guermantes, but that since the fourteenth century, when, after vain attempts to conquer its earlier lords in battle, they had allied themselves by marriage, and so became Counts of Combray, the first citizens, consequently, of the place, and yet the only ones among its citizens who did not reside in it\\u2014Comtes de Combray, possessing Combray, threading it on their string of names and titles, absorbing it in their personalities, and illustrating, no doubt, in themselves that strange and pious melancholy which was peculiar to Combray; proprietors of the town, though not of any particular house there; dwelling, presumably, out of doors, in the street, between heaven and earth, like that Gilbert de Guermantes, of whom I could see, in the stained glass of the apse of Saint-Hilaire, only the \\\\'other side\\\\' in dull black lacquer, if I raised my eyes to look for him, when I was going to Camus\\\\'s for a packet of salt.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And then it happened that, going the \\\\'Guermantes way,\\\\' I passed occasionally by a row of well-watered little gardens, over whose hedges rose clusters of dark blossom. I would stop before them, hoping to gain some precious addition to my experience, for I seemed to have before my eyes a fragment of that riverside country which I had longed so much to see and know since coming upon a description of it by one of my favourite authors. And it was with that story-book land, with its imagined soil intersected by a hundred bubbling watercourses, that Guermantes, changing its form in my mind, became identified, after I heard Dr. Percepied speak of the flowers and the charming rivulets and fountains that were to be seen there in the ducal park. I used to dream that Mme. de Guermantes, taking a sudden capricious fancy for myself, invited me there, that all day long she stood fishing for trout by my side. And when evening came, holding my hand in her own, as we passed by the little gardens of her vassals, she would point out to me the flowers that leaned their red and purple spikes along the tops of the low walls, and would teach me all their names. She would make me tell her, too, all about the poems that I meant to compose. And these dreams reminded me that, since I wished, some day, to become a writer, it was high time to decide what sort of books I was going to write. But as soon as I asked myself the question, and tried to discover some subjects to which I could impart a philosophical significance of infinite value, my mind would stop like a clock, I would see before me vacuity, nothing, would feel either that I was wholly devoid of talent, or that, perhaps, a malady of the brain was hindering its development. Sometimes I would depend upon my father\\\\'s arranging everything for me. He was so powerful, in such favour with the people who \\\\'really counted,\\\\' that he made it possible for us to transgress laws which Fran\\u00e7oise had taught me to regard as more ineluctable than the laws of life and death, as when we were allowed to postpone for a year the compulsory repainting of the walls of our house, alone among all the houses in that part of Paris, or when he obtained permission from the Minister for Mme. Sazerat\\\\'s son, who had been ordered to some watering-place, to take his degree two months before the proper time, among the candidates whose surnames began with \\\\'A,\\\\' instead of having to wait his turn as an \\\\'S.\\\\' If I had fallen seriously ill, if I had been captured by brigands, convinced that my father\\\\'s understanding with the supreme powers was too complete, that his letters of introduction to the Almighty were too irresistible for my illness or captivity to turn out anything but vain illusions, in which there was no danger actually threatening me, I should have awaited with perfect composure the inevitable hour of my return to comfortable realities, of my deliverance from bondage or restoration to health. Perhaps this want of talent, this black cavity which gaped in my mind when I ransacked it for the theme of my future writings, was itself no more, either, than an unsubstantial illusion, and would be brought to an end by the intervention of my father, who would arrange with the Government and with Providence that I should be the first writer of my day. But at other times, while my parents were growing impatient at seeing me loiter behind instead of following them, my actual life, instead of seeming an artificial creation by my father, and one which he could modify as he chose, appeared, on the contrary, to be comprised in a larger reality which had not been created for my benefit, from whose judgments there was no appeal, in the heart of which I was bound, helpless, without friend or ally, and beyond which no further possibilities lay concealed. It was evident to me then that I existed in the same manner as all other men, that I must grow old, that I must die like them, and that among them I was to be distinguished merely as one of those who have no aptitude for writing. And so, utterly despondent, I renounced literature for ever, despite the encouragements that had been given me by Bloch. This intimate, spontaneous feeling, this sense of the nullity of my intellect, prevailed against all the flattering speeches that might be lavished upon me, as a wicked man, when everyone is loud in the praise of his good deeds, is gnawed by the secret remorse of conscience.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0One day my mother said: \\\"You are always talking about Mme. de Guermantes. Well, Dr. Percepied did a great deal for her when she was ill, four years ago, and so she is coming to Combray for his daughter\\\\'s wedding. You will be able to see her in church.\\\" It was from Dr. Percepied, as it happened, that I had heard most about Mme. de Guermantes, and he had even shewn us the number of an illustrated paper in which she was depicted in the costume which she had worn at a fancy dress ball given by the Princesse de L\\u00e9on.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Suddenly, during the nuptial mass, the beadle, by moving to one side, enabled me to see, sitting in a chapel, a lady with fair hair and a large nose, piercing blue eyes, a billowy scarf of mauve silk, glossy and new and brilliant, and a little spot at the corner of her nose. And because on the surface of her face, which was red, as though she had been very warm, I could make out, diluted and barely perceptible, details which resembled the portrait that had been shewn to me; because, more especially, the particular features which I remarked in this lady, if I attempted to catalogue them, formulated themselves in precisely the same terms:\\u2014a large nose, blue eyes, as Dr. Percepied had used when describing in my presence the Duchesse de Guermantes, I said to myself: \\\"This lady is like the Duchesse de Guermantes.\\\" Now the chapel from which she was following the service was that of Gilbert the Bad; beneath its flat tombstones, yellowed and bulging like cells of honey in a comb, rested the bones of the old Counts of Brabant; and I remembered having heard it said that this chapel was reserved for the Guermantes family, whenever any of its members came to attend a ceremony at Combray; there was, indeed, but one woman resembling the portrait of Mme. de Guermantes who on that day, the very day on which she was expected to come there, could be sitting in that chapel: it was she! My disappointment was immense. It arose from my not having borne in mind, when I thought of Mme. de Guermantes, that I was picturing her to myself in the colours of a tapestry or a painted window, as living in another century, as being of another substance than the rest of the human race. Never had I taken into account that she might have a red face, a mauve scarf like Mme. Sazerat; and the oval curve of her cheeks reminded me so strongly of people whom I had seen at home that the suspicion brushed against my mind though it was immediately banished that this lady in her creative principle, in the molecules of her physical composition, was perhaps not substantially the Duchesse de Guermantes, but that her body, in ignorance of the name that people had given it, belonged to a certain type of femininity which included, also, the wives of doctors and tradesmen. \\\"It is, it must be Mme. de Guermantes, and no one else!\\\" were the words underlying the attentive and astonished expression with which I was gazing upon this image, which, naturally enough, bore no resemblance to those that had so often, under the same title of \\\\'Mme. de Guermantes,\\\\' appeared to me in dreams, since this one had not been, like the others, formed arbitrarily by myself, but had sprung into sight for the first time, only a moment ago, here in church; an image which was not of the same nature, was not colourable at will, like those others that allowed themselves to imbibe the orange tint of a sonorous syllable, but which was so real that everything, even to the fiery little spot at the corner of her nose, gave an assurance of her subjection to the laws of life, as in a transformation scene on the stage a crease in the dress of a fairy, a quivering of her tiny finger, indicate the material presence of a living actress before our eyes, whereas we were uncertain, till then, whether we were not looking merely at a projection of limelight from a lantern.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Meanwhile I was endeavouring to apply to this image, which the prominent nose, the piercing eyes pinned down and fixed in my field of vision perhaps because it was they that had first struck it, that had made the first impression on its surface, before I had had time to wonder whether the woman who thus appeared before me might possibly be Mme. de Guermantes, to this fresh and unchanging image the idea: \\\"It is Mme. de Guermantes\\\"; but I succeeded only in making the idea pass between me and the image, as though they were two discs moving in separate planes, with a space between. But this Mme. de Guermantes of whom I had so often dreamed, now that I could see that she had a real existence independent of myself, acquired a fresh increase of power over my imagination, which, paralysed for a moment by contact with a reality so different from anything that it had expected, began to react and to say within me: \\\"Great and glorious before the days of Charlemagne, the Guermantes had the right of life and death over their vassals; the Duchesse de Guermantes descends from Genevi\\u00e8ve de Brabant. She does not know, nor would she consent to know, any of the people who are here to-day.\\\"  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And then\\u2014oh, marvellous independence of the human gaze, tied to the human face by a cord so loose, so long, so elastic that it can stray, alone, as far as it may choose\\u2014while Mme. de Guermantes sat in the chapel above the tombs of her dead ancestors, her gaze lingered here and wandered there, rose to the capitals of the pillars, and even rested upon myself, like a ray of sunlight straying down the nave, but a ray of sunlight which, at the moment when I received its caress, appeared conscious of where it fell. As for Mme. de Guermantes herself, since she remained there motionless, sitting like a mother who affects not to notice the rude or awkward conduct of her children who, in the course of their play, are speaking to people whom she does not know, it was impossible for me to determine whether she approved or condemned the vagrancy of her eyes in the careless detachment of her heart.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0I felt it to be important that she should not leave the church before I had been able to look long enough upon her, reminding myself that for years past I had regarded the sight of her as a thing eminently to be desired, and I kept my eyes fixed on her, as though by gazing at her I should be able to carry away and incorporate, to store up, for later reference, in myself the memory of that prominent nose, those red cheeks, of all those details which struck me as so much precious, authentic, unparalleled information with regard to her face. And now that, whenever I brought my mind to bear upon that face\\u2014and especially, perhaps, in my determination, that form of the instinct of self-preservation with which we guard everything that is best in ourselves, not to admit that I had been in any way deceived\\u2014I found only beauty there; setting her once again since they were one and the same person, this lady who sat before me and that Duchesse de Guermantes whom, until then, I had been used to conjure into an imagined shape apart from and above that common run of humanity with which the sight, pure and simple, of her in the flesh had made me for a moment confound her, I grew indignant when I heard people saying, in the congregation round me: \\\"She is better looking than Mme. Sazerat\\\" or \\\"than Mlle. Vinteuil,\\\" as though she had been in any way comparable with them. And my gaze resting upon her fair hair, her blue eyes, the lines of her neck, and overlooking the features which might have reminded me of the faces of other women, I cried out within myself, as I admired this deliberately unfinished sketch: \\\"How lovely she is! What true nobility! it is indeed a proud Guermantes, the descendant of Genevi\\u00e8ve de Brabant, that I have before me!\\\" And the care which I took to focus all my attention upon her face succeeded in isolating it so completely that to-day, when I call that marriage ceremony to mind, I find it impossible to visualise any single person who was present except her, and the beadle who answered me in the affirmative when I inquired whether the lady was, indeed, Mme. de Guermantes. But her, I can see her still quite clearly, especially at the moment when the procession filed into the sacristy, lighted by the intermittent, hot sunshine of a windy and rainy day, where Mme. de Guermantes found herself in the midst of all those Combray people whose names, even, she did not know, but whose inferiority proclaimed her own supremacy so loud that she must, in return, feel for them a genuine, pitying sympathy, and whom she might count on impressing even more forcibly by virtue of her simplicity and natural charm. And then, too, since she could not bring into play the deliberate glances, charged with a definite meaning, which one directs, in a crowd, towards people whom one knows, but must allow her vague thoughts to escape continually from her eyes in a flood of blue light which she was powerless to control, she was anxious not to distress in any way, not to seem to be despising those humbler mortals over whom that current flowed, by whom it was everywhere arrested. I can see again to-day, above her mauve scarf, silky and buoyant, the gentle astonishment in her eyes, to which she had added, without daring to address it to anyone in particular, but so that everyone might enjoy his share of it, the almost timid smile of a sovereign lady who seems to be making an apology for her presence among the vassals whom she loves. This smile rested upon myself, who had never ceased to follow her with my eyes. And I, remembering the glance which she had let fall upon me during the service, blue as a ray of sunlight that had penetrated the window of Gilbert the Bad, said to myself, \\\"Of course, she is thinking about me.\\\" I fancied that I had found favour in her sight, that she would continue to think of me after she had left the church, and would, perhaps, grow pensive again, that evening, at Guermantes, on my account. And at once I fell in love with her, for if it is sometimes enough to make us love a woman that she looks on us with contempt, as I supposed Mlle. Swann to have done, while we imagine that she cannot ever be ours, it is enough, also, sometimes that she looks on us kindly, as Mme. de Guermantes did then, while we think of her as almost ours already. Her eyes waxed blue as a periwinkle flower, wholly beyond my reach, yet dedicated by her to me; and the sun, bursting out again from behind a threatening cloud and darting the full force of its rays on to the Square and into the sacristy, shed a geranium glow over the red carpet laid down for the wedding, along which Mme. de Guermantes smilingly advanced, and covered its woollen texture with a nap of rosy velvet, a bloom of light, giving it that sort of tenderness, of solemn sweetness in the pomp of a joyful celebration, which characterises certain pages of Lohengrin, certain paintings by Carpaccio, and makes us understand how Baudelaire was able to apply to the sound of the trumpet the epithet \\\\'delicious.\\\\'  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0How often, after that day, in the course of my walks along the \\\\'Guermantes way,\\\\' and with what an intensified melancholy did I reflect on my lack of qualification for a literary career, and that I must abandon all hope of ever becoming a famous author. The regret that I felt for this, while I lingered alone to dream for a little by myself, made me suffer so acutely that, in order not to feel it, my mind of its own accord, by a sort of inhibition in the instant of pain, ceased entirely to think of verse-making, of fiction, of the poetic future on which my want of talent precluded me from counting. Then, quite apart from all those literary preoccupations, and without definite attachment to anything, suddenly a roof, a gleam of sunlight reflected from a stone, the smell of a road would make me stop still, to enjoy the special pleasure that each of them gave me, and also because they appeared to be concealing, beneath what my eyes could see, something which they invited me to approach and seize from them, but which, despite all my efforts, I never managed to discover. As I felt that the mysterious object was to be found in them, I would stand there in front of them, motionless, gazing, breathing, endeavouring to penetrate with my mind beyond the thing seen or smelt. And if I had then to hasten after my grandfather, to proceed on my way, I would still seek to recover my sense of them by closing my eyes; I would concentrate upon recalling exactly the line of the roof, the colour of the stone, which, without my being able to understand why, had seemed to me to be teeming, ready to open, to yield up to me the secret treasure of which they were themselves no more than the outer coverings. It was certainly not any impression of this kind that could or would restore the hope I had lost of succeeding one day in becoming an author and poet, for each of them was associated with some material object devoid of any intellectual value, and suggesting no abstract truth. But at least they gave me an unreasoning pleasure, the illusion of a sort of fecundity of mind; and in that way distracted me from the tedium, from the sense of my own impotence which I had felt whenever I had sought a philosophic theme for some great literary work. So urgent was the task imposed on my conscience by these impressions of form or perfume or colour\\u2014to strive for a perception of what lay hidden beneath them, that I was never long in seeking an excuse which would allow me to relax so strenuous an effort and to spare myself the fatigue that it involved. As good luck would have it, my parents called me; I felt that I had not, for the moment, the calm environment necessary for a successful pursuit of my researches, and that it would be better to think no more of the matter until I reached home, and not to exhaust myself in the meantime to no purpose. And so I concerned myself no longer with the mystery that lay hidden in a form or a perfume, quite at ease in my mind, since I was taking it home with me, protected by its visible and tangible covering, beneath which I should find it still alive, like the fish which, on days when I had been allowed to go out fishing, I used to carry back in my basket, buried in a couch of grass which kept them cool and fresh. Once in the house again I would begin to think of something else, and so my mind would become littered as my room was with the flowers that I had gathered on my walks, or the odds and ends that people had given me with a stone from the surface of which the sunlight was reflected, a roof, the sound of a bell, the smell of fallen leaves, a confused mass of different images, under which must have perished long ago the reality of which I used to have some foreboding, but which I never had the energy to discover and bring to light. Once, however, when we had prolonged our walk far beyond its ordinary limits, and so had been very glad to encounter, half way home, as afternoon darkened into evening, Dr. Percepied, who drove past us at full speed in his carriage, saw and recognised us, stopped, and made us jump in beside him, I received an impression of this sort which I did not abandon without having first subjected it to an examination a little more thorough. I had been set on the box beside the coachman, we were going like the wind because the Doctor had still, before returning to Combray, to call at Martinville-le-Sec, at the house of a patient, at whose door he asked us to wait for him. At a bend in the road I experienced, suddenly, that special pleasure, which bore no resemblance to any other, when I caught sight of the twin steeples of Martinville, on which the setting sun was playing, while the movement of the carriage and the windings of the road seemed to keep them continually changing their position; and then of a third steeple, that of Vieuxvicq, which, although separated from them by a hill and a valley, and rising from rather higher ground in the distance, appeared none the less to be standing by their side.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0In ascertaining and noting the shape of their spires, the changes of aspect, the sunny warmth of their surfaces, I felt that I was not penetrating to the full depth of my impression, that something more lay behind that mobility, that luminosity, something which they seemed at once to contain and to conceal.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0The steeples appeared so distant, and we ourselves seemed to come so little nearer them, that I was astonished when, a few minutes later, we drew up outside the church of Martinville. I did not know the reason for the pleasure which I had found in seeing them upon the horizon, and the business of trying to find out what that reason was seemed to me irksome; I wished only to keep in reserve in my brain those converging lines, moving in the sunshine, and, for the time being, to think of them no more. And it is probable that, had I done so, those two steeples would have vanished for ever, in a great medley of trees and roofs and scents and sounds which I had noticed and set apart on account of the obscure sense of pleasure which they gave me, but without ever exploring them more fully. I got down from the box to talk to my parents while we were waiting for the Doctor to reappear. Then it was time to start; I climbed up again to my place, turning my head to look back, once more, at my steeples, of which, a little later, I caught a farewell glimpse at a turn in the road. The coachman, who seemed little inclined for conversation, having barely acknowledged my remarks, I was obliged, in default of other society, to fall back on my own, and to attempt to recapture the vision of my steeples. And presently their outlines and their sunlit surface, as though they had been a sort of rind, were stripped apart; a little of what they had concealed from me became apparent; an idea came into my mind which had not existed for me a moment earlier, framed itself in words in my head; and the pleasure with which the first sight of them, just now, had filled me was so much enhanced that, overpowered by a sort of intoxication, I could no longer think of anything but them. At this point, although we had now travelled a long way from Martinville, I turned my head and caught sight of them again, quite black this time, for the sun had meanwhile set. Every few minutes a turn in the road would sweep them out of sight; then they shewed themselves for the last time, and so I saw them no more.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Without admitting to myself that what lay buried within the steeples of Martinville must be something analogous to a charming phrase, since it was in the form of words which gave me pleasure that it had appeared to me, I borrowed a pencil and some paper from the Doctor, and composed, in spite of the jolting of the carriage, to appease my conscience and to satisfy my enthusiasm, the following little fragment, which I have since discovered, and now reproduce, with only a slight revision here and there. \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0_______________________________________  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0Alone, rising from the level of the plain, and seemingly lost in that expanse of open country, climbed to the sky the twin steeples of Martinville. Presently we saw three: springing into position confronting them by a daring volt, a third, a dilatory steeple, that of Vieuxvicq, was come to join them. The minutes passed, we were moving rapidly, and yet the three steeples were always a long way ahead of us, like three birds perched upon the plain, motionless and conspicuous in the sunlight. Then the steeple of Vieuxvicq withdrew, took its proper distance, and the steeples of Martinville remained alone, gilded by the light of the setting sun, which, even at that distance, I could see playing and smiling upon their sloped sides. We had been so long in approaching them that I was thinking of the time that must still elapse before we could reach them when, of a sudden, the carriage, having turned a corner, set us down at their feet; and they had flung themselves so abruptly in our path that we had barely time to stop before being dashed against the porch of the church.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0We resumed our course; we had left Martinville some little time, and the village, after accompanying us for a few seconds, had already disappeared, when, lingering alone on the horizon to watch our flight, its steeples and that of Vieuxvicq waved once again, in token of farewell, their sun-bathed pinnacles. Sometimes one would withdraw, so that the other two might watch us for a moment still; then the road changed direction, they veered in the light like three golden pivots, and vanished from my gaze. But, a little later, when we were already close to Combray, the sun having set meanwhile, I caught sight of them for the last time, far away, and seeming no more now than three flowers painted upon the sky above the low line of fields. They made me think, too, of three maidens in a legend, abandoned in a solitary place over which night had begun to fall; and while we drew away from them at a gallop, I could see them timidly seeking their way, and, after some awkward, stumbling movements of their noble silhouettes, drawing close to one another, slipping one behind another, shewing nothing more, now, against the still rosy sky than a single dusky form, charming and resigned, and so vanishing in the night. \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0_______________________________________  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0I never thought again of this page, but at the moment when, on my corner of the box-seat, where the Doctor\\\\'s coachman was in the habit of placing, in a hamper, the fowls which he had bought at Martinville market, I had finished writing it, I found such a sense of happiness, felt that it had so entirely relieved my mind of the obsession of the steeples, and of the mystery which they concealed, that, as though I myself were a hen and had just laid an egg, I began to sing at the top of my voice.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0All day long, during these walks, I had been able to muse upon the pleasure that there would be in the friendship of the Duchesse de Guermantes, in fishing for trout, in drifting by myself in a boat on the Vivonne; and, greedy for happiness, I asked nothing more from life, in such moments, than that it should consist always of a series of joyous afternoons. But when, on our way home, I had caught sight of a farm, on the left of the road, at some distance from two other farms which were themselves close together, and from which, to return to Combray, we need only turn down an avenue of oaks, bordered on one side by a series of orchard-closes, each one planted at regular intervals with apple-trees which cast upon the ground, when they were lighted by the setting sun, the Japanese stencil of their shadows; then, sharply, my heart would begin to beat, I would know that in half an hour we should be at home, and that there, as was the rule on days when we had taken the \\\\'Guermantes way\\\\' and dinner was, in consequence, served later than usual, I should be sent to bed as soon as I had swallowed my soup, so that my mother, kept at table, just as though there had been company to dinner, would not come upstairs to say good night to me in bed. The zone of melancholy which I then entered was totally distinct from that other zone, in which I had been bounding for joy a moment earlier, just as sometimes in the sky a band of pink is separated, as though by a line invisibly ruled, from a band of green or black. You may see a bird flying across the pink; it draws near the border-line, touches it, enters and is lost upon the black. The longings by which I had just now been absorbed, to go to Guermantes, to travel, to live a life of happiness\\u2014I was now so remote from them that their fulfilment would have afforded me no pleasure. How readily would I have sacrificed them all, just to be able to cry, all night long, in the arms of Mamma! Shuddering with emotion, I could not take my agonised eyes from my mother\\\\'s face, which was not to appear that evening in the bedroom where I could see myself already lying, in imagination; and wished only that I were lying dead. And this state would persist until the morrow, when, the rays of morning leaning their bars of light, as the gardener might lean his ladder, against the wall overgrown with nasturtiums, which clambered up it as far as my window-sill, I would leap out of bed to run down at once into the garden, with no thought of the fact that evening must return, and with it the hour when I must leave my mother. And so it was from the \\\\'Guermantes way\\\\' that I learned to distinguish between these states which reigned alternately in my mind, during certain periods, going so far as to divide every day between them, each one returning to dispossess the other with the regularity of a fever and ague: contiguous, and yet so foreign to one another, so devoid of means of communication, that I could no longer understand, or even picture to myself, in one state what I had desired or dreaded or even done in the other.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0So the \\\\'M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise way\\\\' and the \\\\'Guermantes way\\\\' remain for me linked with many of the little incidents of that one of all the divers lives along whose parallel lines we are moved, which is the most abundant in sudden reverses of fortune, the richest in episodes; I mean the life of the mind. Doubtless it makes in us an imperceptible progress, and the truths which have changed for us its meaning and its aspect, which have opened new paths before our feet, we had for long been preparing for their discovery; but that preparation was unconscious; and for us those truths date only from the day, from the minute when they became apparent. The flowers which played then among the grass, the water which rippled past in the sunshine, the whole landscape which served as environment to their apparition lingers around the memory of them still with its unconscious or unheeding air; and, certainly, when they were slowly scrutinised by this humble passer-by, by this dreaming child\\u2014as the face of a king is scrutinised by a petitioner lost in the crowd\\u2014that scrap of nature, that corner of a garden could never suppose that it would be thanks to him that they would be elected to survive in all their most ephemeral details; and yet the scent of hawthorn which strays plundering along the hedge from which, in a little while, the dog-roses will have banished it, a sound of footsteps followed by no echo, upon a gravel path, a bubble formed at the side of a waterplant by the current, and formed only to burst\\u2014my exaltation of mind has borne them with it, and has succeeded in making them tra all these successive years, while all around them the one-trodden ways have vanished, while those who thronged those ways, and even the memory of those who thronged those trodden ways, are dead. Sometimes the fragment of landscape thus transported into the present will detach itself in such isolation from all associations that it floats uncertainly upon my mind, like a flowering isle of Delos, and I am unable to say from what place, from what time\\u2014perhaps, quite simply, from which of my dreams\\u2014it comes. But it is pre-eminently as the deepest layer of my mental soil, as firm sites on which I still may build, that I regard the M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise and Guermantes \\\\'ways.\\\\' It is because I used to think of certain things, of certain people, while I was roaming along them, that the things, the people which they taught me to know, and these alone, I still take seriously, still give me joy. Whether it be that the faith which creates has ceased to exist in me, or that reality will take shape in the memory alone, the flowers that people shew me nowadays for the first time never seem to me to be true flowers. The \\\\'M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise way\\\\' with its lilacs, its hawthorns, its cornflowers, its poppies, its apple-trees, the \\\\'Guermantes way\\\\' with its river full of tadpoles, its water-lilies, and its buttercups have constituted for me for all time the picture of the land in which I fain would pass my life, in which my only requirements are that I may go out fishing, drift idly in a boat, see the ruins of a gothic fortress in the grass, and find hidden among the cornfields\\u2014as Saint-Andr\\u00e9-des-Champs lay hidden\\u2014an old church, monumental, rustic, and yellow like a mill-stone; and the cornflowers, the hawthorns, the apple-trees which I may happen, when I go walking, to encounter in the fields, because they are situated at the same depth, on the level of my past life, at once establish contact with my heart. And yet, because there is an element of individuality in places, when I am seized with a desire to see again the \\\\'Guermantes way,\\\\' it would not be satisfied were I led to the banks of a river in which were lilies as fair, or even fairer than those in the Vivonne, any more than on my return home in the evening, at the hour when there awakened in me that anguish which, later on in life, transfers itself to the passion of love, and may even become its inseparable companion, I should have wished for any strange mother to come in and say good night to me, though she were far more beautiful and more intelligent than my own. No: just as the one thing necessary to send me to sleep contented in that untroubled peace which no mistress, in later years, has ever been able to give me, since one has doubts of them at the moment when one believes in them, and never can possess their hearts as I used to receive, in her kiss, the heart of my mother, complete, without scruple or reservation, unburdened by any liability save to myself was that it should be my mother who came, that she should incline towards me that face on which there was, beneath her eye, something that was, it appears, a blemish, and which I loved as much as all the rest\\u2014so what I want to see again is the \\\\'Guermantes way\\\\' as I knew it, with the farm that stood a little apart from the two neighbouring farms, pressed so close together, at the entrance to the oak avenue; those meadows upon whose surface, when it is polished by the sun to the mirroring radiance of a lake, are outlined the leaves of the apple-trees; that whole landscape whose individuality sometimes, at night, in my dreams, binds me with a power that is almost fantastic, of which I can discover no trace when I awake.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0No doubt, by virtue of having permanently and indissolubly combined in me groups of different impressions, for no reason save that they had made me feel several separate things at the same time, the M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise and Guermantes \\\\'ways\\\\' left me exposed, in later life, to much disillusionment, and even to many mistakes. For often I have wished to see a person again without realising that it was simply because that person recalled to me a hedge of hawthorns in blossom; and I have been led to believe, and to make some one else believe in an aftermath of affection, by what was no more than an inclination to travel. But by the same qualities, and by their persistence in those of my impressions, to-day, to which they can find an attachment, the two \\\\'ways\\\\' give to those impressions a foundation, depth, a dimension lacking from the rest. They invest them, too, with a charm, a significance which is for me alone. When, on a summer evening, the resounding sky growls like a tawny lion, and everyone is complaining of the storm, it is along the \\\\'M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise way\\\\' that my fancy strays alone in ecstasy, inhaling, through the noise of falling rain, the odour of invisible and persistent lilac-trees.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0And so I would often lie until morning, dreaming of the old days at Combray, of my melancholy and wakeful evenings there; of other days besides, the memory of which had been more lately restored to me by the taste\\u2014by what would have been called at Combray the \\\\'perfume\\\\'\\u2014-of a cup of tea; and, by an association of memories, of a story which, many years after I had left the little place, had been told me of a love affair in which Swann had been involved before I was born; with that accuracy of detail which it is easier, often, to obtain when we are studying the lives of people who have been dead for centuries than when we are trying to chronicle those of our own most intimate friends, an accuracy which it seems as impossible to attain as it seemed impossible to speak from one town to another, before we learned of the contrivance by which that impossibility has been overcome. All these memories, following one after another, were condensed into a single substance, but had not so far coalesced that I could not discern between the three strata, between my oldest, my instinctive memories, those others, inspired more recently by a taste or \\\\'perfume,\\\\' and those which were actually the memories of another, from whom I had acquired them at second hand\\u2014no fissures, indeed, no geological faults, but at least those veins, those streaks of colour which in certain rocks, in certain marbles, point to differences of origin, age, and formation.  \\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\\\xa0It is true that, when morning drew near, I would long have settled the brief uncertainty of my waking dream, I would know in what room I was actually lying, would have reconstructed it round about me in the darkness, and\\u2014fixing my orientation by memory alone, or with the assistance of a feeble glimmer of light at the foot of which I placed the curtains and the window\\u2014would have reconstructed it complete and with its furniture, as an architect and an upholsterer might do, working upon an original, discarded plan of the doors and windows; would have replaced the mirrors and set the chest-of-drawers on its accustomed site. \\\\'But scarcely had daylight itself\\u2014and no longer the gleam from a last, dying ember on a brass curtain-rod, which I had mistaken for daylight\\u2014traced across the darkness, as with a stroke of chalk across a blackboard, its first white correcting ray, when the window, with its curtains, would leave the frame of the doorway, in which I had erroneously placed it, while, to make room for it, the writing-table, which my memory had clumsily fixed where the window ought to be, would hurry off at full speed, thrusting before it the mantelpiece, and sweeping aside the wall of the passage; the well of the courtyard would be enthroned on the spot where, a moment earlier, my dressing-room had lain, and the dwelling-place which I had built up for myself in the darkness would have gone to join all those other dwellings of which I had caught glimpses from the whirlpool of awakening; put to flight by that pale sign traced above my window-curtains by the uplifted forefinger of day. \",\n          \" Hop on to a magic carpet ride I don't know if the wind could take us All the way downtown Hop on to a

Now, this attitude on my father\\u2019s part may be felt to require a few words of e planation, inasmuch as some of us, no doubt, remember a Cottard of distinct mediocrity and a Swann by whom modesty and discretion, in all his social relations, were carried to the utmost refinement of delicacy. But in his case, what had happened was that, to the original \\u2018young Swann\\u2019 and also to the Swann of the Jockey Club, our old friend had added a fresh personality which was not to be his last, that of Odette\\u2019s husband. Adapting to the humble ambitions of that lady the instinct, the desire, the industry which he had always had, he had laboriously constructed for himself, a long way beneath the old, a new position more appropriate to the companion who was to share it with him. In this he shewed himself another man. Since while he continued to go, by himself, to the houses of his own friends, on whom he did not care to inflict Odette unless they had e pressly asked that she should be  duced to them it was a new life that he had begun to lead, in common with his wife, among a new set of people, it was quite intelligible that, in order to estimate the importance of these new friends and thereby the pleasure, the self-esteem that were to be derived from entertaining them, he should have made use, as a standard of comparison, not of the brilliant society in which he himself had moved before his marriage but of the earlier environment of Odette. And yet, even when one knew that it was with unfashionable officials and their faded wives, the wallflowers of ministerial ball-rooms, that he was now an ious to associate, it was still astonishing to hear him, who in the old days, and even still, would so gracefully refrain from mentioning an invitation to Twickenham or to Marlborough House, proclaim with quite unnecessary emphasis that the wife of some Assistant Under-Secretary for Something had returned Mme. Swann\\u2019s call. It will perhaps be objected here that what this really implied was that the simplicity of the fashionable Swann had been nothing more than a supreme refinement of vanity, and that, like certain other Israelites, my parents\\u2019 old friend had contrived to illustrate in turn all the stages through which his race had passed, from the crudest and coarsest form of snobbishness up to the highest pitch of good manners. But the chief reason \\u2014 and one which is applicable to humanity as a whole \\u2014 was that our virtues themselves are not free and floating qualities over which we retain a permanent control and power of disposal; they come to be so closely linked in our minds with the actions in conjunction with which we make it our duty to practise them, that, if we are suddenly called upon to perform some action of a different order, it takes us by surprise, and without our supposing for a moment that it might involve the bringing of those very same virtues into play. Swann, in his intense consciousness of his new social surroundings, and in the pride with which he referred to them, was like those great artists \\u2014 modest or generous by nature \\u2014 who, if at the end of their career they take to cooking or to gardening, display a childlike gratification at the compliments that are paid to their dishes or their borders, and will not listen to any of the criticism which they heard unmoved when it was applied to their real achievements; or who, after giving away a canvas, cannot conceal their annoyance if they lose a couple of francs at dominoes  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 As for Professor Cottard, we shall meet him again and can study him at our leisure, much later in the course of our story, with the \\u2018Mistress,\\u2019 Mme. Verdurin, in her country house La Raspeli\\u00e8re. For the present, the following observations must suffice; first of all, in the case of Swann the alteration might indeed be surprising, since it had been accomplished and yet was not suspected by me when I used to see Gilberte\\u2019s father in the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es, where, moreover, as he never spoke to me, he could not very well have made any display of his political relations. It is true that, if he had done so, I might not at once have discerned his vanity, for the idea that one has long held of a person is apt to stop one\\u2019s eyes and ears; my mother, for three whole years, had no more noticed the salve with which one of her nieces used to paint her lips than if it had been wholly and invisibly dissolved in some clear liquid; until one day a streak too much, or possibly something else, brought about the phenomenon known as super-saturation; all the paint that had hitherto passed unperceived was now crystallised, and my mother, in the face of this sudden riot of colour, declared, in the best Combray manner, that it was a perfect scandal, and almost severed relations with her niece. With Cottard, on the contrary, the epoch in which we have seen him assisting at the first  duction of Swann to the Verdurins was now buried in the past; whereas honours, offices and titles come with the passage of years; moreover, a man may be illiterate, and make stupid puns, and yet have a special gift, which no amount of general culture can replace \\u2014 such as the gift of a great strategist or physician. And so it was not merely as an obscure practitioner, who had attained in course of time to European celebrity, that the rest of his profession regarded Cottard. The most intelligent of the younger doctors used to assert \\u2014 for a year or two, that is to say, for fashions, being themselves begotten of the desire for change, are quick to change also \\u2014 that if they themselves ever fell ill Cottard was the only one of the leading men to whom they would entrust their lives. No doubt they preferred, socially, to meet certain others who were better read, more artistic, with whom they could discuss Nietzsche and Wagner. When there was a musical party at Mme. Cottard\\u2019s, on the evenings when she entertained \\u2014 in the hope that it might one day make him Dean of the Faculty \\u2014 the colleagues and pupils of her husband, he, instead of listening, preferred to play cards in another room. Yet everybody praised the quickness, the penetration, the unerring confidence with which, at a glance, he could diagnose disease. Thirdly, in considering the general impression which Professor Cottard must have made on a man like my father, we must bear in mind that the character which a man e hibits in the latter half of his life is not always, even if it is often his original character developed or withered, attenuated or enlarged; it is sometimes the e act opposite, like a garment that has been turned. E cept from the Verdurins, who were infatuated with him, Cottard\\u2019s hesitating manner, his e cessive timidity and affability had, in his young days, called down upon him endless taunts and sneers. What charitable friend counselled that glacial air? The importance of his professional standing made it all the more easy to adopt. Wherever he went, save at the Verdurins\\u2019, where he instinctively became himself again, he would assume a repellent coldness, remain silent as long as possible, be peremptory when he was obliged to speak, and not forget to say the most cutting things. He had every opportunity of rehearsing this new attitude before his patients, who, seeing him for the first time, were not in a position to make comparisons, and would have been greatly surprised to learn that he was not at all a rude man by nature. Complete impassivity was what he strove to attain, and even while visiting his hospital wards, when he allowed himself to utter one of those puns which left everyone, from the house physician to the junior student, helpless with laughter, he would always make it without moving a muscle of his face, while even that was no longer recognisable now that he had shaved off his beard and moustache  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 But who, the reader has been asking, was the Marquis de Norpois? Well, he had been Minister Plenipotentiary before the War, and was actually an Ambassador on the Si teenth of May; in spite of which, and to the general astonishment, he had since been several times chosen to represent France on E traordinary Missions \\u2014 even as Controller of the Public Debt in Egypt, where, thanks to his great capability as a financier, he had rendered important services \\u2014 by Radical Cabinets under which a reactionary of the middle classes would have declined to serve, and in whose eyes M. de Norpois, in view of his past, his conne ions and his opinions, ought presumably to have been suspect. But these advanced Ministers seemed to consider that, in making such an appointment, they were shewing how broad their own minds were, when the supreme interests of France were at stake, were raising themselves above the general run of politicians, were meriting, from the Journal des D\\u00e9bats itself, the title of \\u2018Statesmen,\\u2019 and were reaping direct advantage from the weight that attaches to an aristocratic name and the dramatic interest always aroused by an une pected appointment. And they knew also that they could reap these advantages by making an appeal to M. de Norpois, without having to fear any want of political loyalty on his part, a fault against which his noble birth not only need not put them on their guard but offered a positive guarantee. And in this calculation the Government of the Republic were not mistaken. In the first place, because an aristocrat of a certain type, brought up from his cradle to regard his name as an integral part of himself of which no accident can deprive him an asset of whose value his peers, or persons of even higher rank, can form a fairly e act estimate, knows that he can dispense with the efforts since they can in no way enhance his position in which, without any appreciable result, so many public men of the middle class spend themselves \\u2014 to profess only the \\u2018right\\u2019 opinions, to frequent only the \\u2018sound\\u2019 people. An ious, on the other hand, to increase his own importance in the eyes of the princely or ducal families which take immediate precedence of his own, he knows that he can do so by giving his name that complement which hitherto it has lacked, which will give it priority over other names heraldically its equals: such as political power, a literary or an artistic reputation, or a large fortune. And so what he saves by avoiding the society of the ineffective country squires, after whom all the professional families run helter-skelter, but of his intimacy with whom, were he to profess it, a prince would think nothing, he will lavish on the politicians who free-masons, or worse, though they be can advance him in Diplomacy or \\u2018back\\u2019 him in an election, and on the artists or scientists whose patronage can help him to \\u2018arrive\\u2019 in those departments in which they e cel, on everyone, in fact, who is in a position to confer a fresh distinction or to \\u2018bring off\\u2019 a rich marriage  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 But in the character of M. de Norpois there was this predominant feature, that, in the course of a long career of diplomacy, he had become imbued with that negative, methodical, conservative spirit, called \\u2018governmental,\\u2019 which is common to all Governments and, under every Government, particularly inspires its Foreign Office. He had imbibed, during that career, an aversion, a dread, a contempt for the methods of procedure, more or less revolutionary and in any event quite incorrect, which are those of an Opposition. Save in the case of a few illiterates \\u2014 high or low, it makes no matter \\u2014 by whom no difference in quality is perceptible, what attracts men one to another is not a common point of view but a consanguinity of spirit. An Academician of the kind of Legouv\\u00e9, and therefore an upholder of the classics, would applaud Ma ime Ducamp\\u2019s or Mezi\\u00e8re\\u2019s eulogy of Victor Hugo with more fervour than that of Boileau by Claudel. A common Nationalism suffices to endear Barr\\u00e9s to his electors, who scarcely distinguish between him and M. Georges Berry, but does not endear him to those of his brother Academicians who, with a similar outlook on politics but a different type of mind, will prefer to him even such open adversaries as M. Ribot and M. Deschanel, with whom, in turn, the most loyal Monarchists feel themselves more closely allied than with Maurras or L\\u00e9on Daudet, although these also are living in the hope of a glorious Restoration. Miserly in the use of words, not only from a professional scruple of prudence and reserve, but because words themselves have more value, present more subtleties of definition to men whose efforts, protracted over a decade, to bring two countries to an understanding, are condensed, translated \\u2014 in a speech or in a protocol \\u2014 into a single adjective, colourless in all appearance, but to them pregnant with a world of meaning, M. de Norpois was considered very stiff, at the Commission, where he sat ne t to my father, whom everyone else congratulated on the astonishing way in which the old Ambassador unbent to him. My father was himself more astonished than anyone. For not being, as a rule, very affable, his company was little sought outside his own intimate circle, a limitation which he used modestly and frankly to avow. He realised that these overtures were an outcome, in the diplomat, of that point of view which everyone adopts for himself in making his choice of friends, from which all a man\\u2019s intellectual qualities, his refinement, his affection are a far less potent recommendation of him, when at the same time he bores or irritates one, than are the mere straightforwardness and good-humour of another man whom most people would regard as frivolous or even fatuous. \\u201cDe Norpois has asked me to dinner again; it\\u2019s quite e traordinary; everyone on the Commission is amazed, as he never has any personal relations with any of us. I am sure he\\u2019s going to tell me something thrilling, again, about the \\u2018Seventy war.\\u201d My father knew that M. de Norpois had warned, had perhaps been alone in warning the Emperor of the growing strength and bellicose designs of Prussia, and that Bismarck rated his intelligence most highly. Only the other day, at the Opera, during the gala performance given for King Theodosius, the newspapers had all drawn attention to the long conversation which that Monarch had held with M. de Norpois. \\u201cI must ask him whether the King\\u2019s visit had any real significance,\\u201d my father went on, for he was keenly interested in foreign politics. \\u201cI know old Norpois keeps very close as a rule, but when he\\u2019s with me he opens out quite charmingly.\\u201d \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 As for my mother, perhaps the Ambassador had not the type of mind towards which she felt herself most attracted. I should add that his conversation furnished so e haustive a glossary of the superannuated forms of speech peculiar to a certain profession, class and period \\u2014 a period which, for that profession and that class, might be said not to have altogether passed away \\u2014 that I sometimes regret that I have not kept any literal record simply of the things that I have heard him say. I should thus have obtained an effect of old-fashioned courtesy by the same process and at as little e pense as that actor at the Palais-Royal who, when asked where on earth he managed to find his astounding hats, answered, \\u201cI do not find my hats. I keep them.\\u201d In a word, I suppose that my mother considered M. de Norpois a trifle \\u2018out-of-date,\\u2019 which was by no means a fault in her eyes, so far as manners were concerned, but attracted her less in the region \\u2014 not, in this instance, of ideas, for those of M. de Norpois were e tremely modern \\u2014 but of idiom. She felt, however, that she was paying a delicate compliment to her husband when she spoke admiringly of the diplomat who had shewn so remarkable a predilection for him. By confirming in my father\\u2019s mind the good opinion that he already had of M. de Norpois, and so inducing him to form a good opinion of himself also, she knew that she was carrying out that one of her wifely duties which consisted in making life pleasant and comfortable for her husband, just as when she saw to it that his dinner was perfectly cooked and served in silence. And as she was incapable of deceiving my father, she compelled herself to admire the old Ambassador, so as to be able to praise him with sincerity. Incidentally she could naturally, and did, appreciate his kindness, his somewhat antiquated courtesy so ceremonious that when, as he was walking along the street, his tall figure rigidly erect, he caught sight of my mother driving past, before raising his hat to her he would fling away the cigar that he had just lighted; his conversation, so elaborately circumspect, in which he referred as seldom as possible to himself and always considered what might interest the person to whom he was speaking; his promptness in answering a letter, which was so astonishing that whenever my father, just after posting one himself to M. de Norpois, saw his handwriting upon an envelope, his first thought was always one of annoyance that their letters must, unfortunately, have crossed in the post; which, one was led to suppose, bestowed upon him the special and lu urious privilege of e traordinary deliveries and collections at all hours of the day and night. My mother marvelled at his being so punctilious although so busy, so friendly although so much in demand, never realising that \\u2018although,\\u2019 with such people, is invariably an unrecognised \\u2018because,\\u2019 and that just as old men are always wonderful for their age, and kings e traordinarily simple, and country cousins astonishingly well-informed it was the same system of habits that enabled M. de Norpois to undertake so many duties and to be so methodical in answering letters, to go everywhere and to be so friendly when he came to us. Moreover she made the mistake which everyone makes who is unduly modest; she rated everything that concerned herself below, and consequently outside the range of, other people\\u2019s duties and engagements. The letter which it seemed to her so meritorious in my father\\u2019s friend to have written us promptly, since in the course of the day he must have had ever so many letters to write, she e cepted from that great number of letters, of which actually it was a unit; in the same way she did not consider that dining with us was, for M. de Norpois, merely one of the innumerable activities of his social life; she never guessed that the Ambassador had trained himself, long ago, to look upon dining-out as one of his diplomatic functions, and to display, at table, an inveterate charm which it would have been too much to have e pected him specially to discard when he came to dine with us  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 The evening on which M. de Norpois first appeared at our table, in a year when I still went to play in the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es, has remained fi ed in my memory because the afternoon of the same day was that upon which I at last went to hear Berma, at a matin\\u00e9e, in Ph\\u00e8dre, and also because in talking to M. de Norpois I realised suddenly, and in a new and different way, how completely the feelings aroused in me by all that concerned Gilberte Swann and her parents differed from any that the same family could inspire in anyone else  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 It was no doubt the sight of the depression in which I was plunged by the approach of the New Year holidays, in which, as she herself had informed me, I was to see nothing of Gilberte, that prompted my mother one day, in the hope of distracting my mind, to suggest, \\u201cIf you are still so an ious to hear Berma, I think that your father would allow you perhaps to go; your grandmother can take you.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 But it was because M. de Norpois had told him that he ought to let me hear Berma, that it was an e perience for a young man to remember in later life, that my father, who had hitherto been so resolutely opposed to my going and wasting my time, with the added risk of my falling ill again, on what he used to shock my grandmother by calling \\u2018futilities,\\u2019 was now not far from regarding this manner of spending an afternoon as included, in some vague way, in the list of precious formulae for success in a brilliant career. My grandmother, who, in renouncing on my behalf the profit which, according to her, I should have derived from hearing Berma, had made a considerable sacrifice in the interests of my health, was surprised to find that this last had become of no account at a mere word from M. de Norpois. Reposing the unconquerable hopes of her rationalist spirit in the strict course of fresh air and early hours which had been prescribed for me, she now deplored, as something disastrous, this infringement that I was to make of my rules, and in a tone of despair protested, \\u201cHow easily led you are!\\u201d to my father, who replied angrily \\u201cWhat! So it\\u2019s you that are not for letting him go, now. That is really too much, after your telling us all day and every day that it would be so good for him.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 M. de Norpois had also brought about a change in my father\\u2019s plans in a matter of far greater importance to myself. My father had always meant me to become a diplomat, and I could not endure the thought that, even if I did have to stay for some years, first, at the Ministry, I should run the risk of being sent, later on, as Ambassador, to capitals in which no Gilberte dwelt. I should have preferred to return to the literary career that I had planned for myself, and had been abandoned, years before, in my wanderings along the Guermantes way. But my father had steadily opposed my devoting myself to literature, which he regarded as vastly inferior to diplomacy, refusing even to dignify it with the title of career, until the day when M. de Norpois, who had little love for the more recent generations of diplomatic agents, assured him that it was quite possible, by writing, to attract as much attention, to receive as much consideration, to e ercise as much influence, and at the same time to preserve more independence than in the Embassies  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cWell, well, I should never have believed it. Old Norpois doesn\\u2019t at all disapprove of your idea of taking up writing,\\u201d my father had reported. And as he had a certain amount of influence himself, he imagined that there was nothing that could not be \\u2018arranged,\\u2019 no problem for which a happy solution might not be found in the conversation of people who \\u2018counted.\\u2019 \\u201cI shall bring him back to dinner, one of these days, from the Commission. You must talk to him a little, and let him see what he thinks of you. Write something good that you can shew him; he is an intimate friend of the editor of the Deu -Mondes; he will get you in there; he will arrange it all, the cunning old fo ; and, upon my soul, he seems to think that diplomacy, nowadays \\u2014\\u2014!\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 My happiness in the prospect of not being separated from Gilberte made me desirous, but not capable, of writing something good which could be shewn to M. de Norpois. After a few laboured pages, weariness made the pen drop from my fingers; I cried with anger at the thought that I should never have any talent, that I was not \\u2018gifted,\\u2019 that I could not even take advantage of the chance that M. de Norpois\\u2019s coming visit was to offer me of spending the rest of my life in Paris. The recollection that I was to be taken to hear Berma alone distracted me from my grief. But just as I did not wish to see any storms e cept on those coasts where they raged with most violence, so I should not have cared to hear the great actress e cept in one of those classic parts in which Swann had told me that she touched the sublime. For when it is in the hope of making a priceless discovery that we desire to receive certain impressions from nature or from works of art, we have certain scruples about allowing our soul to gather, instead of these, other, inferior, impressions, which are liable to make us form a false estimate of the value of Beauty. Berma in Andromaque, in Les Caprices de Marianne, in Ph\\u00e8dre, was one of those famous spectacles which my imagination had so long desired. I should enjoy the same rapture as on the day when in a gondola I glided to the foot of the Titian of the Frari or the Carpaccios of San Giorgio dei Schiavoni, were I ever to hear Berma repeat the lines beginning  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cOn dit qu\\u2019un prompt d\\u00e9part vous \\u00e9loigne de \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0nous, Seigneur \\u2014 \\u2014\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 I was familiar with them from the simple reproduction in black and white which was given of them upon the printed page; but my heart beat furiously at the thought \\u2014 as of the realisation of a long-planned voyage \\u2014 that I should at length behold them, bathed and brought to life in the atmosphere and sunshine of the voice of gold. A Carpaccio in Venice, Berma in Ph\\u00e8dre, masterpieces of pictorial or dramatic art which the glamour, the dignity attaching to them made so living to me, that is to say so indivisible, that if I had been taken to see Carpaccios in one of the galleries of the Louvre, or Berma in some piece of which I had never heard, I should not have e perienced the same delicious amazement at finding myself at length, with wide-open eyes, before the unique and inconceivable object of so many thousand dreams. Then, while I waited, e pecting to derive from Berma\\u2019s playing the revelation of certain aspects of nobility and tragic grief, it would seem to me that whatever greatness, whatever truth there might be in her playing must be enhanced if the actress imposed it upon a work of real value, instead of what would, after all, be but embroidering a pattern of truth and beauty upon a commonplace and vulgar web  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Finally, if I went to hear Berma in a new piece, it would not be easy for me to judge of her art, of her diction, since I should not be able to differentiate between a te t which was not already familiar and what she added to it by her intonations and gestures, an addition which would seem to me to be embodied in the play itself; whereas the old plays, the classics which I knew by heart, presented themselves to me as vast and empty walls, reserved and made ready for my inspection, on which I should be able to appreciate without restriction the devices by which Berma would cover them, as with frescoes, with the perpetually fresh treasures of her inspiration. Unfortunately, for some years now, since she had retired from the great theatres, to make the fortune of one on the boulevards where she was the \\u2018star,\\u2019 she had ceased to appear in classic parts; and in vain did I scan the hoardings; they never advertised any but the newest pieces, written specially for her by authors in fashion at the moment. When, one morning, as I stood searching the column of announcements to find the afternoon performances for the week of the New Year holidays, I saw there for the first time \\u2014 at the foot of the bill, after some probably insignificant curtain-raiser, whose title was opaque to me because it had latent in it all the details of an action of which I was ignorant \\u2014 two acts ofPh\\u00e8dre with Mme. Berma, and, on the following afternoons, Le Demi-Monde, Les Caprices de Marianne, names which, like that of Ph\\u00e8dre, were for me transparent, filled with light only, so familiar were those works to me, illuminated to their very depths by the revealing smile of art. They seemed to me to invest with a fresh nobility Mme. Berma herself when I read in the newspapers, after the programme of these performances, that it was she who had decided to shew herself once more to the public in some of her early creations. She was conscious, then, that certain stage-parts have an interest which survives the novelty of their first production or the success of a revival; she regarded them, when interpreted by herself, as museum pieces which it might be instructive to set before the eyes of the generation which had admired her in them long ago, or of that which had never yet seen her in them. In thus advertising, in the middle of a column of plays intended only to while away an evening, this Ph\\u00e8dre, a title no longer than any of the rest, nor set in different type, she added something indescribable, as though a hostess,  ducing you, before you all go in to dinner, to her other guests, were to mention, casually, amid the string of names which are the names of guests and nothing more, and without any change of tone:\\u2014\\u201cM. Anatole France.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 The doctor who was attending me \\u2014 the same who had forbidden me to travel \\u2014 advised my parents not to let me go to the theatre; I should only be ill again afterwards, perhaps for weeks, and should in the long run derive more pain than pleasure from the e perience. The fear of this might have availed to stop me, if what I had anticipated from such a spectacle had been only a pleasure for which a subsequent pain could so compensate as to cancel it. But what I demanded from this performance \\u2014 just as from the visit to Balbec, the visit to Venice for which I had so intensely longed \\u2014 was something quite different from pleasure; a series of verities pertaining to a world more real than that in which I lived, which, once acquired, could never be taken from me again by any of the trivial incidents \\u2014 even though it were the cause of bodily suffering \\u2014 of my otiose e istence. At best, the pleasure which I was to feel during the performance appeared to me as the perhaps inevitable form of the perception of these truths; and I hoped only that the illness which had been forecast for me would not begin until the play was finished, so that my pleasure should not be in any way compromised or spoiled. I implored my parents, who, after the doctor\\u2019s visit, were no longer inclined to let me go to Ph\\u00e8dre. I repeated, all day long, to myself, the speech beginning  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cOn dit qu\\u2019un prompt d\\u00e9part vous \\u00e9loigne de nous \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\u2014 \\u2014\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 seeking out every intonation that could be put into it, so as to be able better to measure my surprise at the way which Berma would have found of uttering the lines. Concealed, like the Holy of Holies, beneath the veil that screened her from my gaze, behind which I invested her, every moment, with a fresh aspect, according to which of the words of Bergotte \\u2014 in the pamphlet that Gilberte had found for me \\u2014 was passing through my mind; \\u201cplastic nobility,\\u201d \\u201cChristian austerity\\u201d or \\u201cJansenist pallor,\\u201d \\u201cPrincess of Troezen and of Cleves\\u201d or \\u201cMycenean drama,\\u201d \\u201cDelphic symbol,\\u201d \\u201cSolar myth\\u201d; that divine Beauty, whom Berma\\u2019s acting was to reveal to me, night and day, upon an altar perpetually illumined, sat enthroned hi the sanctuary of my mind, my mind for which not itself but my stern, my fickle parents were to decide whether or not it was to enshrine, and for all time, the perfections of the Deity unveiled, in the same spot where was now her invisible form. And with my eyes fi ed upon that inconceivable image, I strove from morning to night to overcome the barriers which my family were putting in my way. But when those had at last fallen, when my mother \\u2014 albeit this matin\\u00e9e was actually to coincide with the meeting of the Commission from which my father had promised to bring M. de Norpois home to dinner \\u2014 had said to me, \\u201cVery well, we don\\u2019t wish you to be unhappy; \\u2014 if you think that you will enjoy it so very much, you must go; that\\u2019s all;\\u201d when this day of theatre-going, hitherto forbidden and unattainable, depended now only upon myself, then for the first time, being no longer troubled by the wish that it might cease to be impossible, I asked myself if it were desirable, if there were not other reasons than my parents\\u2019 prohibition which should make me abandon my design. In the first place, whereas I had been detesting them for their cruelty, their consent made them now so dear to me that the thought of causing them pain stabbed me also with a pain through which the purpose of life shewed itself as the pursuit not of truth but of loving-kindness, and life itself seemed good or evil only as my parents were happy or sad. \\u201cI would rather not go, if it hurts you,\\u201d I told my mother, who, on the contrary, strove hard to e pel from my mind any lurking fear that she might regret my going, since that, she said, would spoil the pleasure that I should otherwise derive fromPh\\u00e8dre, and it was the thought of my pleasure that had induced my father and her to re their earlier decision. But then this sort of obligation to find a pleasure in the performance seemed to me very burdensome. Besides, if I returned home ill, should I be well again in time to be able to go to the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es as soon as the holidays were over and Gilberte returned? Against all these arguments I set, so as to decide which course I should take, the idea, invisible there behind its veil, of the perfections of Berma. I cast into one pan of the scales \\u201cMaking Mamma unhappy,\\u201d \\u201crisking not being able to go on the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es,\\u201d and the other, \\u201cJansenist pallor,\\u201d \\u201cSolar myth,\\u201d until the words themselves grew dark and clouded in my mind\\u2019s vision, ceased to say anything to me, lost all their force; and gradually my hesitations became so painful that if I had now decided upon the theatre it would have been only that I might bring them to an end, and be delivered from them once and for all. It would have been to fi  a term to my sufferings, and no longer in the e pectation of an intellectual benediction, yielding to the attractions of perfection, that I would let myself be taken, not now to the Wise Goddess, but to the stern, implacable Divinity, featureless and unnamed, who had been secretly substituted for her behind the veil. But suddenly everything was altered. My desire to go and hear Berma received a fresh stimulus which enabled me to await the coming of the matin\\u00e9e with impatience and with joy; having gone to take up, in front of the column on which the playbills were, my daily station, as e cruciating, of late, as that of a stylite saint, I had seen there, still moist and wrinkled, the complete bill of Ph\\u00e8dre, which had just been pasted up for the first time and on which, I must confess, the rest of the cast furnished no additional attraction which could help me to decide. But it gave to one of the points between which my indecision wavered a form at once more concrete and \\u2014 inasmuch as the bill was dated not from the day on which I read it but from that on which the performance would take place, and from the very hour at which the curtain would rise \\u2014 almost imminent, well on the way, already, to its realisation, so that I jumped for joy before the column at the thought that on that day, and at that hour precisely, I should be sitting there in my place, ready to hear the voice of Berma; and for fear lest my parents might not now be in time to secure two good seats for my grandmother and myself, I raced back to the house, whipped on by the magic words which had now taken the place, in my mind, of \\u201cJansenist pallor\\u201d and \\u201cSolar myth\\u201d; \\u2014\\u201cLadies will not be admitted to the stalls in hats. The doors will be closed at two o\\u2019clock.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Alas! that first matin\\u00e9e was to prove a bitter disappointment. My father offered to drop my grandmother and me at the theatre, on his way to the Commission. Before leaving the house he said to my mother: \\u201cSee that you have a good dinner for us to-night; you remember, I\\u2019m bringing de Norpois back with me.\\u201d My mother had not forgotten. And all that day, and overnight, Fran\\u00e7oise, rejoicing in the opportunity to devote herself to that art of the kitchen \\u2014 of which she was indeed a past-master, stimulated, moreover, by the prospect of having a new guest to feed, the consciousness that she would have to compose, by methods known to her alone, a dish of beef in jelly \\u2014 had been living in the effervescence of creation; since she attached the utmost importance to the intrinsic quality of the materials which were to enter into the fabric of her work, she had gone herself to the Halles to procure the best cuts of rump-steak, shin of beef, calves\\u2019-feet, as Michelangelo passed eight months in the mountains of Carrara choosing the most perfect blocks of marble for the monument of Julius II\\u2014 Fran\\u00e7oise e pended on these comings and goings so much ardour that Mamma, at the sight of her flaming cheeks, was alarmed lest our old servant should make herself ill with overwork, like the sculptor of the Tombs of the Medici in the quarries of Pietrasanta. And overnight Fran\\u00e7oise had sent to be cooked in the baker\\u2019s oven, shielded with breadcrumbs, like a block of pink marble packed in sawdust, what she called a \\u201cNev\\u2019-York ham.\\u201d Believing the language to be less rich than it actually was in words, and her own ears less trustworthy, the first time that she heard anyone mention York ham she had thought, no doubt \\u2014 feeling it to be hardly conceivable that the dictionary could be so prodigal as to include at once a \\u2018York\\u2019 and a \\u2018New York\\u2019\\u2014 that she had misheard what was said, and that the ham was really called by the name already familiar to her. And so, ever since, the word York was preceded in her ears, or before her eyes when she read it in an advertisement, by the affi  \\u2018New\\u2019 which she pronounced \\u2018Nev\\u2019.\\u2019 And it was with the most perfect faith that she would say to her kitchen-maid: \\u201cGo and fetch me a ham from Olida\\u2019s. Madame told me especially to get a Nev\\u2019-York.\\u201d On that particular day, if Fran\\u00e7oise was consumed by the burning certainty of creative genius, my lot was the cruel an iety of the seeker after truth. No doubt, so long as I had not yet heard Berma speak, I still felt some pleasure. I felt it in the little square that lay in front of the theatre, in which, in two hours\\u2019 time, the bare boughs of the chestnut trees would gleam with a metallic lustre as the lighted gas-lamps shewed up every detail of their structure; before the attendants in the bo -office, the selection of whom, their promotion, all their destiny depended upon the great artist \\u2014 for she alone held power in the theatre, where ephemeral managers followed one after the other in an obscure succession \\u2014 who took our tickets without even glancing at us, so preoccupied were they with their an iety lest any of Mme. Berma\\u2019s instructions had not been duly transmitted to the new members of the staff, lest it was not clearly, everywhere, understood that the hired applause must never sound for her, that the windows must all be kept open so long as she was not on the stage, and every door closed tight, the moment that she appeared; that a bowl of hot water must be concealed somewhere close to her, to make the dust settle: and, for that matter, at any moment now her carriage, drawn by a pair of horses with flowing manes, would be stopping outside the theatre, she would alight from it muffled in furs, and, crossly acknowledging everyone\\u2019s salute, would send one of her attendants to find out whether a stage bo  had been kept for her friends, what the temperature was \\u2018in front,\\u2019 who were in the other bo es, if the programme sellers were looking smart; theatre and public being to her no more than a second, an outermost cloak which she would put on, and the medium, the more or less \\u2018good\\u2019 conductor through which her talent would have to pass. I was happy, too, in the theatre itself; since I had made the discovery that \\u2014 in contradiction of the picture so long entertained by my childish imagination \\u2014 there was but one stage for everybody, I had supposed that I should be prevented from seeing it properly by the presence of the other spectators, as one is when in the thick of a crowd; now I registered the fact that, on the contrary, thanks to an arrangement which is, so to speak, symbolical of all spectatorship, everyone feels himself to be the centre of the theatre; which e plained to me why, when Fran\\u00e7oise had been sent once to see some melodrama from the top gallery, she had assured us on her return that her seat had been the best in the house, and that instead of finding herself too far from the stage she had been positively frightened by the mysterious and living pro imity of the curtain. My pleasure increased further when I began to distinguish behind the said lowered curtain such confused rappings as one hears through the shell of an egg before the chicken emerges, sounds which speedily grew louder and suddenly, from that world which, impenetrable by our eyes, yet scrutinised us with its own, addressed themselves, and to us indubitably, in the imperious form of three consecutive hammer-blows as moving as any signals from the planet Mars. And \\u2014 once this curtain had risen \\u2014 when on the stage a writing-table and a fireplace, in no way out of the ordinary, had indicated that the persons who were about to enter would be, not actors come to recite, as I had seen them once and heard them at an evening party, but real people, just living their lives at home, on whom I was thus able to spy without their seeing me \\u2014 my pleasure still endured; it was broken by a momentary uneasiness; just as I was straining my ears in readiness before the piece began, two men entered the theatre from the side of the stage, who must have been very angry with each other, for they were talking so loud that in the auditorium, where there were at least a thousand people, we could hear every word, whereas in quite a small caf\\u00e9 one is obliged to call the waiter and ask what it is that two men, who appear to be quarrelling, are saying; but at that moment, while I sat astonished to find that the audience was listening to them without protest, drowned as it was in a universal silence upon which broke, presently, a laugh here and there, I understood that these insolent fellows were the actors and that the short piece known as the \\u2018curtain-raiser\\u2019 had now begun. It was followed by an interval so long that the audience, who had returned to their places, grew impatient and began to stamp their feet. I was terrified at this; for just as in the report of a criminal trial, when I read that some noble-minded person was coming, against his own interests, to testify on behalf of an innocent prisoner, I was always afraid that they would not be nice enough to him, would not shew enough gratitude, would not recompense him lavishly, and that he, in disgust, would then range himself on the side of injustice; so now attributing to genius, in this respect, the same qualities as to virtue, I was afraid lest Berma, annoyed by the bad behaviour of so ill-bred an audience \\u2014 in which, on the other hand, I should have liked her to recognise, with satisfaction, a few celebrities to whose judgment she would be bound to attach importance \\u2014 should e press her discontent and disdain by acting badly. And I gazed appealingly round me at these stamping brutes who were about to shatter, in their insensate rage, the rare and fragile impression which I had come to seek. The last moments of my pleasure were during the opening scenes of Ph\\u00e8dre. The heroine herself does not appear in these first scenes of the second act; and yet, as soon as the curtain rose, and another curtain, of red velvet this time, was parted in the middle a curtain which was used to halve the depth of the stage in all the plays in which the \\u2018star\\u2019 appeared, an actress entered from the back who had the face and voice which, I had been told, were those of Berma. The cast must therefore have been changed; all the trouble that I had taken in studying the part of the wife of Theseus was wasted. But a second actress now responded to the first. I must, then, have been mistaken in supposing that the first was Berma, for the second even more closely resembled her, and, more than the other, had her diction. Both of them, moreover, enriched their parts with noble gestures \\u2014 which I could vividly distinguish, and could appreciate in their relation to the te t, while they raised and let fall the lovely folds of their tunics \\u2014 and also with skilful changes of tone, now passionate, now ironical, which made me realise the significance of lines that I had read to myself at home without paying sufficient attention to what they really meant. But all of a sudden, in the cleft of the red curtain that veiled her sanctuary, as in a frame, appeared a woman, and simultaneously with the fear that seized me, far more ve ing than Berma\\u2019s fear could be, lest someone should upset her by opening a window, or drown one of her lines by rustling a programme, or annoy her by applauding the others and by not applauding her enough; \\u2014 in my own fashion, still more absolute than Berma\\u2019s, of considering from that moment theatre, audience, play and my own body only as an acoustic medium of no importance, save in the degree to which it was favourable to the infle ions of that voice \\u2014 I realised that the two actresses whom I had been for some minutes admiring bore not the least resemblance to her whom I had come to hear. But at the same time all my pleasure had ceased; in vain might I strain towards Berma\\u2019s eyes, ears, mind, so as not to let one morsel escape me of the reasons which she would furnish for my admiring her, I did not succeed in gathering a single one. I could not even, as I could with her companions, distinguish in her diction and in her playing intelligent intonations, beautiful gestures. I listened to her as though I were readingPh\\u00e8dre, or as though Phaedra herself had at that moment uttered the words that I was hearing, without its appearing that Berma\\u2019s talent had added anything at all to them. I could have wished, so as to be able to e plore them fully, so as to attempt to discover what it was in them that was beautiful, to arrest, to immobilise for a time before my senses every intonation of the artist\\u2019s voice, every e pression of her features; at least I did attempt, by dint of my mental agility in having, before a line came, my attention ready and tuned to catch it, not to waste upon preparations any morsel of the precious time that each word, each gesture occupied, and, thanks to the intensity of my observation, to manage to penetrate as far into them as if I had had whole hours to spend upon them, by myself. But how short their duration was! Scarcely had a sound been received by my ear than it was displaced there by another. In one scene, where Berma stands motionless for a moment, her arm raised to the level of a face bathed, by some piece of stagecraft, in a greenish light, before a back-cloth painted to represent the sea, the whole house broke out in applause; but already the actress had moved, and the picture that I should have liked to study e isted no longer. I told my grandmother that I could not see very well; she handed me her glasses. Only, when one believes in the reality of a thing, making it visible by artificial means is not quite the same as feeling that it is close at hand. I thought now that it was no longer Berma at whom I was looking, but her image in a magnifying glass. I put the glasses down, but then possibly the image that my eye received of her, diminished by distance, was no more e act; which of the two Bermas was the real? As for her speech to Hippolyte, I had counted enormously upon that, since, to judge by the ingenious significance which her companions were disclosing to me at every moment in less beautiful parts, she would certainly render it with intonations more surprising than any which, when reading the play at home, I had contrived to imagine; but she did not attain to the heights which \\u0152none or Aricie would naturally have reached, she planed down into a uniform flow of melody the whole of a passage in which there were mingled together contradictions so striking that the least intelligent of tragic actresses, even the pupils of an academy, could not have missed their effect; besides which, she ran through the speech so rapidly that it was only when she had come to the last line that my mind became aware of the deliberate monotony which she had imposed on it throughout  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Then, at last, a sense of admiration did possess me, provoked by the frenzied applause of the audience. I mingled my own with theirs, endeavouring to prolong the general sound so that Berma, in her gratitude, should surpass herself, and I be certain of having heard her on one of her great days. A curious thing, by the way, was that the moment when this storm of public enthusiasm broke loose was, as I afterwards learned, that in which Berma reveals one of her richest treasures. It would appear that certain transcendent realities emit all around them a radiance to which the crowd is sensitive. So it is that when any great event occurs, when on a distant frontier an army is in jeopardy, or defeated, or victorious, the vague and conflicting reports which we receive, from which an educated man can derive little enlightenment, stimulate in the crowd an emotion by which that man is surprised, and in which, once e pert criticism has informed him of the actual military situation, he recognises the popular perception of that \\u2018aura\\u2019 which surrounds momentous happenings, and which may be visible hundreds of miles away. One learns of a victory either after the war is over, or at once, from the hilarious joy of one\\u2019s hall porter. One discovers the touch of genius in Berma\\u2019s acting a week after one has heard her, in the criticism of some review, or else on the spot, from the thundering acclamation of the stalls. But this immediate recognition by the crowd was mingled with a hundred others, all quite erroneous; the applause came, most often, at wrong moments, apart from the fact that it was mechanically produced by the effect of the applause that had gone before, just as in a storm, once the sea is sufficiently disturbed, it will continue to swell, even after the wind has begun to subside. No matter; the more I applauded, the better, it seemed to me, did Berma act. \\u201cI say,\\u201d came from a woman sitting near me, of no great social pretensions, \\u201cshe fairly gives it you, she does; you\\u2019d think she\\u2019d do herself an injury, the way she runs about. I call that acting, don\\u2019t you?\\u201d And happy to find these reasons for Berma\\u2019s superiority, though not without a suspicion that they no more accounted for it than would for that of the Gioconda or of Benvenuto\\u2019s Perseus a peasant\\u2019s gaping \\u201cThat\\u2019s a good bit of work. It\\u2019s all gold, look! Fine, ain\\u2019t it?\\u201d, I greedily imbibed the strong wine of this popular enthusiasm. I felt, all the same, when the curtain had fallen fer the last time, disappointed that the pleasure for which I had so longed had been no greater, but at the same time I felt the need to prolong it, not to depart for ever, when I left the theatre, from this strange life of the stage which had, for a few hours, been my own, from which I should be tearing myself away, as though I were going into e ile, when I returned to my; own home, had I not hoped there to learn a great deal more about Berma from her admirer, to whom I was indebted already for the permission to go to Ph\\u00e8dre, M. de Norpois. I was  duced to him before dinner by my father, who summoned me into his study for the purpose. As I entered, the Ambassador rose, held out his hand, bowed his tall figure and fi ed his blue eyes attentively on my face. As the foreign visitors who used to be presented to him, in the days when he still represented France abroad, were all more or less even the famous singers persons of note, with regard to whom he could tell, when he met them, that he would be able to say, later on, when he heard then \\u2014 names mentioned in Paris or in Petersburg, that he remembered perfectly the evening he had spent with them at Munich or Sofia, he had formed the habit of impressing upon them, by his affability, the pleasure with which he was making their acquaintance; but in addition to this, being convinced that in the life of European capitals, in contact at once with all the interesting personalities that passed through them and with the manners and customs of the native populations, one acquired a deeper insight than could be gained from books into the intellectual movement throughout Europe, he would e ercise upon each newcomer his keen power of observation, so as to decide at once with what manner of man he had to deal. The Government had not for some time now entrusted to him a post abroad, but still, as soon as anyone was  duced to him, his eyes, as though they had not yet been informed of their master\\u2019s retirement, began their fruitful observation, while by his whole attitude he endeavoured to convey that the stranger\\u2019s name was not unknown to him. And so, all the time, while he spoke to me kindly and with the air of importance of a man who is conscious of the vastness of his own e perience, he never ceased to e amine me with a sagacious curiosity, and to his own profit, as though I had been some e otic custom, some historic and instruct tive building or some \\u2018star\\u2019 upon his course. And in this way he gave proof at once, in his attitude towards me, of the majestic benevolence of the sage Mentor and of the zealous curiosity of the young Anacharsis  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 He offered me absolutely no opening to the Revue des Deu -Mondes, but put a number of questions to me on what I had been doing and reading; asked what were my own inclinations, which I heard thus spoken of for the first time as though it might be a quite reasonable thing to obey their promptings, whereas hitherto I had always supposed it to be my duty to suppress them. Since they attracted me towards Literature, he did not dissuade me from that course; on the contrary, he spoke of it with deference, as of some venerable personage whose select circle, in Rome or at Dresden, one remembers with pleasure, and regrets only that one\\u2019s multifarious duties in life enable one to revisit it so seldom. He appeared to be envying me, with an almost jovial smile, the delightful hours which, more fortunate than himself and more free, I should be able to spend with such a Mistress. But the very terms that he employed shewed me Literature as something entirely different from the image that I had formed of it at Combray, and I realised that I had been doubly right in abandoning my intention. Until now, I had reckoned only that I had not the \\u2018gift\\u2019 for writing; now M. de Norpois took from me the ambition also. I wanted to e press to him what had been my dreams; trembling with emotion, I was painfully apprehensive that all the words which I could utter would not be the sincerest possible equivalent of what I had felt, what I had never yet attempted to formulate; that is to say that my words had no clear significance. Perhaps by a professional habit, perhaps by virtue of the calm that is acquired by every important personage whose advice is commonly sought, and who, knowing that he will keep the control of the conversation in his own hands, allows the other party to fret, to struggle, to take his time; perhaps also to emphasize the dignity of his head Greek, according to himself, despite his sweeping whiskers, M. de Norpois, while anything was being e plained to him, would preserve a facial immobility as absolute as if you had been addressing some ancient and unhearing bust in a museum. Until suddenly, falling upon you like an auctioneer\\u2019s hammer, or a Delphic oracle, the Ambassador\\u2019s voice, as he replied to you, would be all the more impressive, in that nothing in his face had allowed you to guess what sort of impression you had made on him, or what opinion he was about to e press  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cPrecisely;\\u201d he suddenly began, as though the case were now heard and judged, and after allowing me to writhe in increasing helplessness beneath those motionless eyes which never for an instant left my face. \\u201cThere is the case of the son of one of my friends, which, mutatis mutandis, is very much like yours.\\u201d He adopted in speaking of our common tendency the same reassuring tone as if it had been a tendency not to literature but to rheumatics, and he had wished to assure me that it would not necessarily prove fatal. \\u201cHe too has chosen to leave the Quai d\\u2019Orsay, although the way had been paved for him there by his father, and without caring what people might say, he has settled down to write. And certainly, he\\u2019s had no reason to regret it. He published two years ago \\u2014 of course, he\\u2019s much older than you, you understand \\u2014 a book dealing with the Sense of the Infinite on the Western Shore of Victoria Nyanza, and this year he has brought out a little thing, not so important as the other, but very brightly, in places perhaps almost too pointedly written, on the Repeating Rifle in the Bulgarian Army; and these have put him quite in a class by himself. He\\u2019s gone pretty far already, and he\\u2019s not the sort of man to stop half way; I happen to know that without any suggestion, of course, of his standing for election his name has been mentioned several times, in conversation, and not at all unfavourably, at the Academy of Moral Sciences. And so, one can\\u2019t say yet, of course, that he has reached the pinnacle of fame, still he has made his way, by sheer industry, to a very fine position indeed, and success \\u2014 which doesn\\u2019t always come only to agitators and mischief-makers and men who make trouble which is usually more than they are prepared to take \\u2014 success has crowned his efforts.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 My father, seeing me already, in a few years\\u2019 time, an Academician, was tasting a contentment which M. de Norpois raised to the supreme pitch when, after a momentary hesitation in which he appeared to be calculating the possible consequences of so rash an act, he handed me his card and said: \\u201cWhy not go and see him yourself? Tell him I sent you. He may be able to give you some good advice,\\u201d plunging me by his words into as painful a state of an iety as if he had told me that, ne t morning, I was to embark as cabin-boy on board a sailing ship, and to go round the world  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 My Aunt L\\u00e9onie had bequeathed to me, together with all sorts of other things and much of her furniture, with which it was difficult to know what to do, almost all her unsettled estate \\u2014 revealing thus after her death an affection for me which I had hardly suspected in her lifetime. My father, who was trustee of this estate until I came of age, now consulted M. de Norpois with regard to several of the investments. He recommended certain stocks bearing a low rate of interest, which he considered particularly sound, notably English consols and Russian four per cents. \\u201cWith absolutely first class securities such as those,\\u201d said M. de Norpois, \\u201ceven if your income from them is nothing very great, you may be certain of never losing any of your capital.\\u201d My father then told him, roughly, what else he had bought. M. de Norpois gave a just perceptible smile of congratulation; like all capitalists, he regarded wealth as an enviable thing, but thought it more delicate to compliment people upon their possessions only by a half-indicated sign of intelligent sympathy; on the other hand, as he was himself immensely rich, he felt that he shewed his good taste by seeming to regard as considerable the meagre revenues of his friends, with a happy and comforting resilience to the superiority of his own. He made amends for this by congratulating my father, without hesitation, on the \\u201ccomposition\\u201d of his list of investments, selected \\u201cwith so sure, so delicate, so fine a taste.\\u201d You would have supposed, to hear him, that he attributed to the relative values of investments, and even to investments themselves, something akin to aesthetic merit. Of one, comparatively recent and still little known, which my father mentioned, M. de Norpois, like the people who have always read the books of which, you imagine, you yourself alone have ever heard, said at once, \\u201cAh, yes, I used to amuse myself for some time with watching it in the papers; it was quite interesting,\\u201d with the retrospective smile of a regular subscriber who has read the latest novel already, in monthly instalments, in his magazine. \\u201cIt would not be at all a bad idea to apply for some of this new issue. It is distinctly attractive; they are offering it at a most tempting discount.\\u201d But when he came to some of the older investments, my father, who could not remember their e act names, which it was easy to confuse with others of the same kind, opened a drawer and shewed the securities themselves to the Ambassador. The sight of them enchanted me. They were ornamented with cathedral spires and allegorical figures, like the old, romantic editions that I had pored over as a child. All the products of one period have something in common; the artists who illustrate the poetry of their generation are the same artists who are employed by the big financial houses. And nothing reminds me so much of the monthly parts of Notre-Dame de Paris, and of various books by G\\u00e9rard de Nerval, that used to hang outside the grocer\\u2019s door at Combray, than does, in its rectangular and flowery border, supported by recumbent river-gods, a \\u2018personal share\\u2019 in the Water Company  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 The contempt which my father had for my kind of intelligence was so far tempered by his natural affection for me that, in practice, his attitude towards anything that I might do was one of blind indulgence. And so he had no qualm about telling me to fetch a little \\u2018prose poem\\u2019 which I had made up, years before, at Combray, while coming home from a walk. I had written it down in a state of e altation which must, I felt certain, infect everyone who read it. But it was not destined to captivate M. de Norpois, for he handed it back to me without a word  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 My mother, who had the most profound respect for all my father\\u2019s occupations, came in now, timidly, to ask whether dinner might be served. She was afraid to interrupt a conversation in which she herself could have no part. And indeed my father was continually reminding the Marquis of some useful suggestion which they had decided to make at the ne t meeting of the Commission; speaking in the peculiar tone always adopted, when in a strange environment by a pair of colleagues \\u2014 as e clusive, in this respect, as two young men from the same college \\u2014 whose professional routine has furnished them with a common fund of memories to which the others present have no access, and to which they are unwilling to refer before an audience  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 But the absolute control over his facial muscles to which M. de Norpois had attained allowed him to listen without seeming to hear a word. At last my father became uneasy. \\u201cI had thought,\\u201d he ventured, after an endless preamble, \\u201cof asking the advice of the Commission . . . \\u201d Then from the face of the noble virtuoso, who had been sitting inert as a player in an orchestra sits until the moment comes for him to begin his part, were uttered, with an even delivery, on a sharp note, and as though they were no more than the completion but scored for a different voice of the phrase that my father had begun, the words: \\u201cof which you will not hesitate, of course, to call a meeting; more especially as the present members are all known to you personally, and there may be a change any day.\\u201d This was not in itself a very remarkable ending. But the immobility that had preceded it made it detach itself with the crystal clarity, the almost malicious une pectedness of those phrases in which the piano, silent until then,\\u2018takes up at a given moment, the violoncello to which one has just been listening, in a Mozart concerto  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cWell, did you enjoy your matin\\u00e9e?\\u201d asked my father, as we moved to the dining-room; meaning me to \\u2018shew off,\\u2019 and with the idea that my enthusiasm would give M. de Norpois a good opinion of me. \\u201cHe has just been to hear Berma. You remember, we were talking about it the other day,\\u201d he went on, turning towards the diplomat, in the same tone of retrospective, technical, mysterious allusiveness as if he had been referring to a meeting of the Commission  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cYou must have been enchanted, especially if you had never heard her before. Your father was alarmed at the effect that the little jaunt might have upon your health, which is none too good, I am told, none too robust. But I soon set his mind at rest. Theatres to-day are not what they were even twenty years ago. You have more or less comfortable seats now, and a certain amount of ventilation, although we have still a long way to go before we come up to Germany or England, which in that respect as in many others are immeasurably ahead of us. I have never seen Mme. Berma in Ph\\u00e8dre, but I have always heard that she is e cellent in the part. You were charmed with her, of course?\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 M. de Norpois, a man a thousand times more intelligent than myself, must know that hidden truth which I had failed to e tract from Berma\\u2019s playing; he knew, and would reveal it to me; in answering his question I would implore him to let me know in what that truth consisted; and he would tell me, and so justify me in the longing that I had felt to see and hear the actress. I had only a moment, I must make what use I could of it and bring my cross-e amination to bear upon the essential points. But what were they? Fastening my whole attention upon my own so confused impressions, with no thought of making M. de Norpois admire me, but only that of learning from him the truth that I had still to discover, I made no attempt to substitute ready-made phrases for the words that failed me \\u2014 I stood there stammering, until finally, in the hope of provoking him into declaring what there was in Berma that was admirable, I confessed that I had been disappointed  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that?\\u201d cried my father, annoyed at the bad impression which this admission of my failure to appreciate the performance must make on M. de Norpois, \\u201cWhat on earth do you mean; you didn\\u2019t enjoy it? Why, your grandmother has been telling us that you sat there hanging on every word that Berma uttered, with your eyes starting out of your head; that everyone else in the theatre seemed quite bored, beside you.\\u201d \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cOh, yes, I was listening as hard as I could, trying to find out what it was that was supposed to be so wonderful about her. Of course, she\\u2019s frightfully good, and all that . . . \\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cIf she is \\u2018frightfully good,\\u2019 what more do you want?\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cOne of the things that have undoubtedly contributed to the success of Mme. Berma,\\u201d resumed M. de Norpois, turning with elaborate courtesy towards my mother, so as not to let her be left out of the conversation, and in conscientious fulfilment of his duty of politeness to the lady of the house, \\u201cis the perfect taste that she shews in selecting her parts; thus she can always be assured of success, and success of the right sort. She hardly ever appears in anything trivial. Look how she has thrown herself into the part of Ph\\u00e8dre. And then, she brings the same good taste to the choice of her costumes, and to her acting. In spite of her frequent and lucrative tours in England and America, the vulgarity \\u2014 I will not say of John Bull; that would be unjust, at any rate to the England of the Victorian era \\u2014 but of Uncle Sam has not infected her. No loud colours, no rant. And then that admirable voice, which has been of such service to her, with which she plays so delightfully \\u2014 I should almost be tempted to describe it as a musical instrument!\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 My interest in Berma\\u2019s acting had continued to grow ever since the fall of the curtain, because it was then no longer compressed within the limits of reality; but I felt the need to find e planations for it; moreover it had been fi ed with the same intensity, while Berma was on the stage, upon everything that she offered, in the indivisibility of a living whole, to my eyes and ears; there was nothing separate or distinct; it welcomed, accordingly, the discovery of a reasonable cause in these tributes paid to the simplicity, to the good taste of the actress, it attracted them to itself by its power of absorption, seized hold of them, as the optimism of a drunken man seizes hold of the actions of his neighbour, in each of which he finds an e cuse for emotion. \\u201cHe is right!\\u201d I told myself. \\u201cWhat a charming voice, what an absence of shrillness, what simple costumes, what intelligence to have chosen Ph\\u00e8dre. No; I have not been disappointed!\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 The cold beef, spiced with carrots, made its appearance, couched by the Michelangelo of our kitchen upon enormous crystals of jelly, like transparent blocks of quartz  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cYou have a chef of the first order, Madame,\\u201d said M. de Norpois, \\u201cand that is no small matter. I myself, who have had, when abroad, to maintain a certain style in housekeeping, I know how difficult it often is to find a perfect master-cook. But this is a positive banquet that you have set before us!\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 And indeed Fran\\u00e7oise, in the e citement of her ambition to make a success, for so distinguished a guest, of a dinner the preparation of which had been obstructed by difficulties worthy of her powers, had given herself such trouble as she no longer took when we were alone, and had recaptured her incomparable Combray manner  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cThat is a thing you can\\u2019t get in a chophouse \\u2014 in the best of them, I mean; a spiced beef in which the jelly does not taste of glue and the beef has caught the flavour of the carrots; it is admirable! Allow me to come again,\\u201d he went on, making a sign to shew that he wanted more of the jelly. \\u201cI should be interested to see how your Vatel managed a dish of quite a different kind; I should like, for instance, to see him tackle a boeuf Stroganoff.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 M. de Norpois, so as to add his own contribution to the gaiety of the repast, entertained us with a number of the stories with which he was in the habit of regaling his colleagues in \\u201cthe career,\\u201d quoting now some ludicrous sentence uttered by a politician, an old offender, whose sentences were always long and packed with incoherent images, now some monumental epigram of a diplomat, sparkling with attic salt. But, to tell the truth, the criterion which for him set apart these two kinds of phrase in no way resembled that which I was in the habit of applying to literature.. Most of the finer shades escaped me; the words which he repeated with derision seemed to me not to differ very greatly from those which he found remarkable. He belonged to the class of men who, had we come to discuss the books that I liked, would have said: \\u201cSo you understand that, do you? I must confess that I do not understand, I am not initiated;\\u201d but I could have matched his attitude, for I did not grasp the wit or folly, the eloquence or pomposity which he found in a statement or a speech, and the absence of any perceptible reason for one\\u2019s being badly and the other\\u2019s well e pressed made that sort of literature seem more mysterious, more obscure to me than any other. I could distinguish only that to repeat what everybody else was thinking was, in politics, the mark not of an inferior but of a superior mind. When M. de Norpois made use of certain e pressions which were \\u2018common form\\u2019 in the newspapers, and uttered them with emphasis, one felt that they became an official pronouncement by the mere fact of his having employed them, and a pronouncement which would provoke a string of comment  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 My mother was counting greatly upon the pineapple and truffle salad. But the Ambassador, after fastening for a moment on the confection the penetrating gaze of a trained observer, ate it with the inscrutable discretion of a diplomat, and without disclosing to us what he thought of it. My mother insisted upon his taking some more, which he did, but saying only, in place of the compliment for which she was hoping: \\u201cI obey, Madame, for I can see that it is, on your part, a positive ukase!\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cWe saw in the \\u2018papers that you had a long talk with King Theodosius,\\u201d my father ventured  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cWhy, yes; the King, who has a wonderful memory for faces, was kind enough to remember, when he noticed me in the stalls, that I had had the honour to meet him on several occasions at the Court of Bavaria, at a time when he had never dreamed of his oriental throne \\u2014 to which, as you know, he was summoned by a European Congress, and indeed had grave doubts about accepting the invitation, regarding that particular sovereignty as unworthy of his race, the noblest, heraldically speaking, in the whole of Europe. An aide-de-camp came down to bid me pay my respects to his Majesty, whose command I hastened, naturally, to obey.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cAnd I trust, you are satisfied with the results of his visit?\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cEnchanted! One was justified in feeling some apprehension as to the manner in which a Sovereign who is still so young would handle a situation requiring tact, particularly at this highly delicate juncture. For my own part, I reposed entire confidence in the King\\u2019s political sense. But I must confess that he far surpassed my e pectations. The speech that he made at the Elys\\u00e9e, which, according to information that has come to me from a most authoritative source, was composed, from beginning to end, by himself, was fully deserving of the interest that it has aroused in all quarters. It was simply masterly; a trifle daring, I quite admit, but with an audacity which, after all, has been fully justified by the event. Traditional diplomacy is all very well in its way, but in practice it has made his country and ours live in an hermetically sealed atmosphere in which it was no longer possible to breathe. Very well! There is one method of letting in fresh air, obviously not one of the methods which one could officially recommend, but one which King Theodosius might allow himself to adopt \\u2014 and that is to break the windows. Which he accordingly did, with a spontaneous good humour that delighted everybody, and also with an aptness in his choice of words in which one could at once detect the race of scholarly princes from whom he is descended through his mother. There can be no question that when he spoke of the \\u2018affinities\\u2019 that bound his country to France, the e pression, rarely as it may occur in the vocabulary of the Chancellories, was a singularly happy one. You see that literary ability is no drawback, even in diplomacy, even upon a throne,\\u201d he went on, turning for a moment to myself. \\u201cThe community of interests had long been apparent, I quite admit, and the relations of the two Powers were e cellent. Still, it needed putting into words. The word was what we were all waiting for, it was chosen with marvellous aptitude; you have seen the effect it had. For my part, I must confess I applauded openly.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cYour friend M. de Vaugoubert will be pleased, after preparing for the agreement all these years.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cAll the more so that his Majesty, who is quite incorrigible, really, in some ways, had taken care to spring it on him as a surprise. And it did come as a complete surprise, incidentally, to everyone concerned, beginning with the Foreign Minister himself, who \\u2014 I have heard \\u2014 did not find it at all to his liking. It appears that someone spoke to him about it and that he replied, pretty sharply, and loud enough to be overheard by the people on either side of them: \\u2018I have been neither consulted nor informed!\\u2019 indicating clearly by that that he declined to accept any responsibility for the consequences. I must own that the incident has given rise to a great deal of comment, and I should not go so far as to deny,\\u201d he went on with a malicious smile, \\u201cthat certain of my colleagues, for whom the supreme law appears to be that of inertia, may have been shaken from their habitual repose. As for Vaugoubert, you are aware that he has been bitterly attacked for his policy of bringing that country into closer relations with France, which must have been more than ordinarily painful to him, he is so sensitive, such an e quisite nature. I can amply testify to that, since, for all that he is considerably my junior, I have had many dealings with him, we are friends of long standing and I know him intimately. Besides, who could help knowing him? His is a heart of crystal. Indeed, that is the one fault that there is to be found with him; it is not necessary for the heart of a diplomat to be as transparent as all that. Still, that does not prevent their talking of sending him to Rome, which would be a fine rise for him, but a pretty big plum to swallow. Between ourselves, I fancy that Vaugoubert, utterly devoid of ambition as he is, would be very well pleased, and would by no means ask for that cup to pass from him. For all we know, he may do wonders down there; he is the chosen candidate of the Consulta, and for my part I can see him very well placed, with his artistic leanings, in the setting of the Farnese Palace and the Caracci Gallery. At least you would suppose that it was impossible for any one to hate him; but there is a whole camarilla collected round King Theodosius which is more or less held in fief by the Wilhelmstrasse, whose inspiration its members dutifully absorb, and these men have done everything in their power to checkmate him. Not only has Vaugoubert had to face these backstairs intrigues, he has had to endure also the insults of a gang of hireling pamphleteers who later on, being like every subsidised journalist the most arrant cowards, have been the first to cry quits, but in the interval had not shrunk from hurling at our Representative the most fatuous accusations that the wit of irresponsible fools could invent. For a month and more Vaugoubert\\u2019s enemies had been dancing round him, howling for his scalp,\\u201d M. de Norpois detached this word with shacp emphasis. \\u201cBut forewarned is forearmed; as for their insults, he spurned them with his foot!\\u201d he went on with even more determination, and with so fierce a glare in his eye that for a moment we forgot our food. \\u201cIn the words of a fine Arab proverb, \\u2018The dogs may bark; the caravan goes on!\\u2019\\u201d After launching this quotation M. de Norpois paused and e amined our faces, to see what effect it had had upon us. Its effect was great, the proverb being familiar to us already. It had taken the place, that year, among people who \\u2018really counted,\\u2019 of \\u201cHe who sows the wind shall reap the whirlwind,\\u201d which was sorely in need of a rest, not having the perennial freshness of \\u201cWorking for the King of Prussia.\\u201d For the culture of these eminent men was an alternate, if not a tripartite and triennial culture. Of course, the use of quotations such as these, with which M. de Norpois e celled in jewelling his articles in the Revue, was in no way essential to their appearing solid and well-informed. Even without the ornament which the quotations supplied, it sufficed that M. de Norpois should write at a given point as he never failed to write: \\u201cThe Court of St. James\\u2019s was not the last to be sensible of the peril,\\u201d or \\u201cFeeling ran high on the Singers\\u2019 Bridge, which with an ious eyes was following the selfish but skilful policy of the Dual Monarchy,\\u201d or \\u201cA cry of alarm sounded from Montecitorio,\\u201d or yet again, \\u201cThat everlasting double-dealing which is so characteristic of the Ballplatz.\\u201d By these e pressions the profane reader had at once recognised and had paid deference to the diplomat de carri\\u00e8re. But what had made people say that he was something more than that, that he was endowed with a superior culture, had been his careful use of quotations, the perfect e ample of which, at that date, was still: \\u201cGive me a good policy and I will give you good finances, to quote the favourite words of Baron Louis\\u201c: for we had not yet imported from the Far East: \\u201cVictory is on the side that can hold out a quarter of an hour longer than the other,as the Japanese say.\\u201d This reputation for immense literary gifts, combined with a positive genius for intrigue which he kept concealed beneath a mask of indifference, had secured the election of M. de Norpois to the Acad\\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales. And there were some who even thought that he would riot be out of place in the Acad\\u00e9mie Fran\\u00e7aise, on the famous day when, wishing to indicate that it was only by drawing the Russian Alliance closer that we could hope to arrive at an understanding with Great Britain, he had not hesitated to write: \\u201cBe it clearly understood in the Quai d\\u2019Orsay, be it taught henceforward in all the manuals of geography, which appear to be incomplete in this respect, be his certificate of graduation remorselessly withheld from every candidate who has not learned to say, \\u2018If all roads lead to Rome, nevertheless the way from Paris to London runs of necessity through St. Petersburg.\\u2019\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cIn short,\\u201d M. de Norpois went on, addressing my father, \\u201cVaugoubert has won himself considerable distinction from this affair, quite beyond anything on which he can have reckoned. He e pected, you understand, a correctly worded speech which, after the storm-clouds of recent years, would have been something to the good but nothing more. Several persons who had the honour to be present have assured me that it is impossible, when one merely reads the speech, to form any conception of the effect that it produced when uttered \\u2014 when articulated with marvellous clearness of diction by the King, who is a master of the art of public speaking and in that passage underlined every possible shade of meaning. I allowed myself, in this conne ion, to listen to a little anecdote which brings into prominence once again that frank, boyish charm by which King Theo-dosius has won so many hearts. I am assured that, just as he uttered that word \\u2018affinities,\\u2019 which was, of course, the startling innovation of the speech, and one that, as you will see, will provoke discussion in the Chancellories for years to come, his Majesty, anticipating the delight of our Ambassador, who was to find in that word the seal, the crown set upon all his labours, on his dreams, one might almost say, and, in a word, his marshal\\u2019s baton, made a half turn towards Vaugoubert and fi ing upon him his arresting gaze, so characteristic of the Oettingens, fired at him that admirably chosen word \\u2018affinities,\\u2019 a positive treasure-trove, uttering it in a tone which made it plain to all his hearers that it was employed of set purpose and with full knowledge of the circumstances. It appears that Vaugoubert found some difficulty in mastering his emotion, and I must confess that, to a certain e tent, I can well understand it. Indeed, a person who is entirely to be believed has told me, in confidence, that the King came up to Vaugoubert after the dinner, when His Majesty was holding an informal court, and was heard to say, \\u2018Well, are you satisfied with your pupil, my dear Marquis?\\u2019  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cOne thing, however,\\u201d M. de Norpois concluded, \\u201cis certain; and that is that a speech like that has done more than twenty years of negotiation towards bringing the two countries together, uniting their \\u2018affinities,\\u2019 to borrow the picturesque e pression of Theodosius II. It is no more than a word, if you like, but look what success it has had, how the whole of the European press is repeating it, what interest it has aroused, what a new note it has struck. Besides it is distinctly in the young Sovereign\\u2019s manner. I will not go so far as to say that he lights upon a diamond of that water every day. But it is very seldom that, in his prepared speeches, or better still in the impulsive flow of his conversation, he does not reveal his character \\u2014 I was on the point of saying \\u2018does not affi  his signature\\u2019\\u2014 by the use of some incisive word. I myself am quite free from any suspicion of partiality in this respect, for I am stoutly opposed to all innovations in terminology. Nine times out of ten they are most dangerous.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cYes, I was thinking, only the other day, that the German Emperor\\u2019s telegram could not be much to your liking,\\u201d said my father  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 M. de Norpois raised his eyes to heaven, as who should say, \\u201cOh, that fellow!\\u201d before he replied: \\u201cIn the first place, it is an act of ingratitude. It is more than a crime; it is a blunder, and one of a crassness which I can describe only as pyramidal! Indeed, unless some one puts a check on his activities, the man who has got rid of Bismarck is quite capable of repudiating by degrees the whole of the Bismarckian policy; after which it will be a leap in the dark.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cMy husband tells me, sir, that you are perhaps going to take him to Spain one summer; that will be nice for him; I am so glad.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cWhy, yes; it is an idea that greatly attracts me; I amuse myself, planning a tour. I should like to go there with you, my dear fellow. But what about you, Madame; have you decided yet how you are going to spend your holidays?\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cI shall perhaps go with my son to Balbec, but I am not certain.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cOh, but Balbec is quite charming, I was down that way a few years ago. They are beginning to build some very pretty little-villas there; I think you\\u2019ll like the place. But may I ask what has made you choose Balbec?\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cMy son is very an ious to visit some of the churches in that neighbourhood, and Balbec church in particular. I was a little afraid that the tiring journey there, and the discomfort of staying in the place might be too much for him. But I hear that they have just opened an e cellent hotel, in which he will be able to get all the comfort that he requires.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cIndeed! I must make a note of that, for a certain person who will not turn up her nose at a comfortable hotel.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cThe church at Balbec is very beautiful, sir, is it not?\\u201d I inquired, repressing my sorrow at learning that one of the attractions of Balbec consisted in its pretty little villas  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cNo, it is not bad; but it cannot be compared for a moment with such positive jewels in stone as the Cathedrals of Rheims and Chartres, or with what is to my mind the pearl among them all, the Sainte-Chapelle here in Paris.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cBut, surely, Balbec church is partly romanesque, is it not?\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cWhy, yes, it is in the romanesque style, which is to say very cold and lifeless, with no hint in it anywhere of the grace, the fantasy of the later gothic builders, who worked their stone as if it had been so much lace. Balbec church is well worth a visit, if you are in those parts; it is decidedly quaint; on a wet day, when you have nothing better to do, you might look inside; you will see the tomb of Tourville.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cTell me, were you at the Foreign Ministry dinner last night?\\u201d asked my father. \\u201cI couldn\\u2019t go.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cNo,\\u201d M. de Norpois smiled, \\u201cI must confess that I renounced it for a party of a very different sort. I was dining with a lady whose name you may possibly have heard, the beautiful Mme. Swann.\\u201d My mother checked an impulsive movement, for, being more rapid in perception than my father, she used to alarm herself on his account over things which only began to upset him a moment later. Anything unpleasant that might occur to him was discovered first by her, just as bad news from France is always known abroad sooner than among ourselves. But she was curious to know what sort of people the Swanns managed to entertain, and so inquired of M. de Norpois as to whom he had met there  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cWhy, my dear lady, it is a house which or so it struck me is especially attractive to gentlemen. There were several married men there last night, but their wives were all, as it happened, unwell, and so had not come with them,\\u201d replied the Ambassador with a mordancy sheathed in good-humour, casting on each of us a glance the gentleness and discretion of which appeared to be tempering while in reality they deftly intensified its malice  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cIn all fairness,\\u201d he went on, \\u201cI must add that women do go to the house, but women who belong rather \\u2014 what shall I say \\u2014 to the Republican world than to Swann\\u2019s\\u201d he pronounced it \\u201cSvann\\u2019s\\u201d \\u201ccircle. Still, you can never tell. Perhaps it will turn into a political or a literary salon some day. Anyhow, they appear to be quite happy as they are. Indeed, I feel that Swann advertises his happiness just a trifle too blatantly. He told us the names of all the people who had asked him and his wife out for the ne t week, people with whom there was no particular reason to be proud of being intimate, with a want of reserve, of taste, almost of tact which I was astonished to remark in so refined a man. He kept on repeating, \\u2018We haven\\u2019t a free evening!\\u2019 as though that had been a thing to boast of, positively like a parvenu, and he is certainly not that. For Swann had always plenty of friends, women as well as men, and without seeming over-bold, without the least wish to appear indiscreet, I think I may safely say that not all of them, of course, nor even the majority of them, but one at least, who is a lady of the very highest rank, would perhaps not have shewn herself ine orably a from the idea of entering upon relations with Mme. Swann, in which case it is safe to assume that more than one sheep of the social flock would have followed her lead. But it seems that there has been no indication on Swann\\u2019s part of any movement in that direction  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cWhat do I see? A Nesselrode pudding! As well! I declare, I shall need a course at Carlsbad after such a Lucullus-feast as this  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cPossibly Swann felt that there would be too much resistance to overcome. The marriage \\u2014 so much is certain \\u2014 was not well received. There has been some talk of his wife\\u2019s having money, but that is all humbug. Anyhow, the whole affair has been looked upon with disfavour. And then, Swann has an aunt who is e cessively rich and in an admirable position socially, married to a man who, financially speaking, is a power. Not only has she refused to meet Mme. Swann, she has actually started a campaign to force her friends and acquaintances to do the same. I do not mean to say that anyone who moves in a good circle in Paris has shewn any actual incivility to Mme. Swann. . . . No! A hundred times no! Quite apart from her husband\\u2019s being eminently a man to take up the challenge. Anyhow, there is one curious thing about it, to see the immense importance that Swann, who knows so many and such e clusive people, attaches to a society of which the best that can be said is that it is e tremely mi ed. I myself, who knew him in the old days, must admit that I felt more astonished than amused at seeing a man so well-bred as he is, so much at home in the best houses, effusively thanking the Chief Secretary to the Minister of Posts for having come to them, and asking him whether Mme. Swann might take the liberty of calling upon his wife. He must feel something of an e ile, don\\u2019t you know; evidently, it\\u2019s quite a different world. I don\\u2019t think, all the same, that Swann is unhappy. It is true that for some years before the marriage she was always trying to blackmail him in a rather disgraceful way; she would take the child away whenever Swann refused her anything. Poor Swann, who is as unsophisticated as he is, for all that, sharp, believed every time that the child\\u2019s disappearance was a coincidence, and declined to face the facts. Apart from that, she made such continual scenes that everyone e pected that, from the day she attained her object and was safely married, nothing could possibly restrain her and that their life would be a hell on earth. Instead of which, just the opposite has happened. People are inclined to laugh at the way in which Swann speaks of his wife; it\\u2019s become a standing joke. Of course, one could hardly e pect that, conscious, more or less of being a \\u2014you remember Moli\\u00e8re\\u2019s line he would go and proclaim it urbi et orbi; still that does not prevent one from finding a tendency in him to e aggerate when he declares that she makes an e cellent wife. And yet that is not so far from the truth as people imagine. In her own way \\u2014 which is not, perhaps, what all husbands would prefer, but then, between you and me, I find it difficult to believe that Swann, who has known her for ever so long and is far from being an utter fool, did not know what to e pect \\u2014 there can be no denying that she does seem to have a certain regard for him. I do not say that she is not flighty, and Swann himself has no fault to find with her for that, if one is to believe the charitable tongues which, as you may suppose, continue to wag. But she is distinctly grateful to him for what he has done for her, and, despite the fears that were everywhere e pressed of the contrary, her temper seems to have become angelic.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 This alteration was perhaps not so e traordinary as M. de Norpois professed to find it. Odette had not believed that Swann would ever consent to marry her; each time that she made the suggestive announcement that some man about town had just married his mistress she had seen him stiffen into a glacial silence, or at the most, if she were directly to challenge him, asking: \\u201cDon\\u2019t you think it very nice, a very fine thing that he has done, for a woman who sacrificed all her youth to him?\\u201d had heard him answer dryly: \\u201cBut I don\\u2019t say that there\\u2019s anything wrong in it. Everyone does what he himself thinks right.\\u201d She came very near, indeed, to believing that as he used to threaten in moments of anger he was going to leave her altogether, for she had heard it said, not long since, by a woman sculptor, that \\u201cYou cannot be surprised at anything men do, they\\u2019re such brutes,\\u201d and impressed by the profundity of this ma im of pessimism she had appropriated it for herself, and repeated it on every possible occasion with an air of disappointment which seemed to imply: \\u201cAfter all, it\\u2019s not impossible in any way; it would be just my luck.\\u201d Meanwhile all the virtue had gone from the optimistic ma im which had hitherto guided Odette through life: \\u201cYou can do anything with men when they\\u2019re in love with you, they\\u2019re such idiots!\\u201d a doctrine which was e pressed on her face by the same tremor of an eyelid that might have accompanied such words as: \\u201cDon\\u2019t be frightened; he won\\u2019t break anything.\\u201d While she waited, Odette was tormented by the thought of what one of her friends, who had been married by a man who had not lived with her for nearly so long as Odette herself had lived with Swann, and had had no child by him, and who was now in a definitely respectable position, invited to the balls at the Elys\\u00e9e and so forth, must think of Swann\\u2019s behaviour. A consultant more discerning than M. de Norpois would doubtless have been able to diagnose that it was this feeling of shame and humiliation that had embittered Odette, that the devilish characteristics which she displayed were no essential part of her, no irremediable evil, and so would easily have foretold what had indeed come to pass, namely that a new rule of life, the matrimonial, would put an end, with almost magic swiftness, to these painful incidents, of daily occurrence but in no sense organic. Practically everyone was surprised at the marriage, and this, in itself, is surprising. No doubt very few people understand the purely subjective nature of the phenomenon that we call love, or how it creates, so to speak, a fresh, a third, a supplementary person, distinct from the person whom the world knows by the same name, a person most of whose constituent elements are derived from ourself, the lover. And so there are very few who can regard as natural the enormous proportions that a creature comes to assume in our eyes who is not the same as the creature that they see. It would appear, none the less, that so far as Odette was concerned people might have taken into account the fact that if, indeed, she had never entirely understood Swann\\u2019s mentality, at least she was acquainted with the titles, and with all the details of his studies, so much so that the name of Vermeer was as familiar to her as that of her own dressmaker; while as for Swann himself she knew intimately those traits of character of which the rest of the world must remain ignorant or merely laugh at them, and only a mistress or a sister may gain possession of the revealing, cherished image; and so strongly are we attached to such eccentricities, even to those of them which we are most an ious to correct, that it is because a woman comes in time to acquire an indulgent, an affectionately mocking familiarity, such as we ourselves have with them, or our relatives have, that amours of long standing have something of the sweetness and strength of family affection. The bonds that unite us to another creature receive their consecration when that creature adopts the same point of view as ourself in judging one of our imperfections. And among these special traits there were others, besides, which belonged as much to his intellect as to his character, which, all the same, because they had their roots in the latter, Odette had been able more easily to discern. She complained that when Swann turned author, when he published his essays, these characteristics were not to be found in them as they were in his letters, or in his conversation, where they abounded. She urged him to give them a more prominent place. She would have liked that because it was these things that she herself preferred in him, but since she preferred them because they were the things most typical of himself, she was perhaps not wrong in wishing that they might be found in his writings. Perhaps also she thought that his work, if endowed with more vitality, so that it ultimately brought him success, might enable her also to form what at the Verdurins\\u2019 she had been taught to value above everything else in the world \\u2014 a salon  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Among the people to whom this sort of marriage appeared ridiculous, people who in their own case would ask themselves, \\u201cWhat will M. de Guermantes think, what will Br\\u00e9aut\\u00e9 say when I marry Mlle, de Montmorency?\\u201d, among the people who cherished that sort of social ideal would have figured, twenty years earlier, Swann himself, the Swarm who had taken endless pains to get himself elected to the Jockey Club, and had reckoned at that time on making a brilliant marriage which, by consolidating his position, would have made him one of the most conspicuous figures in Paris. Only, the visions which a marriage like that suggests to the mind of the interested party need, like all visions, if they are not to fade away and be altogether lost, to receive sustenance from without. Your most ardent longing is to humiliate the man who has insulted you. But if you never hear of him again, having removed to some other place, your enemy will come to have no longer the slightest importance for you. If one has lost sight for a score of years of all the people on whose account one would have liked to be elected to the Jockey Club or the Institute, the prospect of becoming a member of one or other of those corporations will have ceased to tempt one. Now fully as much as retirement, ill-health or religious conversion, protracted relations with a woman will substitute fresh visions for the old. There was not on Swann\\u2019s part, when he married Odette, any renunciation of his social ambitions, for from these ambitions Odette had long ago, in the spiritual sense of the word, detached him. Besides, had he not been so detached, his marriage would have been all the more creditable. It is because they imply the sacrifice of a more or less advantageous position to a purely private happiness that, as a general rule, \\u2018impossible\\u2019 marriages are the happiest of all. One cannot very well include among the \\u2018impossible\\u2019 marriages those that are made for money, there being no instance on record of a couple, of whom the wife or even the husband has thus sold himself, who have not sooner or later been admitted into society, if only by tradition, and on the strength of so many precedents, and so as not to have two conflicting standards. Perhaps, on the other hand, the artistic, if not the per side of Swann\\u2019s nature would in any event have derived a certain amount of pleasure from coupling with himself, in one of those crossings of species such as Mendelians practise and mythology records, a creature of a different race, archduchess or prostitute, from contracting a royal alliance or from marrying beneath him. There had been but one person in all the world whose opinion he took into consideration whenever he thought of his possible marriage with Odette; that was, and from no snobbish motive, the Duchesse de Guermantes. With whom Odette, on the contrary, was but little concerned, thinking only of those people whose position was immediately above her own, rather than in so vague an empyrean. But when Swann in his daydreams saw Odette as already his wife he invariably formed a picture of the moment in which he would take her \\u2014 her, and above all her daughter \\u2014 to call upon the Princesse des Laumes who was shortly, on the death of her father-in-law, to become Duchesse de Guermantes. He had no desire to  duce them anywhere else, but his heart would soften as he invented \\u2014 uttering their actual words to himself \\u2014 all the things that the Duchess would say of him to Odette, and Odette to the Duchess, the affection that she would shew for Gilberte, spoiling her, making him proud of his child. He enacted to himself the scene of this  duction with the same precision in each of its imaginary details that people shew when they consider how they would spend, supposing they were to win it, a lottery prize the amount of which they have arbitrarily determined. In so far as a mental picture which accompanies one of our resolutions may be said to be its motive, so it might be said that if Swann married Odette it was in order to present her and Gilberte, without anyone\\u2019s else being present, without, if need be, anyone\\u2019s else ever coming to know of it, to the Duchesse de Guermantes. We shall see how this sole social ambition that he had entertained for his wife and daughter was precisely that one the realisation of which proved to be forbidden him by a veto so absolute that Swann died in the belief that the Duchess would never possibly come to know them. We shall see also that, on the contrary, the Duchesse de Guermantes did associate with Odette and Gilberte after the death of Swann. And doubtless he would have been wiser \\u2014 seeing that he could attach so much importance to so small a matter \\u2014 not to have formed too dark a picture of tie future, in this conne ion, but to have consoled himself with the hope that the meeting of the ladies might indeed take place when he was no longer there to enjoy it. The laborious process of causation which sooner or later will bring about every possible effect, including consequently those which one had believed to be most nearly impossible, naturally slow at times, is rendered slower still by our impatience which in seeking to accelerate only obstructs it and by our very e istence, and comes to fruition only when we have ceased to desire it \\u2014 have ceased, possibly, to live. Was not Swann conscious of this from his own e perience, had there not been already, in his life, as it were a pr\\u00e9figuration of what was to happen after his death, a posthumous happiness in this marriage with this Odette whom he had passionately loved \\u2014 even if she had not been pleasing to him at first sight \\u2014 whom he had married when he no longer loved her, when the creature that, in Swann, had so longed to live, had so despaired of living all its life in company with Odette, when that creature was e tinct?  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 I began ne t to speak of the Comte de Paris, to ask whether he was not one of Swann\\u2019s friends, for I was afraid lest the conversation should drift away from him. \\u201cWhy, yes!\\u201d replied M. de Norpois, turning towards me and fi ing upon my modest person the azure gaze in which floated, as in their vital element, his immense capacity for work and his power of assimilation. And \\u201cUpon my word,\\u201d he added, once more addressing my father, \\u201cI do not think that I shall be overstepping the bounds of the respect which I have always professed for the Prince although without, you understand, maintaining any personal relations with him, which would inevitably compromise my position, unofficial as that may be, if I tell you of a little episode which is not without point; no more than four years ago, at a small railway station in one of the countries of Central Europe, the Prince happened to set eyes on Mme. Swann. Naturally, none of his circle ventured to ask his Royal Highness what he thought of her. That would not have been seemly. But when her name came up by chance in conversation, by certain signs \\u2014 imperceptible, if you like, but quite unmistakable \\u2014 the Prince appeared willing enough to let it be understood that his impression of her had, in a word, been far from unfavourable.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cBut there could have been no possibility, surely, of her being presented to the Comte de Paris?\\u201d inquired my father  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cWell, we don\\u2019t know; with Princes one never does know,\\u201d replied M. de Norpois. \\u201cThe most e alted, those who know best how to secure what is due to them, are as often as not the last to let themselves be embarrassed by the decrees of popular opinion, even by those for which there is most justification, especially when it is a question of their rewarding a personal attachment to themselves. Now it is certain that the Comte de Paris has always most graciously recognised the devotion of Swann, who is, for that matter, a man of character, in spite of it all.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cAnd what was your own impression, your E cellency? Do tell us!\\u201d my mother asked, from politeness as well as from curiosity  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 All the energy of the old connoisseur broke through the habitual moderation of his speech as he answered: \\u201cQuite e cellent!\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 And knowing that the admission that a strong impression has been made on one by a woman takes its place, provided that one makes it in a playful tone, in a certain category of the art of conversation that is highly appreciated, he broke into a little laugh that lasted for several seconds, moistening the old diplomat\\u2019s blue eyes and making his nostrils, with their network of tiny scarlet veins, quiver. \\u201cShe is altogether charming!\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cWas there a writer of the name of Bergotte at this dinner, sir?\\u201d I asked timidly, still trying to keep the conversation to the subject of the Swanns  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cYes, Bergotte was there,\\u201d replied M. de Norpois, inclining his head courteously towards me, as though in his desire to be pleasant to my father he attached to everything connected with him a real importance, even to the questions of a boy of my age who was not accustomed to see such politeness shewn to him by persons of his. \\u201cDo you know him?\\u201d he went on, fastening on me that clear gaze, the penetration of which had won the praise of Bismarck  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cMy son does not know him, but he admires his work immensely,\\u201d my mother e plained  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cGood heavens!\\u201d e claimed M. de Norpois, inspiring me with doubts of my own intelligence far more serious than those that ordinarily distracted me, when I saw that what I valued a thousand thousand times more than myself, what I regarded as the most e alted thing in the world, was for him at the very foot of the scale of admiration. \\u201cI do not share your son\\u2019s point of view. Bergotte is what I call a flute-player: one must admit that he plays on it very agreeably, although with a great deal of mannerism, of affectation. But when all is said, it is no more than that, and that is nothing very great. Nowhere does one find in his enervated writings anything that could be called construction. No action \\u2014 or very little \\u2014 but above all no range. His books fail at the foundation, or rather they have no foundation at all. At a time like the present, when the ever-increasing comple ity of life leaves one scarcely a moment for reading, when the map of Europe has undergone radical alterations, and is on the eve, very probably, of undergoing others more drastic still, when so many new and threatening problems are arising on every side, you will allow me to suggest that one is entitled to ask that a writer should be something else than a fine intellect which makes us forget, amid otiose and byzantine discussions of the merits of pure form, that we may be overwhelmed at any moment by a double tide of barbarians, those from without and those from within our borders. I am aware that this is a blasphemy against the sacrosanct school of what these gentlemen term \\u2018Art for Art\\u2019s sake,\\u2019 but at this period of history there are tasks more urgent than the manipulation of words in a harmonious manner. Not that Bergotte\\u2019s manner is not now and then quite attractive. I have no fault to find with that, but taken as a whole, it is all very precious, very thin, and has very little virility. I can now understand more easily, when I bear in mind your altogether e cessive regard for Bergotte, the few lines that you shewed me just now, which it would have been unfair to you not to overlook, since you yourself told me, in all simplicity, that they were merely a childish scribbling.\\u201d I had, indeed, said so, but I did not think anything of the sort. \\u201cFor every sin there is forgiveness, and especially for the sins of youth. After all, others as well as yourself have such sins upon their conscience, and you are not the only one who has believed himself to be a poet in his day. But one can see in what you have shewn me the evil influence of Bergotte. You will not, of course, be surprised when I say that there was in it none of his good qualities, since he is a past-master in the art \\u2014 incidentally quite superficial \\u2014 of handling a certain style of which, at your age, you cannot have acquired even the rudiments. But already there is the same fault, that parado  of stringing together fine-sounding words and only afterwards troubling about what they mean. That is putting the cart before the horse, even in Bergotte\\u2019s books. All those Chinese puzzles of form, all these deliquescent mandarin subtleties seem to me to be quite futile. Given a few fireworks, let off prettily enough by an author, and up goes the shout of genius. Works of genius are not so common as all that! Bergotte cannot place to his credit \\u2014 does not carry in his baggage, if I may use the e pression \\u2014 a single novel that is at all lofty in its conception, any of those books which one keeps in a special corner of one\\u2019s library. I do not discover one such in the whole of his work. But that does not e clude the fact that, with him, the work is infinitely superior to the author. Ah! there is a man who justifies the wit who insisted that one ought never to know an author e cept through his books. It would be impossible to imagine an individual who corresponded less to his \\u2014 more pretentious, more pompous, less fitted for human society. Vulgar at some moments, at others talking like a book, and not even like one of his own, but like a boring book, which his, to do them justice, are not \\u2014 such is your Bergotte. He has the most confused mind, alembicated, what our ancestors called a diseur de ph\\u00e9bus, and he makes the things that he says even more unpleasant by the manner in which he says them. I forget for the moment whether it is Lom\\u00e9nie or Sainte-Beuve who tells us that Vigny repelled people by the same eccentricity. But Bergotte has never given us a Cinq-Mars, or a Cachet Rouge, certain pages of which are regular anthology pieces.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Paralysed by what M. de Norpois had just said to me with regard to the fragment which I had submitted to him, and remembering at the same time the difficulties that I e perienced when I attempted to write an essay or merely to devote myself to serious thought, I felt conscious once again of my intellectual nullity and that I was not born for a literary life. Doubtless in the old days at Combray certain impressions of a very humble order, or a few pages of Bergotte used to plunge me into a state of musing which had appeared to me to be of great value. But this state was what my poem in prose reflected; there could be no doubt that M. de Norpois had at once grasped and had seen through the fallacy of what I had discovered to be beautiful simply by a mirage that must be entirely false since the Ambassador had not been taken in by it. He had shewn me, on the other hand, what an infinitely unimportant place was mine when I was judged from outside, objectively, by the best-disposed and most intelligent of e perts. I felt myself to be struck speechless, overwhelmed; and my mind, like a fluid which is without dimensions save those of the vessel that is provided for it, just as it had been e panded a moment ago so as to fill all the vast capacity of genius, contracted now, was entirely contained in the straitened mediocrity in which M. de Norpois had of a sudden enclosed and sealed it  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cOur first  duction \\u2014 I speak of Bergotte and myself \\u2014\\u2014\\u201d he resumed, turning to my father, \\u201cwas somewhat beset with thorns which is, after all, only another way of saying that it was not lacking in points. Bergotte \\u2014 some years ago, now \\u2014 paid a visit to Vienna while I was Ambassador there; he was presented to me by the Princess Metternich, came and wrote his name, and e pected to be asked to the Embassy. Now, being in a foreign country as the Representative of France, to which he has after all done some honour by his writings, to a certain e tent let us say, to be quite accurate, to a very slight e tent, I was prepared to set aside the unfavourable opinion that I hold of his private life. But he was not travelling alone, and he actually let it be understood that he was not to be invited without his companion. I trust that I am no more of a prude than most men, and, being a bachelor, I was perhaps in a position to throw open the doors of the Embassy a little wider than if I had been married and the father of a family. Nevertheless, I must admit that there are depths of degradation to which I should hesitate to descend, while these are rendered more repulsive still by the tone, not moral, merely \\u2014 let us be quite frank and say moralising \\u2014 that Bergotte takes up in his books, where one finds nothing but perpetual and, between ourselves, somewhat wearisome analyses, torturing scruples, morbid remorse, and all for the merest peccadilloes, the most trivial naughtinesses as one knows from one\\u2019s own e perience, while all the time he is shewing such an utter lack of conscience and so much cynicism in his private life. To cut a long story short, I evaded the responsibility, the Princess returned to the charge, but without success. So that I do not suppose that I appear e actly in the odour of sanctity to the gentleman, and I am not sure how far he appreciated Swann\\u2019s kindness in inviting him and myself on the same evening. Unless of course it was he who asked for the invitation. One can never tell, for really he is not normal. Indeed that is his sole e cuse.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cAnd was Mme. Swann\\u2019s daughter at the dinner?\\u201d I asked M. de Norpois, taking advantage, to put this question, of a moment in which, as we all moved towards the drawing-room, I could more easily conceal my emotion than would have been possible at table, where I was held fast in the glare of the lamplight  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 M. de Norpois appeared to be trying for a moment to remember; then: \\u201cYes, you mean a young person of fourteen or fifteen? Yes, of course, I remember now that she was  duced to me before dinner as the daughter of our Amphitryon. I may tell you that I saw but little of her; she retired to bed early. Or else she went out to see a friend \\u2014 I forget. But I can see that you are very intimate with the Swann household.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cI play with Mlle. Swann in the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es, and she is delightful.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cOh! so that is it, is it? But I assure you, I thought her charming. I must confess to you, however, that I do not believe that she will ever be anything like her mother, if I may say as much without wounding you in a vital spot.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cI prefer Mlle. Swann\\u2019s face, but I admire her mother, too, enormously; I go for walks in the Bois simply in the hope of seeing her pass.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cAh! But I must tell them that; they will be highly flattered.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 While he was uttering these words, and for a few seconds after he had uttered them, M. de Norpois was still in the same position as anyone else who, hearing me speak of Swann as an intelligent man, of his family as respectable stockbrokers, of his house as a fine house, imagined that I would speak just as readily of another man equally intelligent, of other stockbrokers equally respectable, of another house equally fine; it was the moment in which a sane man who is talking to a lunatic has not yet perceived that his companion is mad. M. de Norpois knew that there was nothing unnatural in the pleasure which one derived from looking at pretty women, that it was a social convention, when anyone spoke to you of a pretty woman with any fervour, to pretend to think that he was in love with her, and to promise to further his designs. But in saying that he would speak of me to Gilberte and her mother which would enable me, like an Olympian deity who has taken on the fluidity of a breath of wind, or rather the aspect of the old greybeard whose form Minerva borrows, to penetrate, myself, unseen, into Mme. Swann\\u2019s drawing-room, to attract her attention, to occupy her thoughts, to arouse her gratitude for my admiration, to appear before her as the friend of an important person, to seem to her worthy to be invited by her in the future and to enter into the intimate life of her family, this important person who was going to make use, in my interests, of the great influence which he must have with Mme. Swann inspired in me suddenly an affection so compelling that I had difficulty in restraining myself from kissing his gentle hands, white and crumpled, which looked as though they had been left lying too long in water. I even sketched in the air an outline of that impulsive movement, but this I supposed that I alone had observed. For it is difficult for any of us to calculate e actly on what scale his words or his gestures are apparent to others. Partly from the fear of e aggerating our own importance, and also because we enlarge to enormous proportions the field over which the impressions formed by other people in the course of their lives are obliged to e tend, we imagine that the accessories of our speech and attitudes scarcely penetrate the consciousness, still less remain in the memory of those with whom we converse, It is, we may suppose, to a prompting of this sort that criminals yield when they \\u2018touch up\\u2019 the wording of a statement already made, thinking that the new variant cannot be confronted with any e isting version. But it is quite possible that, even in what concerns the millennial e istence of the human race, the philosophy of the journalist, according to which everything is destined to oblivion, is less true than a contrary philosophy which would predict the conservation of everything. In the same newspaper in which the moralist of the \\u2018Paris column\\u2019 says to us of an event, of a work of art, all the more forcibly of a singer who has enjoyed her \\u2018crowded hour\\u2019: \\u201cWho will remember this in ten years\\u2019 time?\\u201d overleaf does not the report of the Acad\\u00e9mie des Inscriptions speak often of a fact, in itself of smaller importance, of a poem of little merit, which dates from the epoch of the Pharaohs and is now known again in its entirety? Is it not, perhaps, just the same in our brief life on earth? And yet, some years later, in a house in which M. de Norpois, who was also calling there, had seemed to me the most solid support that I could hope to find, because he was the friend of my father, indulgent, inclined to wish us all well, and besides, by his profession and upbringing, trained to discretion, when, after the Ambassador had gone, I was told that he had alluded to an evening long ago when he had seen the moment in which I was just going to kiss his hands, not only did I colour up to the roots of my hair but I was stupefied to learn how different from all that I had believed were not only the manner in which M. de Norpois spoke of me but also the constituents of his memory: this tittle-tattle enlightened me as to the incalculable proportions of absence and presence of mind, of recollection and forgetfulness which go to form the human intelligence; and I was as marvellously surprised as on the day on which I read for the first time, in one of Maspero\\u2019s books, that we had an e act list of the sportsmen whom Assurbanipal used to invite to his hunts, a thousand years before the Birth of Christ  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cOh, sir,\\u201d I assured M. de Norpois, when he told me that he would inform Gilberte and her mother how much I admired them, \\u201cif you would do that, if you would speak of me to Mme. Swann, my whole life would not be long enough for me to prove my gratitude, and that life would be all at your service. But I feel bound to point out to you that I do not know Mme. Swann, and that I have never been  duced to her.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 I had added these last words from a scruple of conscience, and so as not to appear to be boasting of an acquaintance which I did not possess. But while I was uttering them I felt that they were already superfluous, for from the beginning of my speech of thanks, with its chilling ardour, I had seen flitting across the face of the Ambassador an e pression of hesitation and dissatisfaction, and in his eyes that vertical, narrow, slanting look like, in the drawing of a solid body in perspective, the receding line of one of its surfaces, that look which one addresses to the invisible audience whom one has within oneself at the moment when one is saying something that one\\u2019s other audience, the person whom one has been addressing \\u2014 myself, in this instance \\u2014 is not meant to hear. I realised in a flash that these phrases which I had pronounced, which, feeble as they were when measured against the flood of gratitude that was coursing through me, had seemed to me bound to touch M. de Norpois and to confirm his decision upon an intervention which would have given him so little trouble and me so much joy, were perhaps out of all those that could have been chosen, with diabolical malice, by persons an ious to do me harm the only ones that could result in making him abandon his intention. Indeed, when he heard me speak, just as at the moment when a stranger with whom we have been e changing \\u2014 quite pleasantly \\u2014 our impressions, which we might suppose to be similar to his, of the passers-by, whom we have agreed in regarding as vulgar, reveals suddenly the pathological abyss that divides him from us by adding carelessly, as he runs his hand over his pocket: \\u201cWhat a pity, I haven\\u2019t got my revolver here; I could have picked off the lot!\\u201d M. de Norpois, who knew that nothing was less costly or more easy than to be commended to Mme. Swann and taken to her house, and saw that to me, on the contrary, such favours bore so high a price and were consequently, no doubt, of great difficulty, thought that the desire, apparently normal, which I had e pressed must cloak some different thought, some suspect intention, some pre-e istent fault, on account of which, in the certainty of displeasing Mme. Swann, no one hitherto had been willing to undertake the responsibility for conveying a message to her from me. And I understood that this office was one which he would never discharge, that he might see Mme. Swann daily, for years to come, without ever mentioning my name. He did indeed ask her, a few days later, for some information which I required, and charged my father to convey it to me. But he had not thought it his duty to tell her at whose instance he was inquiring. So she would never discover that I knew M. de Norpois and that I hoped so greatly to be asked to her house; and this was perhaps a less misfortune than I supposed. For the second of these discoveries would probably not have added much to the efficacy, in any event uncertain, of the first. In Odette the idea of her own life and of her home awakened no mysterious disturbance; a person who knew her, who came to see her, did not seem to her a fabulous creature such as he seemed to me who would have flung a stone through Swann\\u2019s windows if I could have written upon it that I knew M. de Norpois; I was convinced that such a message, even when transmitted in so brutal a fashion, would have done far more to e alt me in the eyes of the lady of the house than it would have prejudiced her against me. But even if I had been capable of understanding that the mission which M. de Norpois did not perform must have remained futile, nay, more than that, might even have damaged my credit with the Swanns, I should not have had the courage, had he shewn himself consenting, to release the Ambassador from it, and to renounce the pleasure \\u2014 however fatal its consequences might prove \\u2014 of feeling that my name and my person were thus brought for a moment into Gilberte\\u2019s presence, in her unknown life and home  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 After M. de Norpois had gone my father cast an eye over the evening paper; I dreamed once more of Berma. The pleasure which I had found in listening to her required to be made complete, all the more because it had fallen far short of what I had promised myself; and so it at once assimilated everything that was capable of giving it nourishment, those merits, for uir stance, which M. de Norpois had admitted that Berma possessed, and which my mind had absorbed at one draught, like a dry lawn when water is poured on it. Then my father handed me the newspaper, pointing me out a paragraph which ran more or less as follows:\\u2014-  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 The performance of Ph\\u00e8dre, given this afternoon before an enthusiastic audience, which included the foremost representatives of society and the arts, as well as the principal critics, was for Mme. Berma, who played the heroine, the occasion of a triumph as brilliant as any that she has known in the course of her phenomenal career. We shall discuss more fully in a later issue this performance, which is indeed an event in the history of the stage; for the present we need only add that the best qualified judges are unanimous in the pronouncement that such an interpretation sheds an entirely new light on the part of Ph\\u00e8dre, which is one of the finest and most studied of Racine\\u2019s creations, and that it constitutes the purest and most e alted manifestation of dramatic art which it has been the privilege of our generation to witness  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Immediately my mind had conceived this new idea of \\u201cthe purest and most e alted manifestation of dramatic art,\\u201d it, the idea, sped to join the imperfect pleasure which I had felt in the theatre, added to it a little of what was lacking, and their combination formed something so e alting that I cried out within myself: \\u201cWhat a great artist!\\u201d It may doubtless be argued that I was not absolutely sincere. But let us bear in mind, rather, the numberless writers who, dissatisfied with the page which they have just written, if they read some eulogy of the genius of Chateaubriand, or evoke the spirit of some great artist whose equal they aspire to be, by humming to themselves, for instance, a phrase of Beethoven, the melancholy of which they compare with what they have been trying to e press in prose, are so filled with that idea of genius that they add it to their own productions, when they think of them once again, see them no longer in the light in which at first they appeared, and, hazarding an act of faith in the value of their work, say to themselves: \\u201cAfter all!\\u201d without taking into account that, into the total which determines their ultimate satisfaction, they have  duced the memory of marvellous pages of Chateaubriand which they assimilate to their own, but of which, in cold fact, they are not the authors; let us bear in mind the numberless men who believe in the love of a mistress on the evidence only of her betrayals; all those, too, who are sustained by the alternative hopes, either of an incomprehensible survival of death, when they think, inconsolable husbands, of the wives whom they have lost but have not ceased to love, or, artists, of the posthumous glory which they may thus enjoy; or else the hope of complete e tinction which comforts them when their thoughts turn to the misdeeds that otherwise they must e piate after death; let us bear in mind also the travellers who come home enraptured by the general beauty of a tour of which, from day to day, they have felt nothing but the tedious incidents; and let us then declare whether, in the communal life that is led by our ideas in the enclosure of our minds, there is a single one of those that make us most happy which has not first sought, a very parasite, and won from an alien but neighbouring idea the greater part of the strength that it originally lacked  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 My mother appeared none too well pleased that my father no longer thought of \\u2018the career\\u2019 for myself. I fancy that, an ious before all things that a definite rule of life should discipline the eccentricity of my nervous system, what she regretted was not so much seeing me abandon diplomacy as the prospect of my devoting myself to literature. But \\u201cLet him alone!\\u201d my father protested; \\u201cthe main thing is that a man should find pleasure in his work. He is no longer a child. He knows pretty well now what he likes, it is not at all probable that he will change, and he is quite capable of deciding for himself what will make him happy in life.\\u201d That evening, as I waited for the time to arrive when, thanks to the freedom of choice which they allowed me, I should or should not begin to be happy in life, my father\\u2019s words caused me great uneasiness. At all times his une pected kindnesses had, when they were manifested, prompted in me so keen a desire to kiss, above where his beard began, his glowing cheeks, that if I did not yield to that desire, it was simply because I was afraid of annoying him. And on that day, as an author becomes alarmed when he sees the fruits of his own meditation, which do not appear to him to be of great value since he does not separate them from himself, oblige a publisher to choose a kind of paper, to employ a fount of type finer, perhaps, than they deserve, I asked myself whether my desire to write was of sufficient importance to justify my father in dispensing so much generosity. But apart from that, when he spoke of my inclinations as no longer liable to change, he awakened in me two terrible suspicions. The first was that at a time when, every day, I regarded myself as standing upon the threshold of a life which was still intact and would not enter upon its course until the following morning my e istence was already begun, and that, furthermore, what was yet to follow would not differ to any e tent from what had already elapsed. The second suspicion, which was nothing more, really, than a variant of the first, was that I was not situated somewhere outside the realm of Time, but was subject to its laws, just like the people in novels who, for that reason, used to plunge me in such depression when I read of their lives, down at Combray, in the fastness of my wicker sentry-bo . In theory one is aware that the earth revolves, but in practice one does not perceive it, the ground upon which one treads seems not to move, and one can live undisturbed. So it is with Time in one\\u2019s life. And to make its flight perceptible novelists are obliged, by wildly accelerating the beat of the pendulum, to transport the reader in a couple of minutes over ten, or twenty, or even thirty years. At the top of one page we have left a lover full of hope; at the foot of the ne t we meet him again, a bowed old man of eighty, painfully dragging himself on his daily walk about the courtyard of an almshouse, scarcely replying to what is said to him, oblivious of the past. In saying of me, \\u201cHe is no longer a child,\\u201d \\u201cHis tastes will not change now,\\u201d and so forth, my father had suddenly made me apparent to myself in my position in Time, and caused me the same kind of depression as if I had baen, not yet the enfeebled old pensioner, but one of those heroes of whom the author, in a tone of indifference which is particularly galling, says to us at the end of a book: \\u201cHe very seldom comes up now from the country. He has finally decided to end his days there.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Meanwhile my father, so as to forestall any criticism that we might feel tempted to make of our guest, said to my mother: \\u201cUpon my word, old Norpois was rather \\u2018typical,\\u2019 as you call it, this evening, wasn\\u2019t he? When he said that it would not have been \\u2018seemly\\u2019 to ask the Comte de Paris a question, I was quite afraid you would burst out laughing.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cNot at all!\\u201d answered my mother. \\u201cI was delighted to see a man of his standing, and age too, keep that sort of simplicity, which is really a sign of straightforwardness and good-breeding.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cI should think so, indeed! That does not prevent his having a shrewd and discerning mind; I know him well, I see him at the Commission, remember, where he is very different from what he was here,\\u201d e claimed my father, who was glad to see that Mamma appreciated M. de Norpois, and an ious to persucde her that he was even superior to what she supposed, because a cordial nature e aggerates a friend\\u2019s qualities with as much pleasure as a mischievous one finds in depreciating them. \\u201cWhat was it that he said, again \\u2014\\u2018With Princes one never does know.\\u2019 . . .?\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cYes, that was it. I noticed it at the time; it was very neat. You can see that he has a vast e perience of life.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cThe astonishing thing is that he should have been dining with the Swanns, and that he seems to have found quite respectable people there, officials even. How on earth can Mme. Swann have managed to catch them?\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cDid you notice the malicious way he said: \\u2018It is a house which is especially attractive to gentlemen!\\u2019?\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 And each of them attempted to reproduce the manner in which M. de Norpois had uttered these words, as they might have attempted to capture some intonation of Bressant\\u2019s voice or of Thiron\\u2019s in L\\u2019Aventuri\\u00e8re or in theGendre de M. Poirier. But of all his sayings there was none so keenly relished as one was by Fran\\u00e7oise, who, years afterwards, even, could not \\u2018keep a straight face\\u2019 if we reminded her that she had been qualified by the Ambassador as \\u2018a chef of the first order,\\u2019 a compliment which my mother had gone in person to transmit to her, as a War Minister publishes the congratulations addressed to him by a visiting Sovereign after the grand review. I, as it happened, had preceded my mother to the kitchen. For I had e torted from Fran\\u00e7oise, who though opposed to war was cruel, that she would cause no undue suffering to the rabbit which she had to kill, and I had had no report yet of its death. Fran\\u00e7oise assured me that it had passed away as peacefully as could be desired, and very swiftly. \\u201cI have never seen a beast like it; it died without uttering a word; you would have thought it was dumb.\\u201d Being but little versed in the language of beasts I suggested that the rabbit had not, perhaps, a cry like the chicken\\u2019s. \\u201cJust wait till you see,\\u201d said Fran\\u00e7oise, filled with contempt for my ignorance, \\u201cif rabbits don\\u2019t cry every bit as much as chickens. Why, they are far noisier.\\u201d She received the compliments of M. de Norpois with the proud simplicity, the joyful and if but for the moment intelligent e pression of an artist when someone speaks to him of his art. My mother had sent her when she first came to us to several of the big restaurants to see how the cooking there was done. I had the same pleasure, that evening, in hearing her dismiss the most famous of them as mere cookshops that I had had long ago, when I learned with regard to theatrical artists that the hierarchy of their merits did not at all correspond to that of their reputations. \\u201cThe Ambassador,\\u201d my mother told her, \\u201cassured me that he knows no place where he can get cold beef and souffl\\u00e9s as good as yours.\\u201d Fran\\u00e7oise, with an air of modesty and of paying just homage to the truth, agreed, but seemed not at all impressed by the title \\u2018Ambassador\\u2019; she said of M. de Norpois, with the friendliness due to a man who had taken her for a chef: \\u201cHe\\u2019s a good old soul, like me.\\u201d She had indeed hoped to catch sight of him as he arrived, but knowing that Mamma hated their standing about behind doors and in windows, and thinking that Mamma would get to know from the other servants or from the porter that she had been keeping watch for Fran\\u00e7oise saw everywhere nothing but \\u2018jealousies\\u2019 and \\u2018tale-bearings,\\u2019 which played the same grim and unending part in her imagination as do for others of us the intrigues of the Jesuits or the Jews, she had contented herself with a peep from the kitchen window, \\u2018so as not to have words with Madame,\\u2019 and beneath the momentary aspect of M. de Norpois had \\u2018thought it was Monsieur Legrand,\\u2019 because of what she called his \\u2018agelity\\u2019 and in spite of their having not a single point in common. \\u201cWell,\\u201d inquired my mother, \\u201cand how do you e plain that nobody else can make a jelly as well as you \\u2014 when you choose?\\u201d \\u201cI really couldn\\u2019t say how that becomes about,\\u201d replied Fran\\u00e7oise, who had established no very clear line of demarcation between the verb \\u2018to come,\\u2019 in certain of its meanings at least, and the verb \\u2018to become.\\u2019 She was speaking the truth, if not the whole truth, being scarcely more capable \\u2014 or desirous \\u2014 of revealing the mystery which ensured the superiority of her jellies or her creams than a leader of fashion the secrets of her toilet or a great singer those of her song. Their e planations tell us little; it was the same with the recipes furnished by our cook. \\u201cThey do it in too much of a hurry,\\u201d she went on, alluding to the great restaurants, \\u201cand then it\\u2019s not all done together. You want the beef to become like a sponge, then it will drink up all the juice to the last drop. Still, there was one of those Caf\\u00e9s where I thought they did know a little bit about cooking. I don\\u2019t say it was altogether my jelly, but it was very nicely done, and the souffl\\u00e9s had plenty of cream.\\u201d \\u201cDo you mean Henry\\u2019s?\\u201d asked my father who had now joined us, for he greatly enjoyed that restaurant in the Place Gaillon where he went regularly to club dinners. \\u201cOh, dear no!\\u201d said Fran\\u00e7oise, with a mildness which cloaked her profound contempt. \\u201cI meant a little restaurant. At that Henry\\u2019s it\\u2019s all very good, sure enough, but it\\u2019s not a restaurant, it\\u2019s more like a \\u2014 soup-kitchen.\\u201d \\u201cWeber\\u2019s, then?\\u201d \\u201cOh, no, sir, I meant a good restaurant. Weber\\u2019s, that\\u2019s in the Rue Royale; that\\u2019s not a restaurant, it\\u2019s a drinking-shop. I don\\u2019t know that the food they give you there is even served. I think they don\\u2019t have any tablecloths; they just shove it down in front of you like that, with a take it or leave it.\\u201d \\u201cGiro\\u2019s?\\u201d \\u201cOh! there I should say they have the cooking done by ladies of the world.\\u201d \\u2018World\\u2019 meant for Fran\\u00e7oise the under-world. \\u201cLord! They need that to fetch the boys in.\\u201d We could see that, with all her air of simplicity, Fran\\u00e7oise was for the celebrities of her profession a more disastrous \\u2018comrade\\u2019 than the most jealous, the most infatuated of actresses. We felt, all the same, that she had a proper feeling for her art and a respect for tradition; for she went on: \\u201cNo, I mean a restaurant where they looked as if they kept a very good little family table. It\\u2019s a place of some consequence, too. Plenty of custom there. Oh, they raked in the coppers there, all right.\\u201d Fran\\u00e7oise, being an economist, reckoned in coppers, where your plunger would reckon in gold. \\u201cMadame knows the place well enough, down there to the right along the main boulevards, a little way back.\\u201d The restaurant of which she spoke with this blend of pride and good-humoured tolerance was, it turned out, the Caf\\u00e9 Anglais  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 When New Year\\u2019s Day came, I first of all paid a round of family visits with Mamma who, so as not to tire me, had planned them beforehand with the aid of an itinerary drawn up by my father according to districts rather than to degrees of kinship. But no sooner had we entered the drawing-room of the distant cousin whose claim to being visited first was that her house was at no distance from ours, than my mother was horrified to see standing there, his present of marrons glac\\u00e9s or d\\u00e9guis\\u00e9s in his hand, the bosom friend of the most sensitive of all my uncles, to whom he would at once go and report that we had not begun our round with him. And this uncle would certainly be hurt; he would have thought it quite natural that we should go from the Madeleine to the Jardin des Plantes, where he lived, before stopping at Saint-Augustin, on our way to the Rue de l\\u2019Ecole de M\\u00e9decine  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Our visits ended my grandmother had dispensed us from the duty of calling on her, since we were to dine there that evening, I ran all the way to the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es to give to our own special stall-keeper, with instructions to hand it over to the person who came to her several times a week from the Swanns to buy gingerbread, the letter which, on the day when my friend had caused me so much an iety, I had decided to send her at the New Year, and in which I told her that our old friendship was vanishing with the old year, that I would forget, now, my old sorrows and disappointments, and that, from this first day of January, it was a new friendship that we were going to cement, one so solid that nothing could destroy it, so wonderful that I hoped that Gilberte would go out of her way to preserve it in all its beauty, and to warn me in time, as I promised to warn her, should either of us detect the least sign of a peril that might endanger it. On our way home Fran\\u00e7oise made me stop at the corner of the Rue Royale, before an open-air stall from which she selected for her own stock of presents photographs of Pius IX and Raspail, while for myself I purchased one of Berma. The innumerable admiration which that artist e cited gave an air almost of poverty to this one face that she had to respond with, unalterable and precarious as are the garments of people who have not a \\u2018change,\\u2019 this face on which she must continually e pose to view only the tiny dimple upon her upper lip, the arch of her eyebrows, a few other physical peculiarities always the same, which, when it came to that, were at the mercy of a burn or a blow. This face, moreover, could not in itself have seemed to me beautiful, but it gave me the idea, and consequently the desire to kiss it by reason of all the kisses that it must have received, for which, from its page in the album, it seemed still to be appealing with that coquettishly tender gaze, that artificially ingenuous smile. For our Berma must indeed have felt for many young men those longings which she confessed under cover of the personality of Phaedra, longings of which everything, even the glamour of her name which enhanced her beauty and prolonged her youth, must render the gratification so easy to her. Night was falling; I stopped before a column of playbills, on which was posted that of the piece in which she was to appear on January 1. A moist and gentle breeze was blowing. It was a time of day and year that I knew; I suddenly felt a presentiment that New Year\\u2019s Day was not a day different from, the rest, that it was not the first day of a new world, in which, I might, by a chance that had never yet occurred, that was still intact, make Gilberte\\u2019s acquaintance afresh, as at the Creation of the World, as though the past had no longer any e istence, as though there had been obliterated, with the indications which I might have preserved for my future guidance, the disappointments which she had sometimes brought me; a new world in which nothing should subsist from the old \\u2014 save one thing, my desire that Gilberte should love me. I realised that if my heart hoped for such a reconstruction, round about it, of a uni that had not satisfied it before, it was because my heart had not altered, and I told myself that there was no reason why Gilberte\\u2019s should have altered either; I felt that this new friendship was the same, just as there is no boundary ditch between their forerunners and those new years which our desire for them, without being able to reach and so to modify them, invests, unknown to themselves, with distinctive names. I might dedicate this new year, if I chose, to Gilberte, and as one bases a religious system upon the blind laws of nature, endeavour to stamp New Year\\u2019s Day with the particular image that I had formed of it; but in vain, I felt that it was not aware that people called it New Year\\u2019s Day, that it was passing in a wintry dusk in a manner that was not novel to me; in the gentle breeze that floated about the column of playbills I had recognised, I had felt reappear the eternal, the universal substance, the familiar moisture, the unheeding fluidity of the old days and years  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 I returned to the house. I had spent the New Year\\u2019s Day of old men, who differ on that day from their juniors, not because people have ceased to give them presents but because they themselves have ceased to believe in the New Year. Presents I had indeed received, but not that present which alone could bring me pleasure, namely a line from Gilberte. I was young still, none the less, since I had been able to write her one, by means of which I hoped, in telling her of my solitary dreams of love and longing, to arouse similar dreams in her. The sadness of men who have grown old lies in their no longer even thinking of writing such letters, the futility of which their e perience has shewn  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 After I was in bed, the noises of the street, unduly prolonged upon this festive evening, kept me awake. I thought of all the people who were ending the night in pleasure, of the lover, the troop, it might be, of debauchees who would be going to meet Berma at the stage-door after the play that I had seen announced for this evening. I was not even able, so as to calm the agitation which that idea engendered in me during my sleepless night, to assure myself that Berma was not, perhaps, thinking about love, since the lines that she was reciting, which she had long and carefully rehearsed, reminded her at every moment that love is an e quisite thing, as of course she already knew, and knew so well that she displayed its familiar pangs \\u2014 only enriched with a new violence and an unsuspected sweetness \\u2014 to her astonished audience; and yet each of them had felt those pangs himself. I lighted my candle again, to look once more upon her face. At the thought that it was, no doubt, at that very moment being caressed by those men whom I could not prevent from giving to Berma and receiving from her joys superhuman but vague, I felt an emotion more cruel than voluptuous, a longing that was aggravated presently by the sound of a horn, as one hears it on the nights of the Lenten carnival and often of other public holidays, which, because it then lacks all poetry, is more saddening, coming from a toy squeaker, than \\u201cat evening, in the depth of the woods.\\u201d At that moment, a message from Gilberte would perhaps not have been what I wanted. Our desires cut across one another\\u2019s paths, and in this confused e istence it is but rarely that a piece of good fortune coincides with the desire that clamoured for it  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 I continued to go to the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es on fine days, along streets whose stylish pink houses seemed to be washed because e hibitions of water-colours were then at the height of fashion in a lightly floating atmosphere. It would be untrue to say that in those days the palaces of Gabriel struck me as being of greater beauty, or even of another epoch than the adjoining houses. I found more style, and should have supposed more antiquity if not in the Palais de l\\u2019Industrie at any rate in the Troca-d\\u00e9ro. Plunged in a restless sleep, my adolescence embodied in one uniform vision the whole of the quarter through which it might be strolling, and I had never dreamed that there could be an eighteenth century building in the Rue Royale, just as I should have been astonished to learn that the Porte-Saint-Martin and the Porte-Saint-Denis, those glories of the age of Louis XIV, were not contemporary with the most recently built tenements in the sordid regions that bore their names. Once only one of Gabriel\\u2019s palaces made me stop for more than a moment; that was because, night having fallen, its columns, dematerialised by the moonlight, had the appearance of having been cut out in pasteboard, and by recalling to me a scene in the operetta Orph\\u00e9e au  Enfers gave me for the first time an impression of beauty  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Meanwhile Gilberte never came to the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es. And yet it was imperative that I should see her, for I could not so much as remember what she was like. The questing, an ious, e acting way that we have of looking at the person we love, our eagerness for the word which shall give us or take from us the hope of an appointment for the morrow, and, until that word is uttered, our alternative if not simultaneous imaginings of joy and of despair, all these make our observation, in the beloved object\\u2019s presence, too tremulous to be able to carry away a clear impression of her. Perhaps, also, that activity of all the senses at once which endeavours to learn from the visible aspect alone what lies behind it is over-indulgent to the thousand forms, to the changing fragrance, to the movements of the living person whom as a rule, when we are not in love, we regard as fi ed in one permanent position. Whereas the beloved model does not stay still; and our mental photographs of her are always blurred. I did not rightly know how Gilberte\\u2019s features were composed, save in the heavenly moments when she disclosed them to me; I could remember nothing but her smile. And not being able to see again that beloved face, despite every effort that I might make to recapture it, I would be disgusted to find, outlined in my memory with a maddening precision of detail, the meaningless, emphatic faces of the man with the wooden horses and of the barley-sugar woman; just as those who have lost a dear friend whom they never see even while they are asleep, are e asperated at meeting incessantly in their dreams any number of insupportable creatures whom it is quite enough to have known in the waking world. In their inability to form any image of the object of their grief they are almost led to assert that they feel no grief. And I was not far from believing that, since I could not recall the features of Gilberte, I had forgotten Gilberte herself, and no longer loved her. At length she returned to play there almost every day, setting before me fresh pleasures to desire, to demand of her for the morrow, indeed making my love for her every day, in this sense, a new love. But an incident was to change once again, and abruptly, the manner in which, at about two o\\u2019clock every afternoon, the problem of my love confronted me. Had M. Swann intercepted the letter that I had written to his daughter, or was Gilberte merely confessing to me long after the event, and so that I should be more prudent in future, a state of things already long established? As I was telling her how greatly I admired her father and mother, she assumed that vague air, full of reticence and kept secrets, which she invariably wore when anyone spoke to her of what she was going to do, her walks, drives, visits \\u2014 then suddenly e pressed it with: \\u201cYou know, they can\\u2019t abide you!\\u201d and, slipping from me like the Undine that she was, burst out laughing. Often her laughter, out of harmony with her words, seemed, as music seems, to be tracing an invisible surface on another plane. M. and Mme. Swann did not require Gilberte to give up playing with me, but they would have been just as well pleased, she thought, if we had never begun. They did not look upon our relations with a kindly eye; they believed me to be a young person of low moral standard and imagined that my influence over their daughter must be evil. This type of unscrupulous young man whom the Swanns thought that I resembled, I pictured him to myself as detesting the parents of the girl he loved, flattering them to their faces but, when he was alone with her, making fun of them, urging her on to disobey them and, when once he had completed his conquest, not allowing them even to set eyes on her again. With these characteristics though they are never those under which the basest of scoundrels recognises himself how vehemently did my heart contrast the sentiments that did indeed animate it with regard to Swann, so passionate, on the contrary, that I never doubted that, were he to have the least suspicion of them, he must repent of his condemnation of me as of a judicial error. All that I felt about him I made bold to e press to him in a long letter which I entrusted to Gilberte, with the request that she would deliver it. She consented. Alas! so he saw in me an even greater impostor than I had feared; those sentiments which I had supposed myself to be portraying, in si teen pages, with such amplitude of truth, so he had suspected them; in short, the letter that I had written him, as ardent and as sincere as the words that I had uttered to M. de Norpois, met with no more success. Gilberte told me ne t day, after taking me aside behind a clump of laurels, along a little path by which we sat down on a couple of chairs, that as he read my letter, which she had now brought back to me, her father had shrugged his shoulders, with: \\u201cAll this means nothing; it only goes to prove how right I was.\\u201d I, who knew the purity of my intentions, the goodness of my soul, was furious that my words should not even have impinged upon the surface of Swann\\u2019s ridiculous error. For it was an error; of that I had then no doubt. I felt that I had described with such accuracy certain irrefutable characteristics of my generous sentiments that, if Swann had not at once reconstructed these from my indications, had not come to ask my forgiveness and to admit that he had been mistaken, it must be because these noble sentiments he had never himself e perienced, which would make him incapable of understanding the e istence of them in other people  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Well, perhaps it was simply that Swann knew that generosity is often no more than the inner aspect which our egotistical feelings assume when we have not yet named and classified them. Perhaps he had recognised in the sympathy that I e pressed for him simply an effect \\u2014 and the strongest possible proof \\u2014 of my love for Gilberte, by which, and not by any subordinate veneration of himself, my subsequent actions would be irresistibly controlled. I was unable to share his point of view, since I had not succeeded in abstracting my love from myself, in forcing it back into the common e perience of humanity, and thus suffering, e perimentally, its consequences; I was in despair. I was obliged to leave Gilberte for a moment; Fran\\u00e7oise had called me. I must accompany her into a little pavilion covered in a green trellis, not unlike one of the disused toll-houses of old Paris, in which had recently been installed what in England they call a lavatory but in France, by an ill-informed piece of anglomania, \\u2018water-closets.\\u2019 The old, damp walls at the entrance, where I stood waiting for Fran\\u00e7oise, emitted a chill and fusty smell which, relieving me at once of the an ieties that Swann\\u2019s words, as reported by Gilberte, had just awakened in me, pervaded me with a pleasure not at all of the same character as other pleasures, which leave one more unstable than before, incapable of retaining them, of possessing them, but, on the contrary, with a consistent pleasure on which I could lean for support, delicious, soothing, rich with a truth that was lasting, une plained and certain. I should have liked, as long ago in my walks along the Guermantes way, to endeavour to penetrate the charm of this impression which had seized hold of me, and, remaining there motionless, to interrogate this antiquated emanation which invited me not to enjoy the pleasure which it was offering me only as an \\u2018e tra,\\u2019 but to descend into the underlying reality which it had not yet disclosed to me. But the tenant of the establishment, an elderly dame with painted cheeks and an auburn wig, was speaking to me. Fran\\u00e7oise thought her \\u2018very well-to-do indeed.\\u2019 Her \\u2018missy\\u2019 had married what Fran\\u00e7oise called \\u2018a young man of family,\\u2019 which meant that he differed more, in her eyes, from a workman than, in Saint-Simon\\u2019s, a duke did from a man \\u2018risen from the dregs of the people.\\u2019 No doubt the tenant, before entering upon her tenancy, had met with reverses. But Fran\\u00e7oise was positive that she was a \\u2018marquise,\\u2019 and belonged to the Saint-Ferr\\u00e9ol family. This \\u2018marquise\\u2019 warned me not to stand outside in the cold, and even opened one of her doors for me, saying: \\u201cWon\\u2019t you go inside for a minute? Look, here\\u2019s a nice, clean one, and I shan\\u2019t charge you anything.\\u201d Perhaps she just made this offer in the spirit in which the young ladies at Gouache\\u2019s, when we went in there to order something, used to offer me one of the sweets which they kept on the counter under glass bells, and which, alas, Mamma would never allow me to take; perhaps with less innocence, like an old florist whom Mamma used to have in to replenish her flower-stands, who rolled languishing eyes at me as she handed me a rose. In any event, if the \\u2018marquise\\u2019 had a weakness for little boys, when she threw open to them the hypogean doors of those cubicles of stone in which men crouch like sphin es, she must have been moved to that generosity less by the hope of corrupting them than by the pleasure which all of us feel in displaying a needless prodigality to those whom we love, for I have never seen her with any other visitor e cept an old park-keeper  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 A moment later I said good-bye to the \\u2018marquise,\\u2019 and went out accompanied by Fran\\u00e7oise, whom I left to return to Gilberte. I caught sight of her at once, on a chair, behind the clump of laurels. She was there so as not to be seen by her friends: they were playing at hide-and-seek. I went and sat down by her side. She had on a flat cap which drooped forwards over her eyes, giving her the same \\u2018underhand,\\u2019 brooding, crafty look which I had remarked in her that first time at Comb ray. I asked her if there was not some way for me to have it out with her father, face to face. Gilberte said that she had suggested that to him, but that he had not thought it of any use. \\u201cLook,\\u201d she went on, \\u201cdon\\u2019t go away without your letter; I must run along to the others, as they haven\\u2019t caught me.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Had Swann appeared on the scene then before I had recovered it, this letter, by the sincerity of which I felt that he had been so unreasonable in not letting himself be convinced, perhaps he would have seen that it was he who had been in the right. For as I approached Gilberte, who, leaning back in her chair, told me to take the letter but did not hold it out to me, I felt myself so irresistibly attracted by her body that I said to her: \\u201cLook! You try to stop me from getting it; we\\u2019ll see which is the stronger.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 She thrust it behind her back; I put my arms round her neck, raising the plaits of hair which she wore over her shoulders, either because she was still of an age for that or because her mother chose to make her look a child for a little longer so that she herself might still seem young; and we wrestled, locked together. I tried to pull her towards me, she resisted; her cheeks, inflamed by the effort, were as red and round as two cherries; she laughed as though I were tickling her; I held her gripped between my legs like a young tree which I was trying to climb; and, in the middle of my gymnastics, when I was already out of breath with the muscular e ercise and the heat of the game, I felt, as it were a few drops of sweat wrung from me by the effort, my pleasure e press itself in a form which I could not even pause for a moment to analyse; immediately I snatched the letter from her. Whereupon Gilberte said, good-naturedly:  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cYou know, if you like, we might go on wrestling for a little.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Perhaps she was dimly conscious that my game had had another object than that which I had avowed, but too dimly to have been able to see that I had attained it. And I, who was afraid that she had seen and a slight recoil, as though of offended modesty which she made and checked a moment later made me think that my fear had not been unfounded, agreed to go on wrestling, lest she should suppose that I had indeed no other object than that, after which I wished only to sit quietly by her side  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 On my way home I perceived, I suddenly recollected the impression, concealed from me until then, towards which, without letting me distinguish or recognise it, the cold, almost sooty smell of the trellised pavilion had borne me. It was that of my uncle Adolphe\\u2019s little sitting-room at Combray, which had indeed e haled the same odour of humidity. But I could not understand, and I postponed the attempt to discover why the recollection of so trivial an impression had given me so keen a happiness. It struck me, however, that I did indeed deserve the contempt of M. de Norpois; I had preferred, hitherto, to all other writers, one whom he styled a mere \\u2018flute-player\\u2019 and a positive rapture had been conveyed to me, not by any important idea, but by a mouldy smell  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 For some time past, in certain households, the name of the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es, if a visitor mentioned it, would be greeted by the mother of the family with that air of contempt which mothers keep for a physician of established reputation whom they have or so they make out seen make too many false diagnoses to have any faith left in him; people insisted that these gardens were not good for children, that they knew of more than one sore throat, more than one case of measles and any number of feverish chills for which the Champs must be held responsible. Without venturing openly to doubt the maternal affection of Mamma, who continued to let me play there, several of her friends deplored her inability to see what was as plain as daylight  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Neurotic subjects are perhaps less addicted than any, despite the time-honoured phrase, to \\u2018listening to their insides\\u2019: they can hear so many things going on inside themselves, by which they realise later that they did wrong to let themselves be alarmed, that they end by paying no attention to any of them. Their nervous systems have so often cried out to them for help, as though from some serious malady, when it was merely because snow was coming, or because they had to change their rooms, that they have acquired the habit of paying no more heed to these warnings than a soldier who in the heat of battle perceives them so little that he is capable, although dying, of carrying on for some days still the life of a man in perfect health. One morning, bearing arranged within me all my regular disabilities, from whose constant, internal circulation I kept my mind turned as resolutely away as from the circulation of my blood, I had come running into the dining-room where my parents were already at table, and \\u2014 having assured myself, as usual, that to feel cold may mean not that one ought to warm oneself but that, for instance, one has received a scolding, and not to feel hungry that it is going to rain, and not that one ought not to eat anything \\u2014 had taken my place between them when, in the act of swallowing the first mouthful of a particularly tempting cutlet, a nausea, a giddiness stopped me, the feverish reaction of a malady that had already begun, the symptoms of which had been masked, retarded by the ice of my indifference, but which obstinately refused the nourishment that I was not in a fit state to absorb. Then, at the same moment, the thought that they would stop me from going out if they saw that I was unwell gave me, as the instinct of self-preservation gives a wounded man, the strength to crawl to my own room, where I found that I had a temperature of 104, and then to get ready to go to the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es. Through the languid and vulnerable shell which encased them, my eager thoughts were urging me towards, were clamouring for the soothing delight of a game of prisoner\\u2019s base with Gilberte, and an hour later, barely able to keep on my feet, but happy in being by her side, I had still the strength to enjoy it  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Fran\\u00e7oise, on our return, declared that I had been \\u2018taken bad,\\u2019 that I must have caught a \\u2018hot and cold,\\u2019 while the doctor, who was called in at once, declared that he \\u2018preferred\\u2019 the \\u2018severity,\\u2019 the \\u2018virulence\\u2019 of the rush of fever which accompanied my congestion of the lungs, and would be no more than \\u2018a fire of straw,\\u2019 to other forms, more \\u2018insidious\\u2019 and \\u2018septic.\\u2019 For some time now I had been liable to choking fits, and our doctor, braving the disapproval of my grandmother, who could see me already dying a drunkard\\u2019s death, had recommended me to take, as well as the caffeine which had been prescribed to help me to breathe, beer, champagne or brandy when I felt an attack coming. These attacks would subside, he told me, in the \\u2018euphoria\\u2019 brought about by the alcohol. I was often obliged, so that my grandmother should allow them to give it to me, instead of dissembling, almost to make a display of my state of suffocation. On the other hand, as soon as I felt an attack coming, never being quite certain what proportions it would assume, I would grow distressed at the thought of my grandmother\\u2019s an iety, of which I was far more afraid than of my own sufferings. But at the same time my body, either because it was too weak to keep those sufferings secret, or because it feared lest, in their ignorance of the imminent disaster, people might demand of me some e ertion which it would have found impossible or dangerous, gave me the need to warn my grandmother of my attacks with a punctiliousness into which I finally put a sort of physiological scruple. Did I perceive in myself a disturbing symptom which I had not previously observed, my body was in distress so long as I had not communicated it to my grandmother. Did she pretend to pay no attention, it made me insist. Sometimes I went too far; and that dear face, which was no longer able always to control its emotion as in the past, would allow an e pression of pity to appear, a painful contraction. Then my heart was wrung by the sight of her grief; as if my kisses had had power to e pel that grief, as if my affection could give my grandmother as much joy as my recovery, I flung myself into her arms. And its scruples being at the same time calmed by the certainty that she now knew the discomfort that I felt, my body offered no opposition to my reassuring her. I protested that this discomfort had been nothing, that I was in no sense to be pitied, that she might be quite sure that I was now happy; my body had wished to secure e actly the amount of pity that it deserved, and, provided that someone knew that it \\u2018had a pain\\u2019 in its right side, it could see no harm in my declaring that this pain was of no consequence and was not an obstacle to my happiness; for my body did not pride itself on its philosophy; that was outside its province. Almost every day during my convalescence I passed through these crises of suffocation. One evening, after my grandmother had left me comparatively well, she returned to my room very late and, seeing me struggling for breath, \\u201cOh, my poor boy,\\u201d she e claimed, her face quivering with sympathy, \\u201cyou are in dreadful pain.\\u201d She left me at once; I heard the outer gate open, and in a little while she came back with some brandy which she had gone out to buy, since there was none in the house. Presently I began to feel better. My grandmother, who was rather flushed, seemed \\u2018put out\\u2019 about something, and her eyes had a look of weariness and dejection  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cI shall leave you alone now, and let you get the good of this improvement,\\u201d she said, rising suddenly to go. I detained her, however, for a kiss, and could feel on her cold cheek something moist, but did not know whether it was the dampness of the night air through which she had just passed. Ne t day, she did not come to my room until the evening, having had, she told me, to go out. I considered that this shewed a surprising indifference to my welfare, and I had to restrain myself so as not to reproach her with it  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 As my chokings had persisted long after any congestion remained that could account for them, my parents asked for a consultation with Professor Cottard. It is not enough that a physician who is called in to treat cases of this sort should be learned. Brought face to face with symptoms which may or may not be those of three or four different complaints, it is in the long run his instinct, his eye that must decide with which, despite the more or less similar appearance of them all, he has to deal. This mysterious gift does not imply any superiority in the other departments of the intellect, and a creature of the utmost vulgarity, who admires the worst pictures, the worst music, in whose mind there is nothing out of the common, may perfectly well possess it. In my case, what was physically evident might equally well have been due to nervous spasms, to the first stages of tuberculosis, to asthma, to a to i-alimentary dyspnoea with renal insufficiency, to chronic bronchitis, or to a comple  state into which more than one of these factors entered. Now, nervous spasms required to be treated firmly, and discouraged, tuberculosis with infinite care and with a \\u2018feeding-up\\u2019 process which would have been bad for an arthritic condition such as asthma, and might indeed have been dangerous in a case of to i-alimentary dyspnoea, this last calling for a strict diet which, in return, would be fatal to a tuberculous patient. But Cottard\\u2019s hesitations were brief and his prescriptions imperious. \\u201cPurges; violent and drastic purges; milk for some days, nothing but milk. No meat. No alcohol.\\u201d My mother murmured that I needed, all the same, to be \\u2018built up,\\u2019 that my nerves were already weak, that drenching me like a horse and restricting my diet would make me worse. I could see in Cottard\\u2019s eyes, as uneasy as though he were afraid of missing a train, that he was asking himself whether he had not allowed his natural good-humour to appear. He was trying to think whether he had remembered to put on his mask of coldness, as one looks for a mirror to see whether one has not forgotten to tie one\\u2019s tie. In his uncertainty, and, so as, whatever he had done, to put things right, he replied brutally: \\u201cI am not in the habit of repeating my instructions. Give me a pen. Now remember, milk! Later on, when we have got the crises and the agrypnia by the throat, I should like you to take a little clear soup, and then a little broth, but always with milk; au lait! You\\u2019ll enjoy that, since Spain is all the rage just now; oll\\u00e9, oll\\u00e9!\\u201d His pupils knew this joke well, for he made it at the hospital whenever he had to put a heart or liver case on a milk diet. \\u201cAfter that, you will gradually return to your normal life. But whenever there is any coughing or choking \\u2014 purges, injections, bed, milk!\\u201d He listened with icy calm, and without uttering a word, to my mother\\u2019s final objections, and as he left us without having condescended to e plain the reasons for this course of treatment, my parents concluded that it had no bearing on my case, and would weaken me to no purpose, and so they did not make me try it. Naturally they sought to conceal their disobedience from the Professor, and to succeed in this avoided all the houses in which he was likely to be found. Then, as my health became worse, they decided to make me follow out Cottard\\u2019s prescriptions to the letter; in three days my \\u2018rattle\\u2019 and cough had ceased, I could breathe freely. Whereupon we realised that Cottard, while finding, as he told us later on, that I was distinctly asthmatic, and still more inclined to \\u2018imagine things,\\u2019 had seen that what was really the matter with me at the moment was into ication, and that by loosening my liver and washing out my kidneys he would get rid of the congestion of my bronchial tubes and thus give me back my breath, my sleep and my strength. And we realised that this imbecile was a clinical genius. At last I was able to get up. But they spoke of not letting me go any more to the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es. They said that it was because the air there was bad; but I felt sure that this was only a prete t so that I should not see Mlle. Swann, and I forced myself to repeat the name of Gilberte all the time, like the native tongue which peoples in captivity endeavour to preserve among themselves so as not to forget the land that they will never see again. Sometimes my mother would stroke my forehead with her hand, saying: \\u201cSo little boys don\\u2019t tell Mamma their troubles any more?\\u201d And Fran\\u00e7oise used to come up to me every day with: \\u201cWhat a face, to be sure! If you could just see yourself I Anyone would think there was a corpse in the house.\\u201d It is true that, if I had simply had a cold in the head, Fran\\u00e7oise would have assumed the same funereal air. These lamentations pertained rather to her \\u2018class\\u2019 than to the state of my health. I could not at the time discover whether this pessimism was due to sorrow or to satisfaction. I decided provisionally that it was social and professional  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 One day, after the postman had called, my mother laid a letter upon my bed. I opened it carelessly, since it could not bear the one signature that would have made me happy, the name of Gilberte, with whom I had no relations outside the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es. And lo, at the foot of the page, embossed with a silver seal representing a man\\u2019s head in a helmet, and under him a scroll with the device Per viam rectam, beneath a letter written in a large and flowing hand, in which almost every word appeared to be underlined, simply because the crosses of the \\u2018t\\u2019s\\u2019 ran not across but over them, and so drew a line beneath the corresponding letters of the word above, it was indeed Gilberte\\u2019s signature and nothing else that I saw. But because I knew that to be impossible upon a letter addressed to myself, the sight of it, unaccompanied by any belief in it, gave me no pleasure. For a moment it merely struck an impression of unreality on everything round about me. With lightning rapidity the impossible signature danced about my bed, the fireplace, the four walls. I saw everything sway, as one does when one falls from a horse, and I asked myself whether there was not an e istence altogether different from the one I knew, in direct contradiction of it, but itself the true e istence, which, being suddenly revealed to me, filled me with that hesitation which sculptors, in representing the Last Judgment, have given to the awakening dead who find themselves at the gates of the ne t world. \\u201cMy dear Friend,\\u201d said the letter, \\u201cI hear that you have been very ill and have given up going to the Champs-E\\u00eeys\\u00e9es. I hardly ever go there either because there has been such an enormous lot of illness. But I\\u2019m having my friends to tea here every Monday and Friday. Mamma asks me to tell you that it will be a great pleasure to us all if you will come too, as soon as you are well again, and we can have some more nice talks here, just like the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es. Good-bye, dear friend; I hope that your parents will allow you to come to tea very often. With all my kindest regards. GILBERTE.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 While I was reading these words, my nervous system was receiving, with admirable promptitude, the news that a piece of great good fortune had befallen me. But my mind, that is to say myself, and in fact the party principally concerned, was still in ignorance. Such good fortune, coming from Gilberte, was a thing of which I had never ceased to dream; a thing wholly in my mind, it was, as Leonardo says of painting, cosa mentale. Now, a sheet of paper covered with writing is not a thing that the mind assimilates at once. But as soon as I had finished reading the letter, I thought of it, it became an object of my dreams, became, it also, cosa mentale, and I loved it so much already that every few minutes I must read it, kiss it again. Then at last I was conscious of my happiness  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Life is strewn with these miracles, for which people who are in love can always hope. It is possible that this one had been artificially brought about by my mother who, seeing that for some time past I had lost all interest in life, may have suggested to Gilberte to write to me, just as, when I was little and went first to the sea-side, so as to give me some pleasure in bathing, which I detested because it took away my breath, she used secretly to hand to the man who was to \\u2018dip\\u2019 me marvellous bo es made of shells, and branches of coral, which I believed that I myself had discovered lying at the bottom of the sea. However, with every occurrence which, in our life and among its contrasted situations, bears any relation to love, it is best to make no attempt to understand it, since in so far as these are ine orable, as they are unlooked-for, they appear to be governed by magic rather than by rational laws. When a multi-millionaire \\u2014 who for all his millions is quite a charming person \\u2014 sent packing by a poor and unattractive woman with whom he has been living, calls to his aid, in his desperation, all the resources of wealth, and brings every worldly influence to bear without succeeding in making her take him back, it is wiser for him, in the face of the implacable obstinacy of his mistress, to suppose that Fate intends to crush him, and to make him die of an affection of the heart, than to seek any logical e planation. These obstacles, against which lovers have to contend, and which their imagination, over-e cited by suffering, seeks in vain to analyse, are contained, as often as not, in some peculiar characteristic of the woman whom they cannot bring back to themselves, in her stupidity, in the influence acquired over her, the fears suggested to her by people whom the lover does not know, in the kind of pleasures which, at the moment, she is demanding of life, pleasures which neither her lover nor her lover\\u2019s wealth can procure for her. In any event, the lover is scarcely in a position to discover the nature of these obstacles, which her woman\\u2019y cunning hides from him and his own judgment, falsified by love, prevents him from estimating e actly. They may be compared with those tumours which the doctor succeeds in reducing, but without having traced them to their source. Like them these obstacles remain mysterious but are temporary. Only they last, as a rule, longer than love itself. And as that is not a disinterested passion, the lover who is no longer in love does not seek to know why the woman, neither rich nor virtuous, with whom he was in love refused obstinately for years to let him continue to keep her  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Now the same mystery which often veils from our eyes the reason for a catastrophe, when love is in question, envelops just as frequently the suddenness of certain happy solutions, such as had come to me with Gilberte\\u2019s letter. Happy, or at least seemingly happy, for there are few solutions that can really be happy when we are dealing with a sentiment of such a kind that every satisfaction which we can bring to it does no more, as a rule, than dislodge some pain. And yet sometimes a respite is granted us, and we have for a little while the illusion that we are healed  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 So far as concerns this letter, at the foot of which Fran\\u00e7oise declined to recognise Gilberte\\u2019s name, because the elaborate capital \\u2018G\\u2019 leaning against the undotted \\u2018i\\u2019 looked more like an \\u2018A,\\u2019 while the final syllable was indefinitely prolonged by a waving flourish, if we persist in looking for a rational e planation of the sudden reversal of her attitude towards me which it indicated, and which made me so radiantly happy, we may perhaps find that I was to some e tent indebted for it to an incident which I should have supposed, on the contrary, to be calculated to ruin me for ever in the sight of the Swann family. A short while back, Bloch had come to see me at a time when Professor Cottard, whom, now that I was following his instructions, we were again calling in, happened to be in my room. As his e amination of me was over, and he was sitting with me simply as a visitor because my parents had invited him to stay to dinner, Bloch was allowed to come in. While we were all talking, Bloch having mentioned that he had heard it said that Mme. Swann was very fond of me, by a lady with whom he had been dining the day before, who was herself very intimate with Mme. Swann, I should have liked to reply that he was most certainly mistaken, and to establish the fact from the same scruple of conscience that had made me proclaim it to M. de Norpois, and for fear of Mme. Swann\\u2019s taking me for a liar that I did not know her and had never spoken to her. But I had not the courage to correct Bloch\\u2019s mistake, because I could see quite well that it was deliberate, and that, if he invented something that Mme. Swann could not possibly have said, it was simply to let us know what he considered flattering to himself, and was not true either that he had been dining with one of that lady\\u2019s friends. And so it fell out that, whereas M. de Norpois, on learning that I did not know but would very much like to know Mme. Swann, had taken great care to avoid speaking to her about me, Cottard, who was her doctor also, having gathered from what he had heard Bloch say that she knew me quite well and thought highly of me, concluded that to remark, when ne t he saw her, that I was a charming young fellow and a great friend of his could not be of the smallest use to me and would be of advantage to himself, two reasons which made him decide to speak of me to Odette whenever an opportunity arose  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Thus at length I found my way into that abode from which was wafted even on to the staircase the scent that Mme. Swann used, though it was embalmed far more sweetly still by the peculiar, disturbing charm that emanated from the life of Gilberte. The implacable porter, transformed into a benevolent Eumenid, adopted the custom, when I asked him if I might go upstairs, of indicating to me, by raising his cap with a propitious hand, that he gave ear to my prayer. Those windows which, seen from outside, used to interpose between me and the treasures within, which were not intended for me, a polished, distant and superficial stare, which seemed to me the very stare of the Swanns themselves, it fell to my lot, when in the warm weather I had spent a whole afternoon with Gilberte in her room, to open them myself, so as to let in a little air, and even to lean over the sill of one of them by her side, if it was her mother\\u2019s \\u2018at home\\u2019 day, to watch the visitors arrive who would often, raising their heads as they stepped out of their carriages, greet me with a wave of the hand, taking me for some nephew of their hostess. At such moments Gilberte\\u2019s plaits used to brush my cheek. They seemed to me, in the fineness of their grain, at once natural and supernatural, and in the strength of their constructed tracery, a matchless work of art, in the composition of which had been used the very grass of Paradise. To a section of them, even infinitely minute, what celestial herbary would I not have given as a reliquary. But since I never hoped to obtain an actual fragment of those plaits, if at least I had been able to have their photograph, how far more precious than one of a sheet of flowers traced by Vinci\\u2019s pencil! To acquire one of these, I stooped \\u2014 with friends of the Swanns, and even with photographers \\u2014 to servilities which did not procure for me what I wanted, but tied me for life to a number of e tremely tiresome people  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Gilberte\\u2019s parents, who for so long had prevented me from seeing her, now \\u2014 when I entered the dark hall in which hovered perpetually, more formidable and more to be desired than, at Versailles of old, the apparition of the King, the possibility of my encountering them, in which too, invariably, after butting into an enormous hat-stand with seven branches, like the Candlestick in Holy Writ, I would begin bowing confusedly before a footman, seated among the skirts of his long grey coat upon the wood-bo , whom in the dim light I had mistaken for Mme. Swann \\u2014 Gilberte\\u2019s parents, if one of them happened to be passing at the moment of my arrival, so far from seeming annoyed would come and shake hands with a smile, and say:  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cHow d\\u2019e do?\\u201d They both pronounced it in the same clipped way, which, you may well imagine, once I was back at home, I made an incessant and delightful practice of copying. \\u201cDoes Gilberte know you\\u2019re here? She does? Then I\\u2019ll leave you to her.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Better still, the tea-parties themselves to which Gilberte invited her friends, parties which for so long had seemed to me the most insurmountable of the barriers heaped up between her and myself, became now an opportunity for uniting us of which she would inform me in a few lines, written because I was still a comparative stranger upon sheets that were always different. One was adorned with a poodle embossed in blue, above a fantastic inscription in English with an e clamation mark after it; another was stamped with an anchor, or with the monogram G. S. preposterously elongated in a rectangle which ran from top to bottom of the page, or else with the name Gilberte, now traced across one corner in letters of gold which imitated my friend\\u2019s signature and ended in a flourish, beneath an open umbrella printed in black, now enclosed in a monogram in the shape of a Chinaman\\u2019s hat, which contained all the letters of the word in capitals without its being possible to make out a single one of them. At last, as the series of different writing-papers which Gilberte possessed, numerous as it might be, was not unlimited, after a certain number of weeks I saw reappear the sheet that bore like the first letter she had written me the motto Per vaim rectam, and over it the man\\u2019s head in a helmet, set in a medallion of tarnished silver. And each of them was chosen, on one day rather than another, by virtue of a certain ritual, as I then supposed, but more probably, as I now think, because she tried to remember which of them she had already used, so as never to send the same one twice to any of her correspondents, of those at least whom she took special pains to please, save at the longest possible intervals. As, on account of the different times of their lessons, some of the friends whom Gilberte used to invite to her parties were obliged to leave just as the rest were arriving, while I was still on the stairs I could hear escaping from the hall a murmur of voices which, such was the emotion aroused in me by the imposing ceremony in which I was to take part, long before I had reached the landing, broke all the bonds that still held me to my past life, so that I did not even remember that I was to take off my muffler as soon as I felt too hot, and to keep an eye on the clock so as not to be late in getting home. That staircase, besides, a\\u00eel of wood, as they were built about that time in certain houses, in keeping with that Henri II style which had for so long been Odette\\u2019s ideal though she was shortly to lose interest in it, and furnished with a placard, to which there was no equivalent at home, on which one read the words: \\u201cNOTICE. The lift must not be taken downstairs,\\u201d seemed to me a thing so marvellous that I told my parents that it was an ancient staircase brought from ever so far away by M. Swann. My regard for the truth was so great that I should not have hesitated to give them this information even if I had known it to be false, for it alone could enable them to feel for the dignity of the Swanns\\u2019 staircase the same respect that I felt myself. It was just as, when one is talking to some ignorant person who cannot understand in what the genius of a great physician consists, it is as well not to admit that he does not know how to cure a cold in the head. But since I had no power of observation, since, as a general rule, I never knew either the name or the nature of things that were before my eyes, and could understand only that when they were connected with the Swanns they must be e traordinary, I was by no means certain that in notifying my parents of the artistic value and remote origin of the staircase I was guilty of falsehood. It did not seem certain; but it must have seemed probable, for I felt myself turn very red when my father interrupted me with: \\u201cI know those houses; I have been in one; they are all alike; Swann just has several floors in one; it was Berlier built them all.\\u201d He added that he had thought of taking a flat in one of them, but that he had changed his mind, finding that they were not conveniently arranged, and that the landings were too dark. So he said; but I felt instinctively that my mind must make the sacrifices necessary to the glory of the Swanns and to my own happiness, and by a stroke of internal authority, in spite of what I had just heard, I banished for ever from my memory, as a good Catholic banishes Renan\\u2019s Vie de J\\u00e9sus, the destroying thought that their house was just an ordinary flat in which we ourselves might have been living  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Meanwhile on those tea-party days, pulling myself up the staircase step by step, reason and memory already cast off like outer garments, and myself no more now than the sport of the basest refle es, I would arrive in the zone in which the scent of Mme. Swann greeted my nostrils. I felt that I could already behold the majesty of the chocolate cake, encircled by plates heaped with little cakes, and by tiny napkins of grey damask with figures on them, as required by convention but peculiar to the Swanns. But this unalterable and governed whole seemed, like Kant\\u2019s necessary universe, to depend on a supreme act of free will. For when we were all together in Gilberte\\u2019s little sitting-room, suddenly she would look at the clock and e claim:  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cI say! It\\u2019s getting a long time since luncheon, and we aren\\u2019t having dinner till eight. I feel as if I could eat something. What do you say?\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 And she would make us go into the dining-room, as sombre as the interior of an Asiatic Temple painted by Rembrandt, in which an architectural cake, as gracious and sociable as it was imposing, seemed to be enthroned there in any event, in case the fancy seized Gilberte to discrown it of its chocolate battlements and to hew down the steep brown slopes of its ramparts, baked in the oven like the bastions of the palace of Darius. Better still, in proceeding to the demolition of that Babylonitish pastry, Gilberte did not consider only her own hunger; she inquired also after mine, while she e tracted for me from the crumbling monument a whole glazed slab jewelled with scarlet fruits, in the oriental styje. She asked me even at what o\\u2019clock my parents were dining, as if I still knew, as if the disturbance that governed me had allowed to persist the sensation of satiety or of hunger, the notion of dinner or the picture of my family in my empty memory and paralysed stomach. Alas, its paralysis was but momentary. The cakes that I took without noticing them, a time would come when I should have to digest them. But that time was still remote. Meanwhile Gilberte was making \\u2018my\\u2019 tea. I went on drinking it indefinitely, whereas a single cup would keep me awake for twenty-four hours. Which e plains why my mother used always to say: \\u201cWhat a nuisance it is; he can never go to the Swarms\\u2019 without coming home ill.\\u201d But was I aware even, when I was at the Swanns\\u2019, that it was tea that I was drinking? Had I known, I should have taken it just the same, for even supposing that I had recovered for a moment the sense of the present, that would not have restored to me the memory of the past or the apprehension of the future. My imagination was incapable of reaching to the distant tune in which I might have the idea of going to bed, and the need to sleep  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Gilberte\\u2019s girl friends were not all plunged in that state of into ication in which it is impossible to make up one\\u2019s mind. Some of them refused tea! Then Gilberte would say, using a phrase highly fashionable that year: \\u201cI can see I\\u2019m not having much of a success with my tea!\\u201d And to destroy more completely any idea of ceremony, she would disarrange the chairs that were drawn up round the table, with: \\u201cWe look just like a wedding breakfast. Good lord, what fools servants are!\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 She nibbled her cake, perched sideways upon a cross-legged seat placed at an angle to the table. And then, just as though she could have had all those cakes at her disposal without having first asked leave of her mother, when Mme. Swann, whose \\u2018day\\u2019 coincided as a rule with Gilberte\\u2019s tea-parties, had shewn one of her visitors to the door, and came sweeping in, a moment later, dressed sometimes in blue velvet, more often in a black satin gown draped with white lace, she would say with an air of astonishment: \\u201cI say, that looks good, what you\\u2019ve got there. It makes me quite hungry to see you all eating cake.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cBut, Mamma, do! We invite you!\\u201d Gilberte would answer  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 ####  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cThank you, no, my precious; what would my visitors say? I\\u2019ve still got Mme. Trombert and Mme. Cottard and Mme. Bontemps; you know dear Mme. Bontemps never pays very short visits, and she has only just come. What would all those good people say if I never went back to them? If no one else calls, I\\u2019ll come in again and have a chat with you which will be far more amusing after they\\u2019ve all gone. I really think I\\u2019ve earned a little rest; I have had forty-five different people to-day, and forty-two of them told me about G\\u00e9r\\u00f4me\\u2019s picture! But you must come alone one of these days,\\u201d she turned to me, \\u201cand take \\u2018your\\u2019 tea with Gilberte. She will make it for you just as you like it, as you have it in your own little \\u2018studio,\\u2019\\u201d she went on, flying off to her visitors, as if it had been something as familiar to me as my own habits such as the habit that I should have had of taking tea, had I ever taken it; as for my \\u2018studio,\\u2019 I was uncertain whether I had one or not that I had come to seek in this mysterious world. \\u201cWhen can you come? To-morrow? We will make you \\u2018toast\\u2019 every bit as good as you get at Colombin\\u2019s. No? You are horrid!\\u201d\\u2014 for, since she also had begun to form a salon, she had borrowed Mme. Verdurin\\u2019s mannerisms, and notably her tone of petulant autocracy. \\u2018Toast\\u2019 being as incomprehensible to me as \\u2018Colombin\\u2019s,\\u2019 this further promise could not add to my temptation. It will appear stranger still, now that everyone uses such e pressions \\u2014 and perhaps even at Combray they are creeping in \\u2014 that I had not at first understood of whom Mme. Swann was speaking when I heard her sing the praises of our old \\u2018nurse.\\u2019 I did not know any English; I gathered, however, as she went on that the word was intended to denote Fran\\u00e7oise. I who, in the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es, had been so terrified of the bad impression that she must make, I now learned from Mme. Swann that it was all the things that Gilberte had told them about my \\u2018nurse\\u2019 that had attracted her husband and her to me. \\u201cOne feels that she is so devoted to you; she must be nice!\\u201d At once my opinion of Fran\\u00e7oise was diametrically changed. By the same token, to have a governess equipped with a waterproof and a feather in her hat no longer appeared quite so essential. Finally I learned from some words which Mme. Swann let fall with regard to Mme. Blatin whose good nature she recognised but dreaded her visits that personal relations with that lady would have been of less value to me than I had supposed, and would not in any way have improved my standing with the Swanns  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 If I had now begun to e plore, with tremors of reverence and joy the faery domain which, against all probability, had opened to me its hitherto locked approaches, this was still only in my capacity as a friend of Gilberte. The kingdom into which I was received was itself contained within another, more mysterious still, in which Swann and his wife led their supernatural e istence and towards which they made their way, after taking my hand in theirs, when they crossed the hall at the same moment as myself but in the other direction. But soon I was to penetrate also to the heart of the Sanctuary. For instance, Gilberte might be out when I called, but M. or Mme. Swann was at home. They would ask who had rung, and on being told that it was myself would send out to ask me to come in for a moment and talk to them, desiring me to use in one way or another, and with this or that object in view, my influence over their daughter. I reminded myself of that letter, so complete, so convincing, which I had written to Swann only the other day, and which he had not deigned even to acknowledge. I marvelled at the impotence of the mind, the reason and the heart to effect the least conversion, to solve a single one of those difficulties which, in the sequel, life, without one\\u2019s so much as knowing what steps it has taken, so easily unravels. My new position as the friend of Gilberte, endowed with an e cellent influence over her, entitling me now to enjoy the same favours as if, having had as a companion at some school where they had always put me at the head of my class the son of a king, I had owed to that accident the right of informal entry into the palace and to audiences in the throne-room, Swann, with an infinite benevolence and as though he were not over-burdened with glorious occupations, would make me go into his library and there let me for an hour on end respond in stammered monosyllables, timid silences broken by brief and incoherent bursts of courage, to utterances of which my emotion prevented me from understanding a single word; would shew me works of art and books which he thought likely to interest me, things as to which I had no doubt, before seeing them, that they infinitely surpassed in beauty anything that the Louvre possessed or the National Library, but at which I found it impossible to look. At such moments I should have been grateful to Swann\\u2019s butler, had he demanded from me my watch, my tie-pin, my boots, and made me sign a deed acknowledging him as my heir: in the admirable words of a popular e pression of which, as of the most famous epics, we do not know who was the author, although, like those epics, and with all deference to Wolff and his theory, it most certainly had an author, one of those inventive, modest souls such as we come across every year, who light upon such gems as \\u2018putting a name to a face,\\u2019 though their own names they never let us learn, I did not know what I was doing. All the greater was my astonishment, when my visit was prolonged, at finding to what a zero of realisation, to what an absence of happy ending those hours spent in the enchanted dwelling led me. But my disappointment arose neither from the inadequacy of the works of art that were shewn to me nor from the impossibility of fi ing upon them my distracted gaze. For it was not the intrinsic beauty of the objects themselves that made it miraculous for me to be sitting in Swann\\u2019s library, it was the attachment to those objects \\u2014 which might have been the ugliest in the world \\u2014 of the particular feeling, melancholy and voluptuous, which I had for so many years localised in that room and which still impregnated it; similarly the multitude of mirrors, of silver-backed brushes, of altars to Saint Anthony of Padua, carved and painted by the most eminent artists, her friends, counted for nothing in the feeling of my own unworthiness and of her regal benevolence which was aroused in me when Mme. Swann received me for a moment in her own room, in which three beautiful and impressive creatures, her principal and second and third maids, smilingly prepared for her the most marvellous toilets, and towards which, on the order conveyed to me by the footman in knee-breeches that Madame wished to say a few words to me, I would make my way along the tortuous path of a corridor all embalmed, far and near, by the precious essences which e haled without ceasing from her dressing-room a fragrance e quisitely sweet  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 When Mme. Swann had returned to her visitors, we could still hear her talking and laughing, for even with only two people in the room, and as though she had to cope with all the \\u2018good friends\\u2019 at once, she would raise her voice, ejaculate her words, as she had so often in the \\u2018little clan\\u2019 heard its \\u2018Mistress\\u2019 do, at the moments when she \\u2018led the conversation.\\u2019 The e pressions which we have borrowed from other people being those which, for a time at least, we are fondest of using, Mme. Swann used to select at one time those which she had learned from distinguished psople whom her husband had not managed to prevent her from getting to know it was from them that she derived the mannerism which consists in suppressing the article or demonstrative pronoun, in French, before an adjective qualifying a person\\u2019s name, at another time others more plebeian such as \\u201cIt\\u2019s a mere nothing!\\u201d the favourite e pression of one of her friends, and used to make room for them in all the stories which, by a habit formed among the \\u2018little clan,\\u2019 she loved to tell about people. She would follow these up automatically with, \\u201cI do love that story!\\u201d or \\u201cDo admit, it\\u2019s a verygood story!\\u201d which came to her, through her husband, from the Guermantes, whom she did not know  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Mme. Swann had left the dining-room, but her husband, who had just returned home, made his appearance among us in turn.\\u2019 \\u201cDo you know if your mother is alone, Gilberte?\\u201d \\u201cNo, Papa, she has still some people.\\u201d \\u201cWhat, still? At seven o\\u2019clock! It\\u2019s appalling! The poor woman must be absolutely dead. It\\u2019s odious.\\u201d At home I had always heard the first syllable of this word pronounced with a long \\u2018o,\\u2019 like \\u2018ode,\\u2019 but M. and Mme. Swann made it short, as in \\u2018odd.\\u2019 \\u201cJust think of it; ever since two o\\u2019clock this afternoon!\\u201d he went on, turning to me. \\u201cAnd Camille tells me that between four and five he let in at least a dozen people. Did I say a dozen? I believe he told me fourteen. No, a dozen; I don\\u2019t remember. When I came home I had quite forgotten it was her \\u2018day,\\u2019 and when I saw all those carriages outside the door I thought there must be a wedding in the house. And just now, while I\\u2019ve been in the library for a minute, the bell has never stopped ringing; upon my word, it\\u2019s given me quite a headache. And are there a lot of them in there still?\\u201d \\u201cNo; only two.\\u201d \\u201cWho are they, do you know?\\u201d \\u201cMme. Cottard and Mme. Bontemps.\\u201d \\u201cOh! the wife of the Chief Secretary to the Minister of Posts.\\u201d \\u201cI know her husband\\u2019s a clerk in some Ministry or other, but I don\\u2019t know what he does.\\u201d Gilberte assumed a babyish manner  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that? You silly child, you talk as if you were two years old. What do you mean; \\u2018a clerk in some Ministry or other\\u2019 indeed! He is nothing less than Chief Secretary, chief of the whole show, and what\\u2019s more \\u2014 what on earth am I thinking of? Upon my word, I\\u2019m getting as stupid as yourself; he is not the Chief Secretary, he\\u2019s the Permanent Secretary.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t know, I\\u2019m sure; does that mean a lot, being Permanent Secretary?\\u201d answered Gilberte, who never let slip an opportunity of displaying her own indifference to anything that gave her parents cause for vanity. She may, of course, have considered that she only enhanced the brilliance of such an acquaintance by not seeming to attach any undue importance to it.  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cI should think it did \\u2018mean a lot\\u2019!\\u201d e claimed Swann, who preferred to this modesty, which might have left me in doubt, a more e plicit mode of speech. \\u201cWhy it means simply that he\\u2019s the first man after the Minister. In fact, he\\u2019s more important than the Minister, because it is he that does all the work. Besides, it appears that he has immense capacity, a man quite of the first rank, a most distinguished individual. He\\u2019s an Officer of the Legion of Honour. A delightful man, he is, and very good-looking too.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 This man\\u2019s wife, incidentally, had married him against everyone\\u2019s wishes and advica because he was a \\u2018charming creature.\\u2019 He had, what may be sufficient to constitute a rare and delicate whole, a fair, silky beard, good features, a nasal voice, powerful lungs and a glass eye.  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cI may tell you,\\u201d he added, turning again to me, \\u201cthat I am greatly amused to see that lot serving in the present Government, because they are Bontemps of the Bontemps-Chenut family, typical old-fashioned middle-class people, reactionary, clerical, tremendously strait-laced. Your grandfather knew quite well \\u2014 at least by name and by sight he must have known old Chenut, the father, who never tipped the cabmen more than a ha\\u2019penny, though he was a rich enough man for those days, and the Baron Br\\u00e9au-Chenut. All their money went in the Union G\\u00e9n\\u00e9rale smash \\u2014 you\\u2019re too young to remember that, of course \\u2014 and, gad! they\\u2019ve had to get it back as best they could.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cHe\\u2019s the uncle of a little girl who used to come to my lessons, in a class a long way below mine, the famous \\u2018Albertine.\\u2019 She\\u2019s certain to be dreadfully \\u2018fast\\u2019 when she\\u2019s older, but just now she\\u2019s the quaintest spectacle.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cShe is amazing, this daughter of mine. She knows everyone.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cI don\\u2019t know her. I only used to see her going about, and hear them calling \\u2018Albertine\\u2019 here, and \\u2018Albertine\\u2019 there. But I do know Mme. Bontemps, and I don\\u2019t like her much either.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cYou are quite wrong; she is charming, pretty, intelligent. In fact, she\\u2019s quite clever. I shall go in and say how d\\u2019e do to her, and ask her if her husband thinks we\\u2019re going to have war, and whether we can rely on King Theodosius. He\\u2019s bound to know, don\\u2019t you think, since he\\u2019s in the counsels of the gods.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 It was not thus that Swann used to talk in days gone by; but which of us cannot call to mind some royal princess of limited intelligence who let herself be carried off by a footman, and then, ten years later, tried to get back into society, and found that people were not very willing to call upon her; have we not found her spontaneously adopting the language of all the old bores, and, when we referred to some duchess who was at the height of fashion, heard her say: \\u201cShe came to see me only yesterday,\\u201d or \\u201cI live a very quiet life.\\u201d So that it is superfluous to make a study of manners, since we can deduce them all from psychological laws  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 The Swanns shared this eccentricity of people who have not many friends; a visit, an invitation, a mere friendly word from some one ever so little prominent were for them events to which they aspired to give full publicity. If bad luck would have it that the Verdurins were in London when Odette gave a rather smart dinner-party, arrangements were made by which some common friend was to \\u2018cable\\u2019 a report to them across the Channel. Even the complimentary letters and telegrams received by Odette the Swanns were incapable of keeping to themselves. They spoke of them to their friends, passed them from hand to hand. Thus the Swanns\\u2019 drawing-room reminded one of a seaside hotel where telegrams containing the latest news are posted up on a board  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Still, people who had known the old Swann not merely outside society, as I had known him, but in society, in that Guermantes set which, with certain concessions to Highnesses and Duchesses, was almost infinitely e acting in the matter of wit and charm, from which banishment was sternly decreed for men of real eminence whom its members found boring or vulgar \\u2014 such people might have been astonished to observe that their old Swann had ceased to be not only discreet when he spoke of his acquaintance, but difficult when he was called upon to enlarge it. How was it that Mme. Bontemps, so common, so ill-natured, failed to e asperate him? How could he possibly describe her as attractive? The memory of the Guermantes set must, one would suppose, have prevented him; as a matter of fact it encouraged him. There was certainly among the Guermantes, as compared with the great majority of groups in society, taste, indeed a refined taste, but also a snobbishness from which there arose the possibility of a momentary interruption in the e ercise of that taste. If it were a question of some one who was not indispensable to their circle, of a Minister for Foreign Affairs, a Republican and inclined to be pompous, or of an Academician who talked too much, their taste would be brought to bear heavily against him, Swann would condole with Mme. de Guermantes on having had to sit ne t to such people at dinner at one of the Embassies, and they would a thousand times rather have a man of fashion, that is to say a man of the Guermantes kind, good for nothing, but endowed with the wit of the Guermantes, some one who was \\u2018of the same chapel\\u2019 as themselves. Only, a Grand Duchess, a Princess of the Blood, should she dine often with Mme. de Guermantes, would soon find herself enrolled in that chapel also, without having any right to be there, without being at all so endowed. But with the simplicity of people in society, from the moment they had her in their houses they went out of their way to find her attractive, since they were unable to say that it was because she was attractive that they invited her. Swann, coming to the rescue of Mme. de Guermantes, would say to her after the Highness had gone: \\u201cAfter all, she\\u2019s not such a bad woman; really, she has quite a sense of the comic. I don\\u2019t suppose for a moment that she has mastered the Critique of Pure Reason; still, she is not unattractive.\\u201d \\u201cOh, I do so entirely agree with you!\\u201d the Duchess would respond. \\u201cBesides, she was a little frightened of us all; you will see that she can be charming.\\u201d \\u201cShe is certainly a great deal less devastating than Mme. X\\u2014\\u2014\\u201d the wife of the talkative Academician, and herself a remarkable woman \\u201cwho quotes twenty volumes at you.\\u201d \\u201cOh, but there isn\\u2019t any comparison between them.\\u201d The faculty of saying such things as these, and of saying them sincerely, Swann had acquired from the Duchess, and had never lost. He made use of it now with reference to the people who came to his house. He forced himself to distinguish, and to admire in them the qualities that every human being will display if we e amine him with a prejudice in his favour, and not with the distaste of the nice-minded; he e tolled the merits of Mme. Bon-temps, as he had once e tolled those of the Princesse de Parme, who must have been e cluded from the Guermantes set if there had not been privileged terms of admission for certain Highnesses, and if, when they presented themselves for election, no consideration had indeed been paid e cept to wit and charm. We have seen already, moreover, that Swann had always an inclination which he was now putting into practice, only in a more lasting fashion to e change his social position for another which, in certain circumstances, might suit him better. It is only people incapable of analysing, in their perception, what at first sight appears indivisible who believe that one\\u2019s position is consolidated with one\\u2019s person. One and the same man, taken at successive points in his life, will be found to breathe, at different stages on the social ladder, in atmospheres that do not of necessity become more and more refined; whenever, in any period of our e istence, we form or re-form associations with a certain environment, and feel that we can move at ease in it and are made comfortable, we begin quite naturally to make ourselves fast to it by putting out roots and tendrils  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 In so far as Mme. Bontemps was concerned, I believe also that Swann, in speaking of her with so much emphasis, was not sorry to think that my parents would hear that she had been to see his wife. To tell the truth, in our house the names of the people whom Mme. Swann was gradually getting to know pricked our curiosity more than they aroused our admiration. At the name of Mme. Trombert, my mother e claimed: \\u201cAh! That\\u2019s a new recruit, and one who will bring in others.\\u201d And as though she found a similarity between the somewhat summary, rapid and violent manner in which Mme. Swann acquired her friends, as it were by conquest, and a Colonial e pedition, Mamma went on to observe: \\u201cNow that the Tromberts have surrendered, the neighbouring tribes will not be long in coming in.\\u201d If she had passed Mme. Swann in the street, she would tell us when she came home: \\u201cI saw Mme. Swann in all her war-paint; she must have been embarking on some triumphant offensive against the Massachutoes, or the Cingalese, or the Tromberts.\\u201d And so with all the new people whom I told her that I had seen in that somewhat composite and artificial society, to which they had often been brought with great difficulty and from widely different surroundings, Mamma would at once divine their origin, and, speaking of them as of trophies dearly bought, would say: \\u201cBrought back from an E pedition against the so-and-so!\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 As for Mme. Cottard, my father was astonished that Mme. Swann could find anything to be gained by getting so utterly undistinguished a woman to come to her house, and said: \\u201cIn spite of the Professor\\u2019s position, I must say that I cannot understand it.\\u201d Mamma, on the other hand, understood quite well; she knew that a great deal of the pleasure which a woman finds in entering a class of society different from that in which she has previously lived would be lacking if she had no means of keeping her old associates informed of those others, relatively more brilliant, with whom she has replaced them. Therefore, she requires an eye-witness who may be allowed to penetrate this new, delicious world as a buzzing, browsing insect bores its way into a flower and will then, as the course of her visits may carry her, spread abroad, or so at least one hopes, with the tidings, a latent germ of envy and of wonder. Mme. Cottard, who might have been created on purpose to fill this part, belonged to that special category in a visiting list which Mamma who inherited certain facets of her father\\u2019s turn of mind used to call the \\u2018Tell Sparta\\u2019 people. Besides \\u2014 apart from another reason which did not come to our knowledge until many years later \\u2014 Mme. Swann, in inviting this good-natured, reserved and modest friend, had no need to fear lest she might be  ducing into her drawing-room, on her brilliant \\u2018days,\\u2019 a traitor or a rival. She knew what a vast number of homely blossoms that busy worker, armed with her plume and card-case, could visit in a single afternoon. She knew the creature\\u2019s power of dissemination, and, basing her calculations upon the law of probability, was led to believe that almost certainly some intimate of the Verdurins would be bound to hear, within two or three days, how the Governor of Paris had left cards upon her, or that M. Verdurin himself would be told how M. Le Hault de Pressagny, the President of the Horse Show, had taken them, Swann and herself, to the King Theodosius gala; she imagined the Verdurins as informed of these two events, both so flattering to herself and of these alone, because the particular materialisations in which we embody and pursue fame are but few in number, by the default of our own minds which are incapable of imagining at one time all the forms which, none the less, we hope \\u2014 in a general way \\u2014 that fame will not fail simultaneously to assume for our benefit  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Mme. Swann had, however, met with no success outside what was called the \\u2018official world.\\u2019 Smart women did not go to her house. It was not the presence there of Republican \\u2018notables\\u2019 that frightened them away. In the days of my early childhood, conservative society was to the last degree worldly, and no \\u2018good\\u2019 house would ever have opened its doors to a Republican. The people who lived in such an atmosphere imagined that the impossibility of ever inviting an \\u2018opportunist\\u2019\\u2014 still more, a \\u2018horrid radical\\u2019\\u2014 to their parties was something that would endure for ever, like oil-lamps and horse-drawn omnibuses. But, like a kaleidoscope which is every now and then given a turn, society arranges successively in different orders elements which one would have supposed to be immovable, and composes a fresh pattern. Before I had made my first Communion, ladies on the \\u2018right side\\u2019 in politics had had the stupefaction of meeting, while paying calls, a smart Jewess. These new arrangements of the kaleidoscope are produced by what a philosopher would call a \\u2018change of criterion.\\u2019 The Dreyfus case brought about another, at a period rather later than that in which I began to go to Mme. Swann\\u2019s, and the kaleidoscope scattered once again its little scraps of colour. Everything Jewish, even the smart lady herself, fell out of the pattern, and various obscure nationalities appeared in its place. The most brilliant drawing-room in Paris was that of a Prince who was an Austrian and ultra-Catholic. If instead of the Dreyfus case there had come a war with Germany, the base of the kaleidoscope would have been turned in the other direction, and its pattern reversed. The Jews having shewn, to the general astonishment, that they were patriots also, would have kept their position, and no one would have cared to go any more, or even to admit that he had ever gone to the Austrian Prince\\u2019s. All this does not, however, prevent the people who move in it from imagining, whenever society is stationary for the moment, that no further change will occur, just as in spite of having witnessed the birth of the telephone they decline to believe in the aeroplane. Meanwhile the philosophers of journalism are at work, castigating the preceding epoch, and not only the kind of pleasures in which it indulged, which seem to them to be the last word in corruption, but even the work of its artists and philosophers, which have no longer the least value in their eyes, as though they were indissolubly linked to the successive moods of fashionable frivolity. The one thing that does not change is that at any and every time it appears that there have been \\u2018great changes.\\u2019 At the time when I went to Mme. Swann\\u2019s the Dreyfus storm had not yet broken, and some of the more prominent Jews were e tremely powerful. None more so than Sir Rufus Israels, whose wife, Lady Israels, was Swann\\u2019s aunt. She had not herself any intimate acquaintance so distinguished as her nephew\\u2019s, while he, since he did not care for her, had never much cultivated her society, although he was, so far as was known, her heir. But she was the only one of Swann\\u2019s relatives who had any idea of his social position, the others having always remained in the state of ignorance, in that respect, which had long been our own. When, from a family circle, one of its members emigrates into \\u2018high society\\u2019\\u2014 which to him appears a feat without parallel until after the lapse of a decade he observes that it has been performed in other ways and for different reasons by more than one of the men whom he knew as boys \\u2014 he draws round about himself a zone of shadow, a terra incognita, which is clearly visible in its minutest details to all those who inhabit it with him, but is darkest night and nothingness to those who may not penetrate it but touch its fringe without the least suspicion of its e istence in their midst. There being no news agency to furnish Swann\\u2019s lady cousins with intelligence of the people with whom he consorted, it was before his appalling marriage, of course with a smile of condescension that they would tell one another, over family dinner-tables, that they had spent a \\u2018virtuous\\u2019 Sunday in going to see \\u2018cousin Charles,\\u2019 whom regarding him as a \\u2018poor relation\\u2019 who was inclined to envy their prosperity, they used wittily to name, playing upon the title of Balzac\\u2019s story, Le Cousin B\\u00eate. Lady Israels, however, was letter-perfect in the names and quality of the people who lavished upon Swann a friendship of which she was frankly jealous. Her husband\\u2019s family, which almost equalled the Rothschilds in importance, had for several generations managed the affairs of the Orleans Princes. Lady Israels, being immensely rich, e ercised a wide influence, and had employed it so as to ensure that no one whom she knew should be \\u2018at home\\u2019 to Odette. One only had disobeyed her, in secret, the Comtesse de Marsantes. And then, as ill luck would have it, Odette having gone to call upon Mme. de Marsantes, Lady Israels had entered the room almost at her heels. Mme. de Marsantes was on tenter-hooks. With the craven impotence of those who are at liberty to act as they choose, she did not address a single word to Odette, who thus found little encouragement to press further the invasion of a world which, moreover, was not at all that into which she would have liked to be welcomed. In this complete detachment of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, Odette continued to be regarded as the illiterate \\u2018light woman,\\u2019 utterly different from the respectable ladies, \\u2018well up\\u2019 in all the minutest points of genealogy, who endeavoured to quench by reading biographies and memoirs their thirst for the aristocratic relations with which real life had omitted to provide them. And Swann, for his part, continued no doubt to be the lover in whose eyes all these peculiarities of an old mistress would appear lovable or at least inoffensive, for I have often heard his wife profess what were really social heresies, without his attempting whether from lingering affection for her, loss of regard for society or weariness of the effort to make her perfect to correct them. It was perhaps also another form of the simplicity which for so long had misled us at Combray, and which now had the effect that, while he continued to know, on his own account at least, many highly distinguished people, he did not make a point, in conversation in his wife\\u2019s drawing-room, of our seeming to feel that they were of the smallest importance. They had, indeed, less than ever for Swann, the centre of gravity of his life having been displaced. In any case, Odette\\u2019s ignorance of social distinctions was so dense that if the name of the Princesse de Guermantes were mentioned in conversation after that of the Duchess, her cousin, \\u201cSo those ones are Princes, are they?\\u201d she would e claim; \\u201cWhy, they\\u2019ve gone up a step.\\u201d Were anyone to say \\u201cthe Prince,\\u201d in speaking of the Duc de Chartres, she would put him right with, \\u201cThe Duke, you mean; he is Duc de Chartres, not Prince.\\u201d As for the Duc d\\u2019Orl\\u00e9ans, son of the Comte de Paris: \\u201cThat\\u2019s funny; the son is higher than the father!\\u201d she would remark, adding, for she was afflicted with anglomania, \\u201cThoseRoyalties are so dreadfully confusing!\\u201d\\u2014 while to someone who asked her from what province the Guermantes family came she replied, \\u201cFrom the Aisne.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 But, so far as Odette was concerned, Swann was quite blind, not merely to these deficiencies in her education but to the general mediocrity of her intelligence. More than that; whenever Odette repeated a silly story Swann would sit listening to his wife with a complacency, a merriment, almost an admiration into which some survival of his desire for her must have entered; while in the same conversation, anything subtle, anything deep even that he himself might say would be listened to by Odette with an habitual lack of interest, rather curtly, with impatience, and would at times be sharply contradicted. And we must conclude that this enslavement of refinement by vulgarity is the rule in many households, when we think, conversely, of all the superior women who yield to the blandishments of a boor, merciless in his censure of their most delicate utterances, while they go into ecstasies, with the infinite indulgence of love, over the feeblest of his witticisms. To return to the reasons which prevented Odette, at this period, from making her way into the Faubourg Saint-Germain, it must be observed that the latest turn of the social kaleidoscope had been actuated by a series of scandals. Women to whose houses one had been going with entire confidence had been discovered to be common prostitutes, if not British spies. One would, therefore, for some time to come e pect people so, at least, one supposed to be, before anything else, in a sound position, regular, settled, accountable. Odette represented simply everything with which one had just severed relations, and was incidentally to renew them at once for men, their natures not altering from day to day, seek in every new order a continuance of the old but to renew them by seeking it under another form which would allow one to be innocently taken in, and to believe that it was no longer the same society as before the disaster. However, the scapegoats of that society and Odette were too closely alike. People who move in society are very short-sighted; at the moment in which they cease to have any relations with the Israelite ladies whom they have known, while they are asking themselves how they are to fill the gap thus made in their lives, they perceive, thrust into it as by the windfall of a night of storm, a new lady, an Israelite also; but by virtue of her novelty she is not associated in their minds with her predecessors, with what they are convinced that they must abjure. She does not ask that they shall respect her God. They take her up. There was no question of anti-semitism at the time when I used first to visit Odette. But she was like enough to it to remind people of what they wished, for a while, to avoid  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 As for Swann himself, he was still a frequent visitor of several of his former acquaintance, who, of course, were all of the very highest rank. And yet when he spoke to us of the people whom he had just been to see I noticed that, among those whom he had known in the old days, the choice that he made was dictated by the same kind of taste, partly artistic, partly historic, that inspired him as a collector. And remarking that it was often some great lady or other of waning reputation, who interested him because she had been the mistress of Liszt or because one of Balzac\\u2019s novels was dedicated to her grandmother as he would purchase a drawing if Chateaubriand had written about it I conceived a suspicion that we had, at Combray, replaced one error, that of regarding Swann as a mere stockbroker, who did not go into society, by another, when we supposed him to be one of the smartest men in Paris. To be a friend of the Comte de Paris meant nothing at all. Is not the world full of such \\u2018friends of Princes,\\u2019 who would not be received in any house that was at all \\u2018e clusive\\u2019? Princes know themselves to be princes, and are not snobs; besides, they believe themselves to be so far above everything that is not of their blood royal that great nobles and \\u2018business men\\u2019 appear, in the depths beneath them, to be practically on a level  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 But Swann went farther than this; not content with seeking in society, such as it was, when he fastened upon the names which, inscribed upon its roll by the past, were still to be read there, a simple artistic and literary pleasure, he indulged in the slightly vulgar diversion of arranging as it were social nosegays by grouping heterogeneous elements, bringing together people taken at hazard, here, there and everywhere. These e periments in the lighter side or what was to Swann the lighter side of sociology did not stimulate an identical reaction, with any regularity, that is to say, in each of his wife\\u2019s friends. \\u201cI\\u2019m thinking of asking the Cottards to meet the Duchesse de Vend\\u00f4me,\\u201d he would laughingly say to Mme. Bontemps, in the appetised tone of an epicure who has thought of, and intends to try the substitution, in a sauce, of cayenne pepper for cloves. But this plan, which was, in fact, to appear quite humorous, in an archaic sense of the word, to the Cottards, had also the power of infuriating Mme. Bontemps. She herself had recently been presented by the Swanns to the Duchesse de Vend\\u00f4me, and had found this as agreeable as it seemed to her natural. The thought of winning renown from it at the Cottards\\u2019, when she related to them what had happened, had been by no means the least savoury ingredient of her pleasure. But like those persons recently decorated who, their investiture once accomplished, would like to see the fountain of honour turned off at the main, Mme. Bontemps would have preferred that, after herself, no one else in her own circle of friends should be made known to the Princess. She denounced to herself, of course the licentious taste of Swann who, in order to gratify a wretched aesthetic whim, was obliging her to scatter to the winds, at one swoop, all the dust that she would have thrown in the eyes of the Cottards when she told them about the Duchesse de Vend\\u00f4me. How was she even to dare to announce to her husband that the Professor and his wife were in their turn to partake of this pleasure, of which she had boasted to him as though it were unique. And yet, if the Cottards could only be made to know that they were being invited not seriously but for the amusement of their host! It is true that the Bontemps had been invited for the same reason, but Swann, having acquired from the aristocracy that eternal \\u2018Don Juan\\u2019 spirit which, in treating with two women of no importance, makes each of them believe that it is she alone who is seriously loved, had spoken to Mme. Bontemps of the Duchesse de Vend\\u00f4me as of a person whom it was clearly laid down that she must meet at dinner. \\u201cYes, we\\u2019re determined to have the Princess here with the Cottards,\\u201d said Mme. Swann a few weeks later; \\u201cMy husband thinks that we might get something quite amusing out of that conjunction.\\u201d For if she had retained from the \\u2018little nucleus\\u2019 certain habits dear to Mme. Verdurin, such as that of shouting things aloud so as to be heard by all the faithful, she made use, at the same time, of certain e pressions, such as \\u2018conjunction,\\u2019 which were dear to the Guermantes circle, of which she thus felt unconsciously and at a distance, as the sea is swayed by the moon, the attraction, though without being drawn perceptibly closer to it. \\u201cYes, the Cottards and the Duchesse de Vend\\u00f4me. Don\\u2019t you think that might be rather fun?\\u201d asked Swann. \\u201cI think they\\u2019ll be e ceedingly ill-assorted, and it can only lead to a lot of bother; people oughtn\\u2019t to play with fire, is what I say!\\u201d snapped Mme. Bontemps, furious. She and her husband were, all the same, invited, as was the Prince d\\u2019Agrigente, to this dinner, which Mme. Bontemps and Cottard had each two alternative ways of describing, according to whom they were telling about it. To one set Mme. Bontemps for her part, and Cottard for his would say casually, when asked who else had been of the party: \\u201cOnly the Prince d\\u2019Agrigente; it was all quite intimate.\\u201d But there were others who might, alas, be better informed once, indeed, some one had challenged Cottard with: \\u201cBut weren\\u2019t the Bontemps there too?\\u201d \\u201cOh, I forgot them,\\u201d Cottard had blushingly admitted to the tactless questioner whom he ever afterwards classified among slanderers and speakers of evil. For these the Bontemps and Cottards had each adopted, without any mutual arrangement, a version the framework of which was identical for both parties, their own names alone changing places. \\u201cLet me see;\\u201d Cottard would say, \\u201cthere were our host and hostess, the Due and Duchesse de Vend\\u00f4me \\u2014\\u201d with a satisfied smile \\u201cProfessor and Mme. Cottard, and, upon my soul, heaven only knows how they got there, for they were about as much in keeping as hairs in the soup, M. and Mme. Bontemps!\\u201d Mme. Bontemps would recite an e actly similar \\u2018piece,\\u2019 only it was M. and Mme. Bontemps who were named with a satisfied emphasis between the Duchesse de Vend\\u00f4me and the Prince d\\u2019Agrigente, while the \\u2018also ran,\\u2019 whom finally she used to accuse of having invited themselves, and who completely spoiled the party, were the Cottards  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 When he had been paying calls Swann would often come home with little time to spare before dinner. At that point in the evening, si  o\\u2019clock, when in the old days he had felt so wretched, he no longer asked himself what Odette might be about, and was hardly at all concerned to hear that she had people still with her, or had gone out. He recalled at times that he had once, years ago, tried to read through its envelope a letter addressed by Odette to Forcheville. But this memory was not pleasing to him, and rather than plumb the depth of shame that he felt in it he preferred to indulge in a little grimace, twisting up the corners of his mouth and adding, if need be, a shake of the head which signified \\u201cWhat does it all matter?\\u201d In truth, he considered now that the hypothesis by which he had often been brought to a standstill in days gone by, according to which it was his jealous imagination alone that blackened what was in reality the innocent life of Odette \\u2014 that this hypothesis which after all was beneficent, since, so long as his amorous malady had lasted, it had diminished his sufferings by making them seem imaginary was not the truth, that it was his jealousy that had seen things in the right light, and that if Odette had loved him better than he supposed, she had deceived him more as well. Formerly, while his sufferings were still keen, he had vowed that, as soon as he should have ceased to love Odette, and so to be afraid either of ve ing her or of making her believe that he loved her more than he did, he would afford himself the satisfaction of elucidating with her, simply from his love of truth and as a historical point, whether or not she had had Forcheville in her room that day when he had rung her bell and rapped on her window without being let in, and she had written to Forcheville that it was an uncle of hers who had called. But this so interesting problem, of which he was waiting to attempt the solution only until his jealousy should have subsided, had precisely lost all interest in Swann\\u2019s eyes when he had ceased to be jealous. Not immediately, however. He felt no other jealousy now with regard to Odette than what the memory of that day, that afternoon spent in knocking vainly at the little house in the Rue La P\\u00e9rouse, had continued to e cite in him; as though his jealousy, not dissimilar in that respect from those maladies which appear to have their seat, their centre of contagion less in certain persons than in certain places, in certain houses, had had for its object not so much Odette herself as that day, that hour in the irrevocable past when Swann had beaten at every entrance to her house in turn. You would have said that that day, that hour alone had caught and preserved a few last fragments of the amorous personality which had once been Swann\\u2019s, and that there alone could he now recapture them. For a long time now it had made no matter to him that Odette had been false to him, and was false still. And yet he had continued for some years to seek out old servants of Odette, so strongly in him persisted the painful curiosity to know whether on that day, so long ago, at si  o\\u2019clock, Odette had been in bed with Forcheville. Then that curiosity itself had disappeared, without, however, his abandoning his investigations. He continued the attempt to discover what no longer interested him, because his old ego though it had shrivelled to the e treme of decrepitude still acted mechanically, following the course of preoccupations so utterly abandoned that Swann could not now succeed even in forming an idea of that anguish \\u2014 so compelling once that he had been unable to foresee his ever being delivered from it, that only the death of her whom he loved death which, as will be shewn later on in this story, by a cruel e ample, in no way diminishes the sufferings caused by jealousy seemed to him capable of making smooth the road, then insurmountably barred to him, of his life  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 But to bring to light, some day, those passages in the life of Odette to which he owed his sufferings had not been Swann\\u2019s only ambition; he had in reserve that also of wreaking vengeance for his sufferings when, being no longer in love with Odette, he should no longer be afraid of her; and the opportunity of gratifying this second ambition had just occurred, for Swann was in love with another woman, a woman who gave him \\u2014 grounds for jealousy, no, but who did all the same make him jealous, because he was not capable, now, of altering his way of making love, and it was the way he had used with Odette that must serve him now for another. To make Swann\\u2019s jealousy revive it was not essential that this woman should be unfaithful, it sufficed that for any reason she was separated from him, at a party for instance, where she was presumably enjoying herself. That was enough to reawaken in him the old anguish, that lamentable and inconsistent e crescence of his love, which held Swann ever at a distance from what she really was, like a yearning to attain the impossible what this young woman really felt for him, the hidden longing that absorbed her days, the secret places of her heart, for between Swann and her whom he loved this anguish piled up an unyielding mass of already e isting suspicions, having their cause in Odette, or in some other perhaps who had preceded Odette, allowing this now ageing lover to know his mistress of the moment only in the traditional and collective phantasm of the \\u2018woman who made him jealous,\\u2019 in which he had arbitrarily incarnated his new love. Often, however, Swann would charge his jealousy with the offence of making him believe in imaginary infidelities; but then he would remember that he had given Odette the benefit of the same argument and had in that been wrong. And so everything that the young woman whom he loved did in those hours when he was not with her appeared spoiled of its innocence in his eyes. But whereas at that other time he had made a vow that if ever he ceased to love her whom he did not then imagine to be his future wife, he would implacably e hibit to her an indifference that would at length be sincere, so as to avenge his pride that had so long been trampled upon by her \\u2014 of those reprisals which he might now enforce without risk to himself for what harm could it do him to be taken at his word and deprived of those intimate moments with Odette that had been so necessary to him once, of those reprisals he took no more thought; with his love had vanished the desire to shew that he was in love no longer. And he who, when he was suffering at the hands of Odette, would have looked forward so keenly to letting her see one day that he had fallen to a rival, now that he was in a position to do so took infinite precautions lest his wife should suspect the e istence of this new love  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 * * *  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 It was not only in those tea-parties, on account of which I had formerly had the sorrow of seeing Gilberte leave me and go home earlier than usual, that I was henceforth to take part, but the engagements that she had with her mother, to go for a walk or to some afternoon party, which by preventing her from coming to the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es had deprived me of her, on those days when I loitered alone upon the lawn or stood before the wooden horses \\u2014 to these outings M. and Mme. Swann henceforth admitted me, I had a seat in their landau, and indeed it was me that they asked if I would rather go to the theatre, to a dancing lesson at the house of one of Gilberte\\u2019s friends, to some social gathering given by friends of her parents what Odette called \\u2018a little meeting\\u2019 or to visit the tombs at Saint-Denis  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 On days when I was going anywhere with the Swanns I would arrive at the house in time for d\\u00e9jeuner, which Mme. Swann called \\u2018le lunch\\u2019; as one was not e pected before half-past twelve, while my parents in those days had their meal at a quarter past eleven, it was not until they had risen from the table that I made my way towards that sumptuous quarter, deserted enough at any hour, but more particularly just then, when everyone had gone indoors. Even on winter days of frost, if the weather held, tightening every few minutes the knot of a gorgeous necktie from Charvet\\u2019s and looking to see that my varnished boots were not getting dirty, I would roam to and fro among the avenues, waiting until twenty-seven minutes past the hour. I could see from afar in the Swanns\\u2019 little garden-plot the sunlight glittering like hoar frost from the bare-boughed trees. It is true that the garden boasted but a pair of them. The unusual hour presented the scene in a new light. Into these pleasures of nature intensified by the suppression of habit and indeed by my physical hunger the thrilling prospect of sitting down to luncheon with Mme. Swann was infused; it did not diminish them, but taking command of them trained them to its service; so that if, at this hour when ordinarily I did not perceive them, I seemed now to be discovering the fine weather, the cold, the wintry sunlight, it was all as a sort of preface to the creamed eggs, as a patina, a cool and coloured glaze applied to the decoration of that mystic chapel which was the habitation of Mme. Swann, and in the heart of which there were, by contrast, so much warmth, so many scents and flowers  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 At half-past twelve I would finally make up my mind to enter that house which, like an immense Christmas stocking, seemed ready to bestow upon me supernatural delights. The French name \\u2018No\\u00ebl\\u2019 was, by the way, unknown to Mme. Swann and Gilberte, who had substituted for it the English \\u2018Christmas,\\u2019 and would speak of nothing but \\u2018Christmas pudding,\\u2019 what people had given them as \\u2018Christmas presents\\u2019 and of going away \\u2014 the thought of which maddened me with grief \\u2014\\u2018for Christmas.\\u2019 At home even, I should have thought it degrading to use the word \\u2018No\\u00ebl,\\u2019 and always said \\u2018Christmas,\\u2019 which my father considered e tremely silly.  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 I encountered no one at first but a footman who after leading me through several large drawing-rooms shewed me into one that was quite small, empty, its windows beginning to dream already in the blue light of afternoon; I was left alone there in the company of orchids, roses and violets, which, like people who are kept waiting in a room beside you but do not know you, preserved a silence which their individuality as living things made all the more impressive, and received coldly the warmth of a glowing fire of coals, preciously displayed behind a screen of crystal, in a basin of white marble over which it spilled, now and again, its perilous rubies  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 I had sat down, but I rose hurriedly on hearing the door opened; it was only another footman, and then a third, and the minute result chat their vainly alarming entrances and e its achieved was to put a little more coal on the fire or water in the vases. They departed, I found myself alone, once that door was shut which Mme. Swann was surely soon going to open. Of a truth, I should have been less ill at ease in a magician\\u2019s cave than in this little waiting-room where the fire appeared to me to be performing alchemical transmutations as in Klingsor\\u2019s laboratory. Footsteps sounded afresh, I did not rise, it was sure to be just another footman; it was M. Swann. \\u201cWhat! All by yourself? What is one to do; that poor wife of mine has never been able to remember what time means! Ten minutes to one. She gets later every day. And you\\u2019ll see, she will come sailing in without the least hurry, and imagine she\\u2019s in heaps of time.\\u201d And as he was still subject to neuritis, and as he was becoming a trifle ridiculous, the fact of possessing so unpunctual a wife, who came in so late from the Bois, forgot everything at her dressmaker\\u2019s and was never in time for luncheon made Swann an ious for his digestion but flattered his self-esteem  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 He shewed me his latest acquisitions and e plained their interest to me, but my emotion, added to the unfamiliarity of being still without food at this hour, sweeping through my mind left it void, so that while able to speak I was incapable of hearing. Anyhow, so far as the works of art in Swann\\u2019s possession were concerned, it was enough for me that they were contained in his house, formed a part there of the delicious hour that preceded luncheon. The Gioconda herself might have appeared there without giving me any more pleasure than one of Mme. Swann\\u2019s indoor gowns, or her scent bottles  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 I continued to wait, alone or with Swann, and often with Gilberte, come in to keep us company. The arrival of Mme. Swann, prepared for me by all those majestic apparitions, must so it seemed to me be something truly immense. I strained my ears to catch the slightest sound. But one never finds quite as high as one has been e pecting a cathedral, a wave in a storm, a dancer\\u2019s leap in the air; after those liveried footmen, suggesting the  whose processional entry upon the stage leads up to and at the same time diminishes the final appearance of the queen, Mme. Swann, creeping furtively in, with a little otter-skin coat, her veil lowered to cover a nose pink-tipped by the cold, did not fulfil the promises lavished, while I had been waiting, upon my imagination  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0But if she had stayed at home all morning, when she arrived in the drawing-room she would be clad in a wrapper of cr\\u00eape-de-Chine, brightly coloured, which seemed to me more e quisite than any of her dresses  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Sometimes the Swanns decided to remain in the house all afternoon, and then, as we had had luncheon so late, very soon I must watch setting, beyond the garden-wall, the sun of that day which had seemed to me bound to be different from other days; then in vain might the servants bring in lamps of every size and shape, burning each upon the consecrated altar of a console, a card-table, a corner-cupboard, a bracket, as though for the celebration of some strange and secret rite; nothing e traordinary transpired in the conversation, and I went home disappointed, as one often is in one\\u2019s childhood after the midnight mass  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 But my disappointment was scarcely more than mental. I was radiant with happiness in this house where Gilberte, when she was still not with us, was about to appear and would bestow on me in a moment, and for hours to come, her speech, her smiling and attentive gaze, just as I had caught it, that first time, at Combray. At the most I was a trifle jealous when I saw her so often disappear into vast rooms above, reached by a private staircase. Obliged myself to remain in the drawing-room, like a man in love with an actress who is confined to his stall \\u2018in front\\u2019 and wonders an iously what is going on behind the scenes, in the green-room, I put to Swann, with regard to this other part of the house questions artfully veiled, but in a tone from which I could not quite succeed in banishing the note of uneasiness. He e plained to me that the place to which Gilberte had gone was the linen-room, offered himself to shew it to me, and promised me that whenever Gilberte Had occasion to go there again he would insist upon her taking me with her. By these last words and the relief which they brought me Swann at once annihilated for me one of those terrifying interior perspectives at the end of which a woman with whom we are in love appears so remote. At that moment I felt for him an affection which I believed to be deeper than my affection for Gilberte. For he, being the master over his daughter, was giving her to me, whereas she, she withheld herself now and then, I had not the same direct control over her as I had indirectly through Swann. Besides, it was she whom I loved and could not, therefore look upon without that disturbance, without that desire for something more which destroys in us, in the presence of one whom we love, the sensation of loving  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 As a rule, however, we did not stay indoors, we went out. Sometimes, before going to dress, Mme. Swann would sit down at the piano. Her lovely hands, escaping from the pink, or white, or, often, vividly coloured sleeves of her cr\\u00eape-de-Chine wrapper, drooped over the keys with that same melancholy which was in her eyes but was not in her heart. It was on one of those days that she happened to play me the part of Vinteuil\\u2019s sonata that contained the little phrase of which Swann had been so fond. But often one listens and hears nothing, if it is a piece of music at all complicated to which one is listening for the first time. And yet when, later on, this sonata had been played over to me two or three times I found that I knew it quite well. And so it is not wrong to speak of hearing a thing for the first time. If one had indeed, as one supposes, received no impression from the first hearing, the second, the third would be equally \\u2018first hearings\\u2019 and there would be no reason why one should understand it any better after the tenth. Probably what is wanting, the first time, is not comprehension but memory. For our memory, compared to the comple ity of the impressions which it has to face while we are listening, is infinitesimal, as brief as the memory of a man who in his sleep thinks of a thousand things and at once forgets them, or as that of a man in his second childhood who cannot recall, a minute afterwards, what one has just been saying to him. Of these multiple impressions our memory is not capable of furnishing us with an immediate picture. But that picture gradually takes shape, and, with regard to works which we have heard more than once, we are like the schoolboy who has read several times over before going to sleep a lesson which he supposed himself not to know, and finds that he can repeat it by heart ne t morning. It was only that I had not, until then, heard a note of the sonata, whereas Swann and his wife could make out a distinct phrase that was as far beyond the range of my perception as a name which one endeavours to recall and in place of which one discovers only a void, a void from which, an hour later, when one is not thinking about them, will spring of their own accord, in one continuous flight, the syllables that one has solicited in vain. And not only does one not seize at once and retain an impression of works that are really great, but even in the content of any such work as befell me in the case of Vinteuil\\u2019s sonata it is the least valuable parts that one at first perceives. Thus it was that I was mistaken not only in thinking that this work held nothing further in store for me so that for a long time I made no effort to hear it again from the moment in which Mme. Swann had played over to me its most famous passage; I was in this respect as stupid as people are who e pect to feel no astonishment when they stand in Venice before the front of Saint Mark\\u2019s, because photography has already acquainted them with the outline of its domes. Far more than that, even when I had heard the sonata played from beginning to end, it remained almost wholly invisible to me, like a monument of which its distance or a haze in the atmosphere allows us to catch but a faint and fragmentary glimpse. Hence the depression inseparable from one\\u2019s knowledge of such works, as of everything that acquires reality in time. When the least obvious beauties of Vinteuil\\u2019s sonata were revealed to me, already, borne by the force of habit beyond the reach of my sensibility, those that I had from the first distinguished and preferred in it were beginning to escape, to avoid me. Since I was able only in successive moments to enjoy all the pleasures that this sonata gave me, I never possessed it in its entirety: it was like life itself. But, less disappointing than life is, great works of art do not begin by giving us all their best. In Vinteuil\\u2019s sonata the beauties that one discovers at once are those also of which one most soon grows tired, and for the same reason, no doubt, namely that they are less different from what one already knows. But when those first apparitions have withdrawn, there is left for our enjoyment some passage which its composition, too new and strange to offer anything but confusion to our mind, had made indistinguishable and so preserved intact; and this, which we have been meeting every day and have not guessed it, which has thus been held in reserve for us, which by the sheer force of its beauty has become invisible and has remained unknown, this comes to us last of all. But this also must be the last that we shall relinquish. And we shall love it longer than the rest because we have taken longer to get to love it. The time, moreover, that a person requires \\u2014 as I required in the matter of this sonata \\u2014 to penetrate a work of any depth is merely an epitome, a symbol, one might say, of the years, the centuries even that must elapse before the public can begin to cherish a masterpiece that is really new. So that the man of genius, to shelter himself from the ignorant contempt of the world, may say to himself that, since one\\u2019s contemporaries are incapable of the necessary detachment, works written for posterity should be read by posterity alone, like certain pictures which one cannot appreciate when one stands too close to them. But, as it happens, any such cowardly precaution to avoid false judgments is doomed to failure; they are inevitable. The reason for which a work of genius is not easily admired from the first is that the man who has created it is e traordinary, that few other men resemble him. It was Beethoven\\u2019s Quartets themselves the Twelfth, Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth that devoted half a century to forming, fashioning and enlarging a public for Beethoven\\u2019s Quartets, marking in this way, like every great work of art, an advance if not in artistic merit at least in intellectual society, largely composed to-day of what was not to be found when the work first appeared, that is to say of persons capable of enjoying it. What artists call posterity is the posterity of the work of art. It is essential that the work leaving out of account, for brevity\\u2019s sake, the contingency that several men of genius may at the same time be working along parallel lines to create a more instructed public in the future, a public from which other men of genius shall reap the benefit shall create its own posterity. For if the work were held in reserve, were revealed only to posterity, that audience, for that particular work, would be not posterity but a group of contemporaries who were merely living half-a-century later in time. And so it is essential that the artist and this is what Vinteuil had done, if he wishes his work to be free to follow its own course, shall launch it, wherever he may find sufficient depth, confidently outward bound towards the future. And yet this interval of time, the true perspective in which to behold a work of art, if leaving it out of account is the mistake made by bad judges, taking it into account is at times a dangerous precaution of the good. No doubt one can easily imagine, by an illusion similar to that which makes everything on the horizon appear equidistant, that all the revolutions which have hitherto occurred in painting or in music did at least shew respect for certain rules, whereas that which immediately confronts us, be it impressionism, a striving after discord, an e clusive use of the Chinese scale, cubism, futurism or what you will, differs outrageously from all that have occurred before. Simply because those that have occurred before we are apt to regard as a whole, forgetting that a long process of assimilation has melted them into a continuous substance, varied of course but, taking it as a whole, homogeneous, in which Hugo blends with Moli\\u00e8re. Let us try to imagine the shocking incoherence that we should find, if we did not take into account the future, and the changes that it must bring about, in a horoscope of our own riper years, drawn and presented to us in our youth. Only horoscopes are not always accurate, and the necessity, when judging a work of art, of including the temporal factor in the sum total of its beauty  duces, to our way of thinking, something as hazardous, and consequently as barren of interest, as every prophecy the non-fulfilment of which will not at all imply any inadequacy on the prophet\\u2019s part, for the power to summon possibilities into e istence or to e clude them from it is not necessarily within the competence of genius; one may have had genius and yet not have believed in the future of railways or of flight, or, although a brilliant psychologist, in the infidelity of a mistress or of a friend whose treachery persons far less gifted would have foreseen  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 If I did not understand the sonata, it enchanted me to hear Mme. Swann play. Her touch appeared to me like her wrappers, like the scent of her staircase, her cloaks, her chrysanthemums to form part of an individual and mysterious whole, in a world infinitely superior to that in which the mind is capable of analysing talent. \\u201cAttractive, isn\\u2019t it, that Vinteuil sonata?\\u201d Swann asked me. \\u201cThe moment when night is darkening among the trees, when the arpeggios of the violin call down a cooling dew upon the earth. You must admit that it is rather charming; it shews all the static side of moonlight, which is the essential part. It is not surprising that a course of radiant heat such as my wife is taking, should act on the muscles, since moonlight can prevent the leaves from stirring. That is what he e presses so well in that little phrase, the Bois de Boulogne plunged in a cataleptic trance. By the sea it is even more striking, because you have there the faint response of the waves, which, of course, you can hear quite distinctly, since nothing else dares to move. In Paris it is the other way; at the most, you may notice unfamiliar lights among the old buildings, the sky brightened as though by a colourless and harmless conflagration, that sort of vast variety show of which you get a hint here and there. But in Vinteuil\\u2019s little phrase, and in the whole sonata for that matter, it is not like that; the scene is laid in the Bois; in the gruppetto you can distinctly hear a voice saying: \\u2018I can almost see to read the paper!\\u2019\\u201d These words from Swann might have falsified, later on, my impression of the sonata, music being too little e clusive to inhibit absolutely what other people suggest that we should find in it. But I understood from other words which he let fall that this nocturnal foliage was simply that beneath whose shade in many a restaurant on the outskirts of Paris he had listened on many an evening to the little phrase. In place of the profound significance that he had so often sought in it, what it recalled now to Swann were the leafy boughs, arranged, wreathed, painted round about it which it gave him the desire to see again because it seemed to him to be their inner, their hidden self, as it were their soul; was the whole of one spring season which he had not been able to enjoy before, not having had \\u2014 feverish and moody as he then was \\u2014 enough strength of body and mind for its enjoyment, which, as one puts by for an invalid the dainties that he has not been able to eat, it had kept in store for him. The charm that he had been made to feel by certain evenings in the Bois, a charm of which Vinteuil\\u2019s sonata served to remind him, he could not have recaptured by questioning Odette, although she, as well as the little phrase, had been his companion there. But Odette had been merely his companion, by his side, not as the phrase had been within him, and so had seen nothing \\u2014 nor would she, had she been a thousand times as comprehending, have seen anything of that vision which for no one among us or at least I was long under the impression that this rule admitted no e ception can be made e ternally visible. \\u201cIt is rather charming, don\\u2019t you think,\\u201d Swann continued, \\u201cthat sound can give a reflection, like water, or glass. It is curious, too, that Vinteuil\\u2019s phrase now shews me only the things to which I paid no attention then. Of my troubles, my loves of those days it recalls nothing, it has altered all my values.\\u201d \\u201cCharles, I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s very polite to me, what you\\u2019re saying.\\u201d \\u201cNot polite? Really, you women are superb! I was simply trying to e plain to this young man that what the music shews \\u2014 to me, at least \\u2014 is not for a moment \\u2018Free-will\\u2019 or \\u2018In Tune with the Infinite,\\u2019 but shall we say old Verdurin in his frock coat in the palm-house at the Jardin d\\u2019Acclimatation. Hundreds of times, without my leaving this room, the little phrase has carried me off to dine with it at Armenonville. Gad, it is less boring, anyhow, than having to go there with Mme. de Cambremer.\\u201d Mme. Swann laughed. \\u201cThat is a lady who is supposed to have been violently in love with Charles,\\u201d she e plained, in the same tone in which, shortly before, when we were speaking of Vermeer of Delft, of whose e istence I had been surprised to find her conscious, she had answered me with: \\u201cI ought to e plain that M. Swann was very much taken up with that painter at the time he was courting me. Isn\\u2019t that so, Charles dear?\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re not to start saying things about Mme. de Cambremer!\\u201d Swann checked her, secretly flattered. \\u201cBut I\\u2019m only repeating what I\\u2019ve been told. Besides, it seems that she\\u2019s an e tremely clever woman; I don\\u2019t know her myself. I believe she\\u2019s very pushing, which surprises me rather in a clever woman. But everyone says that she was quite mad about you; there\\u2019s no harm in repeating that.\\u201d Swann remained silent as a deaf-mute which was in a way a confirmation of what she had said, and a proof of his own fatuity. \\u201cSince what I\\u2019m playing reminds you of the Jardin d\\u2019Acclimatation,\\u201d his wife went on, with a playful semblance of being offended, \\u201cwe might take him there some day in the carriage, if it would amuse him. It\\u2019s lovely there just now, and you can recapture your fond impressions! Which reminds me, talking of the Jardin d\\u2019Acclimatation, do you know, this young man thought that we were devotedly attached to a person whom I cut, as a matter of fact, whenever I possibly can, Mme. Blatin! I think it is rather crushing for us, that she should be taken for a friend of ours. Just fancy, dear Dr. Cottard, who never says a harsh word about anyone, declares that she\\u2019s positively contagious.\\u201d \\u201cA frightful woman! The one thing to be said for her is that she is e actly like Savonarola. She is the very image of that portrait of Savonarola, by Fra Bartolomeo.\\u201d This mania which Swann had for finding likenesses to people in pictures was defensible, for even what we call individual e pression is \\u2014 as we so painfully discover when we are in love and would fain believe in the unique reality of the beloved \\u2014 something diffused and general, which can be found e isting at different periods. But if one had listened to Swann, the processions of the Kings of the East, already so anachronistic when Benozzo Gozzoli  duced in their midst various Medici, would have been even more so, since they would have included the portraits of a whole crowd of men, contemporaries not of Gozzoli but of Swann, subsequent, that is to say not only by fifteen centuries to the Nativity but by four more to the painter himself. There was not missing from those trains, according to Swann, a single living Parisian of any note, any more than there was from that act in one of Sardou\\u2019s plays, in which, out of friendship for the author and for the leading lady, and also because it was the fashion, all the best known men in Paris, famous doctors, politicians, barristers, amused themselves, each on a different evening, by \\u2018walking on.\\u2019 \\u201cBut what has she got to do with the Jardin d\\u2019Acclimatation?\\u201d \\u201cEverything!\\u201d \\u201cWhat? You don\\u2019t suggest that she\\u2019s got a sky-blue behind, like the monkeys?\\u201d \\u201cCharles, you really are too dreadful! I was thinking of what the Cingalese said to her. Do tell him, Charles; it really is a gem.\\u201d \\u201cOh, it\\u2019s too silly. You know, Mme. Blatin loves asking people questions, in a tone which she thinks friendly, but which is really overpowering.\\u201d \\u201cWhat our good friends on the Thames call \\u2018patronising,\\u2019\\u201d interrupted Odette. \\u201cE actly. Well, she went the other day to the Jardin d\\u2019Acclimatation, where they have some blackamoors \\u2014 Cingalese, I think I heard my wife say; she is much \\u2018better up\\u2019 in ethnology than I am.\\u201d \\u201cNow, Charles, you\\u2019re not to make fun of poor me.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cI\\u2019ve no intention of making fun, I assure you. Well, to continue, she went up to one of these black fellows with \\u2018Good morning, nigga!\\u2019 . . . \\u201d \\u201cOh, it\\u2019s too absurd!\\u201d \\u201cAnyhow, this classification seems to have displeased the black. \\u2018Me nigga,\\u2019 he shouted quite furious, don\\u2019t you know, to Mme. Blatin, \\u2018me nigga; you, old cow!\\u2019\\u201d \\u201cI do think that\\u2019s so delightful! I adore that story. Do say it\\u2019s a good one. Can\\u2019t you see old Blatin standing there, and hearing him: \\u2018Me nigga; you, old cow\\u2019?\\u201d I e pressed an intense desire to go there and see these Cingalese, one of whom had called Mme. Blatin an old cow. They did not interest me in the least. But I reflected that in going to the Jardin d\\u2019Acclimatation, and again on our way home, we should pass along that All\\u00e9e des Acacias in which I had loved so, once, to gaze on Mme. Swann, and that perhaps Coquelin\\u2019s mulatto friend, to whom I had never managed to e hibit myself in the act of saluting her, would see me there, seated at her side, as the victoria swept by  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 During those minutes in which Gilberte, having gone to \\u2018get ready,\\u2019 was not in the room with us, M. and Mme. Swann would take delight in revealing to me all the rare virtues of their child. And everything that I myself observed seemed to prove the truth of what they said. I remarked that, as her mother had told me, she had not only for her friends but for the servants, for the poor, the most delicate attentions carefully thought out, a desire to give pleasure, a fear of causing annoyance, translated into all sorts of trifling actions which must often have meant great inconvenience to her. She had done some \\u2018work\\u2019 for our stall-keeper in the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es, and went out in the snow to give it to her with her own hands, so as not to lose a day. \\u201cYou have no idea how kind-hearted she is, she won\\u2019t let it be seen,\\u201d her father assured me. Young as she was, she appeared far more sensible already than her parents. When Swann boasted of his wife\\u2019s grand friends Gilberte would turn away, and remain silent, but without any air of reproaching him, for it seemed inconceivable to her that her father could be subjected to the slightest criticism. One day, when I had spoken to her of Mlle. Vinteuil, she said to me:  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cI shall never know her, for a very good reason, and that is that she was not nice to her father, by what one hears, she gave him a lot of trouble. You can\\u2019t understand that any more than I, can you; I\\u2019m sure you could no more live without your papa than I could, which is quite natural after all. How can one ever forget a person one has loved all one\\u2019s life?\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 And once when she was making herself particularly endearing to Swann, as I mentioned this to her when he was out of the room:  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cYes, poor Papa, it is the anniversary of his father\\u2019s death, just now. You can understand what he must be feeling; you do understand, don\\u2019t you; you and I feel the same about things like that. So I just try to be a little less naughty than usual.\\u201d \\u201cBut he doesn\\u2019t ever think you naughty. He thinks you\\u2019re quite perfect.\\u201d \\u201cPoor Papa, that\\u2019s because he\\u2019s far too good himself.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 But her parents were not content with singing the praises of Gilberte \\u2014 that same Gilberte, who, even, before I had set eyes on her, used to appear to me standing before a church, in a landscape of the He de France, and later, awakening in me not dreams now but memories, was embowered always in a hedge of pink hawthorn, in the little lane that I took when I was going the M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise way. Once when I had asked Mme. Swann and had made an effort to assume the indifferent tone of a friend of the family, curious to know the preferences of a child, which among all her playmates Gilberte liked the best, Mme. Swann replied: \\u201cBut you ought to know a great deal better than I do. You are in her confidence, her great favourite, her \\u2018chum,\\u2019 as the English say.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 It appears that in a coincidence as perfect as this was, when reality is folded over to cover the ideal of which we have so long been dreaming, it completely hides that ideal, absorbing it in itself, as when two geometrical figures that are congruent are made to coincide, so that there is but one, whereas we would rather, so as to give its full significance to our enjoyment, preserve for all those separate points of our desire, at the very moment in which we succeed in touching them, and so as to be quite certain that they are indeed themselves, the distinction of being intangible. And our thought cannot even reconstruct the old state so as to confront the new with it, for it has no longer a clear field: the acquaintance that we have made, the memory of those first, unhoped-for moments, the talk to which we have listened are there now to block the passage of our consciousness, and as they control the outlets of our memory far more than those of our imagination, they react more forcibly upon our past, which we are no longer able to visualise without taking them into account, than upon the form, still unshaped, of our future. I had been able to believe, year after year, that the right to visit Mme. Swann was a vague and fantastic privilege to which I should never attain; after I had spent a quarter of an hour in her drawing-room, it was the period in which I did not yet know her that was become fantastic and vague like a possibility which the realisation of an alternative possibility has made impossible. How was I ever to dream again of her dining-room as of an inconceivable place, when I could not make the least movement in my mind without crossing the path of that ine tinguishable ray cast backwards to infinity, even ino my own most distant past, by the lobster \\u00e0 l\\u2019Am\\u00e9ricaine which I had just been eating? And Swann must have observed in his own case a similar phenomenon; for this house in which he entertained me might be regarded as the place into which had flowed, to coincide and be lost in one another, not only the ideal dwelling that my imagination had constructed, but another still, that which his jealous love, as inventive as any fantasy of mine, had so often depicted to him, that dwelling common to Odette and himself which had appeared so inaccessible once, on evenings when Odette had taken him home with Forcheville to drink orangeade with her; and what had flowed in to be absorbed, for him, in the walls and furniture of the dining-room in which we now sat down to luncheon was that unhoped-for paradise in which, in the old days, he could not without a pang imagine that he would one day be saying to their butler those very words, \\u201cIs Madame ready yet?\\u201d which I now heard him utter with a touch of impatience mingled with self-satisfaction. No more than, probably, Swann himself could I succeed in knowing my own happiness, and when Gilberte once broke out: \\u201cWho would ever have said that the little girl you watched playing prisoners\\u2019 base, without daring to speak to her, would one day be your greatest friend, and you would go to her house whenever you liked?\\u201d she spoke of a change the occurrence of which I could verify only by observing it from without, finding no trace of it within myself, for it was composed of two separate states on both of which I could not, without their ceasing to be distinct from one another, succeed in keeping my thoughts fi ed at one and the same time  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 And yet this house, because it had been so passionately desired by Swann, must have kept for him some of its attraction, if I was to judge by myself for whom it had not lost all its mystery. That singular charm in which I had for so long supposed the life of the Swanns to be bathed I had not completely e orcised from their house on making my own way into it; I had made it, that charm, recoil, overpowered as it must be by the sight of the stranger, the pariah that I had been, to whom now Mme. Swann pushed forward graciously for him to sit in it an armchair e quisite, hostile, scandalised; but all round me that charm, in my memory, I can still distinguish. Is it because, on those days on which M. and Mme. Swann invited me to luncheon, to go out afterwards with them and Gilberte, I imprinted with my gaze \\u2014 while I sat waiting for them there alone \\u2014 on the carpet, the sofas, the tables, the screens, the pictures, the idea engraved upon my mind that Mme. Swann, or her husband, or Gilberte was about to enter the room? Is it because those objects have dwelt ever since in my memory side by side with the Swanns, and have gradually acquired something of their personal character? Is it because, knowing that the Swanns passed their e istence among all those things, I made of all of them as it were emblems of the private lives, of those habits of the Swanns from which I had too long been e cluded for them not to continue to appear strange to me, even when I was allowed the privilege of sharing in them? However it may be, always when I think of that drawing-room which Swann not that the criticism implied on his part any intention to find fault with his wife\\u2019s taste found so incongruous \\u2014 because, while it was still planned and carried out in the style, half conservatory, half studio, which had been that of the rooms in which he had first known Odette, she had, none the less, begun to replace in its medley a quantity of the Chinese ornaments, which she now felt to be rather gimcrack, a trifle dowdy, by a swarm of little chairs and stools and things upholstered in old Louis XIV silks; not to mention the works of art brought by Swann himself from his house on the Quai d\\u2019Orl\\u00e9ans \\u2014 it has kept in my memory, on the contrary, that composite, heterogeneous room, a cohesion, a unity, an individual charm never possessed even by the most complete, the least spoiled of such collections that the past has bequeathed to us, or the most modern, alive and stamped with the imprint of a living personality; for we alone can, by our belief that they have an e istence of their own, give to certain of the things that we see a soul which they afterwards keep, which they develop in our minds. All the ideas that I had formed of the hours, different from those that e ist for other men, passed by the Swanns in that house which was to their life what the body is to the soul, and must give e pression to its singularity, all those ideas were rearranged, amalgamated \\u2014 equally disturbing and indefinite throughout \\u2014 in the arrangement of the furniture, the thickness of the carpets, the position of the windows, the ministrations of the servants. When, after luncheon, we went in the sunshine to drink our coffee in the great bay window of the drawing-room, while Mme. Swann was asking me how many lumps of sugar I took, it was not only the silk-covered stool which she pushed towards me that emitted, with the agonising charm that I had long ago felt \\u2014 first among the pink hawthorn and then beside the clump of laurels \\u2014 in the name of Gilberte, the hostility that her parents had shewn to me, which this little piece of furniture seemed to have so well understood, to have so completely shared that I felt myself unworthy, and found myself almost reluctant to set my feet on its defenceless cushion; a personality, a soul was latent there which linked it secretly to the light of two o\\u2019clock in the afternoon, so different from any other light, in the gulf in which there played about our feet its sparkling tide of gold out of which the bluish crags of sofas and vaporous carpet beaches emerged like enchanted islands; and there was nothing, even to the painting by Rubens hung above the chimney-piece, that was not endowed with the same quality and almost the same intensity of charm as the laced boots of M. Swann, and that hooded cape, the like of which I had so dearly longed to wear, whereas now Odette would beg her husband to go and put on another, so as to appear more smart, whenever I did them the honour of driving out with them. She too went away to change her dress \\u2014 not heeding my protestations that no \\u2018outdoor\\u2019 clothes could be nearly so becoming as the marvellous garment of cr\\u00eape-de-Chine or silk, old rose, cherry-coloured, Tiepolo pink, white, mauve, green, red or yellow, plain or patterned, in which Mme. Swann had sat down to luncheon and which she was now going to take off. When I assured her that she ought to go out in that costume, she laughed, either in scorn of my ignorance or from delight in my compliment. She apologised for having so many wrappers, e plaining that they were the only kind of dress in which she felt comfortable, and left us, to go and array herself in one of those regal toilets which imposed their majesty on all beholders, and yet among which I was sometimes summoned to decide which of them I preferred that she should put on  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 In the Jardin d\\u2019Acclimatation, how proud I was when we had left the carriage to be walking by the side of Mme. Swann! While she strolled carelessly on, letting her cloak stream on the air behind her, I kept eyeing her with an admiring gaze to which she coquettishly responded in a lingering smile. And now, were we to meet one or other of Gilberte\\u2019s friends, boy or girl, who saluted us from afar, I would in my turn be looked upon by them as one of those happy creatures whose lot I had envied, one of those friends of Gilberte who knew her family and had a share in that other part of her life, the part which was not spent in the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Often upon the paths of the Bois or the Jardin we passed, we were greeted by some great lady who was Swann\\u2019s friend, whom he perchance did not see, so that his wife must rally him with a \\u201cCharles! Don\\u2019t you see Mme. de Montmorency?\\u201d And Swann, with that amicable smile, bred of a long and intimate friendship, bared his head, but with a slow sweeping gesture, with a grace peculiarly his own. Sometimes the lady would stop, glad of an opportunity to shew Mme. Swann a courtesy which would involve no tiresome consequences, by which they all knew that she would never seek to profit, so thoroughly had Swann trained her in reserve. She had none the less acquired all the manners of polite society, and however smart, however stately the lady might be, Mme. Swann was invariably a match for her; halting for a moment before the friend whom her husband had recognised and was addressing, she would  duce us, Gilberte and myself, with so much ease of manner, would remain so free, so tranquil in her e ercise of courtesy, that it would have been hard to say, looking at them both, which of the two was the aristocrat. The day on which we went to inspect the Cingalese, on our way home we saw coming in our direction, and followed by two others who seemed to be acting as her escort, an elderly but still attractive woman cloaked in a dark mantle and capped with a little bonnet tied beneath her chin with a pair of ribbons. \\u201cAh! Here is someone who will interest you!\\u201d said Swann. The old lady, who had come within a few yards of us, now smiled at us with a caressing sweetness. Swann doffed his hat. Mme. Swann swept to the ground in a curtsey and made as if to kiss the hand of the lady, who, standing there like a Winterhalter portrait, drew her up again and kissed her cheek. \\u201cThere, there; will you put your hat on, you!\\u201d she scolded Swann in a thick and almost growling voice, speaking like an old and familiar friend. \\u201cI am going to present you to Her Imperial Highness,\\u201d Mme. Swann whispered. Swann drew me aside for a moment while his wife talked of the weather and of the animals recently added to the Jardin d\\u2019Acclimatation, with the Princess. \\u201cThat is the Princesse Mathilde,\\u201d he told me; \\u201cyou know who\\u2019 I mean, the friend of Flaubert, Sainte-Beuve, Dumas. Just fancy, she\\u2019s the niece of Napoleon I. She had offers of marriage from Napoleon III and the Emperor of Russia. Isn\\u2019t that interesting? Talk to her a little. But I hope she won\\u2019t keep us standing here for an hour! . . . I met Taine the other day,\\u201d he went on, addressing the Princess, \\u201cand he told me that your Highness was ve ed with him.\\u201d \\u201cHe\\u2019s behaved like a perfect peeg!\\u201d she said gruffly, pronouncing the word cochon as though she referred to Joan of Arc\\u2019s contemporary, Bishop Cauchon. \\u201cAfter his article on the Emperor I left my card on him with p. p. c. on it.\\u201d I felt the surprise that one feels on opening the Correspondence of that Duchesse d\\u2019Orl\\u00e9ans who was by birth a Princess Palatine. And indeed Princesse Mathilde, animated by sentiments so entirely French, e pressed them with a straightforward bluntness that recalled the Germany of an older generation, and was inherited, doubtless, from her Wuerttemberg mother. This somewhat rude and almost masculine frankness she softened, as soon as she began to smile, with an Italian languor. And the whole person was clothed in a dress so typically \\u2018Second Empire\\u2019 that \\u2014 for all that the Princess wore it simply and solely, no doubt, from attachment to the fashions that she had loved when she was young \\u2014 she seemed to have deliberately planned to avoid the slightest discrepancy in historic colour, and to be satisfying the e pectations of those who looked to her to evoke the memory of another age. I whispered to Swann to ask her whether she had known Musset. \\u201cVery slightly, sir,\\u201d was the answer, given in a tone which seemed to feign annoyance at the question, and of course it was by way of a joke that she called Swann \\u2018Sir,\\u2019 since they were intimate friends. \\u201cI had him to dine once. I had invited him for seven o\\u2019clock. At half-past seven, as he had not appeared, we sat down to dinner. He arrived at eight, bowed to me, took his seat, never opened his lips, went off after dinner without letting me hear the sound of his voice. Of course, he was dead drunk. That hardly encouraged me to make another attempt.\\u201d We were standing a little way off, Swann and I. \\u201cI hope this little audience is not going to last much longer,\\u201d he muttered, \\u201cthe soles of my feet are hurting. I cannot think why my wife keeps on making conversation. When we get home it will be she that complains of being tired, and she knows I simply cannot go on standing like this.\\u201d For Mme. Swann, who had had the news from Mme. Bontemps, was in the course of telling the Princess that the Government, having at last begun to realise the depth of its depravity, had decided to send her an invitation to be present on the platform in a few days\\u2019 time, when the Tsar Nicholas was to visit the Invalides. But the Princess who, in spite of appearances, in spite of the character of her circle, which consisted mainly of artists and literary people, had remained at heart and shewed herself, whenever she had to take action, the niece of Napoleon, replied: \\u201cYes, Madame, I received it this morning, and I sent it back to the Minister, who must have had it by now. I told him that I had no need of an invitation to go to the Invalides. If the Government desires my presence there, it will not be on the platform, it will be in our vault, where the Emperor\\u2019s tomb is. I have no need of a card to admit me there. I have my keys. I go in and out when I choose. The Government has only to let me know whether it wishes me to be present or not. But if I do go to the Invalides, it will be down below there or nowhere at all.\\u201d At that moment we were saluted, Mme. Swann and I, by a young man who greeted her without stopping, and whom I was not aware that she knew; it was Bloch. I inquired about him, and was told that he had been  duced to her by Mme. Bontemps, and that he was employed in the Minister\\u2019s secretariat, which was news to me. Anyhow, she could not have seen him often \\u2014 or perhaps she had not cared to utter the name, hardly \\u2018smart\\u2019 enough for her liking, of Bloch, for she told me that he was called M. Moreul. I assured her that she was mistaken, that his name was Bloch. The Princess gathered up the train that flowed out behind her, while Mme. Swann gazed at it with admiring eyes. \\u201cIt is only a fur that the Emperor of Russia sent me,\\u201d she e plained, \\u201cand as I have just been to see him I put it on, so as to shew him that I\\u2019d managed to have it made up as a mantle.\\u201d \\u201cI hear that Prince Louis has joined the Russian Army; the Princess will be very sad at losing him,\\u201d went on Mme. Swann, not noticing her husband\\u2019s signals of distress. \\u201cThat was a fine thing to do. As I said to him, \\u2018Just because there\\u2019s been a soldier, before, in the family, that\\u2019s no reason!\\u2019\\u201d replied the Princess, alluding with this abrupt simplicity to Napoleon the Great. But Swann could hold out no longer. \\u201cMa\\u2019am, it is I that am going to play the Prince, and ask your permission to retire; but, you see, my wife has not been so well, and I do not like her to stand still for any time.\\u201d Mme. Swann curtseyed again, and the Princess conferred upon us all a celestial smile, which she seemed to have summoned out of the past, from among the graces of her girlhood, from the evenings at Compi\\u00e8gne, a smile which glided, sweet and unbroken, over her hitherto so sullen face; then she went on her way, followed by the two ladies in waiting, who had confined themselves, in the manner of interpreters, of children\\u2019s or invalids\\u2019 nurses, to punctuating our conversation with insignificant sentences and superfluous e planations. \\u201cYou should go and write your name in her book, one day this week,\\u201d Mme. Swann counselled me. \\u201cOne doesn\\u2019t leave cards upon these \\u2018Royalties,\\u2019 as the English call them, but she will invite you to her house if you put your name down.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Sometimes in those last days of winter we would go, before proceeding on our e pedition, into one of the small picture-shows that were being given at that time, where Swann, as a collector of mark, was greeted with special deference by the dealers in whose galleries they were held. And in that still wintry weather the old longing to set out for the South of France and Venice would be reawakened in me by those rooms in which a springtime, already well advanced, and a blazing sun cast violet shadows upon the roseate Alpilles and gave the intense transparency of emeralds to the Grand Canal. If the weather were inclement, we would go to a concert or a theatre, and afterwards to one of the fashionable tearooms. There, whenever Mme. Swann had anything to say to me which she did not wish the people at the ne t table, or even the waiters who brought our tea, to understand, she would say it in English, as though that had been a secret language known to our two selves alone. As it happened everyone in the place knew English \\u2014 I only had not yet learned the language, and was obliged to say so to Mme. Swann in order that she might cease to make, on the people who were drinking tea or were serving us with it, remarks which I guessed to be uncomplimentary without either my understanding or the person referred to losing a single word  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Once, in the matter of an afternoon at the theatre, Gilberte gave me a great surprise. It was precisely the day of which she had spoken to me some time back, on which fell the anniversary of her grandfather\\u2019s death. We were to go, she and I, with her governess, to hear selections from an opera, and Gilberte had dressed with a view to attending this performance, and wore the air of indifference with which she was in the habit of treating whatever we might be going to do, with the comment that it might be anything in the world, no matter what, provided that it amused me and had her parents\\u2019 approval. Before luncheon, her mother drew us aside to tell us that her father was ve ed at the thought of our going to a theatre on that day. This seemed to me only natural. Gilberte remained impassive, but grew pale with an anger which she was unable to conceal; still she uttered not a word. When M. Swann joined us his wife took him to the other end of the room and said something in his ear. He called Gilberte, and they went together into the ne t room. We could hear their raised voices. And yet I could not bring myself to believe that Gilberte, so submissive, so loving, so thoughtful, would resist her father\\u2019s appeal, on such a day and for so trifling a matter. At length Swann reappeared with her, saying: \\u201cYou heard what I said. Now you may do as you like.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Gilberte\\u2019s features remained compressed in a frown throughout luncheon, after which we retired to her room. Then suddenly, without hesitating and as though she had never at any point hesitated over her course of action: \\u201cTwo o\\u2019clock!\\u201d she e claimed. \\u201cYou know the concert begins at half past.\\u201d And she told her governess to make haste  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cBut,\\u201d I reminded her, \\u201cwon\\u2019t your father be cross with you?\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cNot the least little bit!\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cSurely, he was afraid it would look odd, because of the anniversary.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cWhat difference can it make to me what people think? I think it\\u2019s perfectly absurd to worry about other people in matters of sentiment. We feel things for ourselves, not for the public. Mademoiselle has very few pleasures; she\\u2019s been looking forward to going to this concert. I am not going to deprive her of it just to satisfy public opinion.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cBut, Gilberte,\\u201d I protested, taking her by the arm, \\u201cit is not to satisfy public opinion, it is to please your father.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cYou are not going to pass remarks upon my conduct, I hope,\\u201d she said sharply, plucking her arm away  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 * * *  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 A favour still more precious than their taking me with them to the Jardin d\\u2019Acclimatation, the Swanns did not e clude me even from their friendship with Bergotte, which had been at the root of the attraction that I had found in them when, before I had even seen Gilberte, I reflected that her intimacy with that godlike elder would have made her, for me, the most passionately enthralling of friends, had not the disdain that I was bound to inspire in her forbidden me to hope that she would ever take me, in his company, to visit the towns that he loved. And lo, one day, came an invitation from Mme. Swann to a big luncheon-party. I did not know who else were to be the guests. On my arrival I was disconcerted, as I crossed the hall, by an alarming incident. Mme. Swann seldom missed an opportunity of adopting any of those customs which pass as fashionable for a season, and then, failing to find support, are speedily abandoned as, for instance, many years before, she had had her \\u2018private hansom,\\u2019 or now had, printed in English upon a card inviting you to luncheon, the words, \\u2018To meet,\\u2019 followed by the name of some more or less important personage. Often enough these usages implied nothing mysterious and required no initiation. Take, for instance, a minute innovation of those days, imported from England; Odette had made her husband have some visiting cards printed on which the name Charles Swann was preceded by \\u2018Mr.\\u2019. After the first visit that I paid her, Mme. Swann had left at my door one of these \\u2018pasteboards,\\u2019 as she called them. No one had ever left a card on me before; I felt at once so much pride, emotion, gratitude that, scraping together all the money I possessed, I ordered a superb basket of camellias and had it sent to Mme. Swann. I implored my father to go and leave a card on her, but first, quickly, to have some printed on which his name should bear the prefi  \\u2018Mr.\\u2019. He vouchsafed neither of my prayers; I was in despair for some days, and then asked myself whether he might not after all have been right. But this use of \\u2018Mr.,\\u2019 if it meant nothing, was at least intelligible. Not so with another that was revealed to me on the occasion of this luncheon-party, but revealed without any indication of its purport. At the moment when I was about to step from the hall into the drawing-room the butler handed me a thin, oblong envelope upon which my name was inscribed. In my surprise I thanked him; but I eyed the envelope with misgivings. I no more knew what I was e pected to do with it than a foreigner knows what to do with one of those little utensils that they lay by his place at a Chinese banquet. I noticed that it was gummed down; I was afraid of appearing indiscreet, were I to open it then and there; and so I thrust it into my pocket with an air of knowing all about it. Mme. Swann had written to me a few days before, asking me to come to luncheon with \\u2018just a few people.\\u2019 There were, however, si teen of us, among whom I never suspected for a moment that I was to find Bergotte. Mme. Swann, who had already \\u2018named\\u2019 me, as she called it, to several of her guests, suddenly, after my name, in the same tone that she had used in uttering it in fact, as though we were merely two of the guests at her party, who ought each to feel equally flattered on meeting the other, pronounced that of the sweet Singer with the snowy locks. The name Bergotte made me jump like the sound of a revolver fired at me point blank, but instinctively, for appearance\\u2019s sake, I bowed; there, straight in front of me, as by one of those conjurers whom we see standing whole and unharmed, in their frock coats, in the smoke of a pistol shot out of which a pigeon has just fluttered, my salute was returned by a young common little thick-set peering person, with a red nose curled like a snail-shell and a black tuft on his chin. I was cruelly disappointed, for what had just vanished in the dust of the e plosion was not only the feeble old man, of whom no vestige now remained; there was also the beauty of an immense work which I had contrived to enshrine in the frail and hallowed organism that I had constructed, like a temple, e pressly for itself, but for which no room was to be found in the squat figure, packed tight with blood-vessels, bones, muscles, sinews, of the little man with the snub nose and black beard who stood before me. All the Bergotte whom I had slowly and delicately elaborated for myself, drop by drop, like a stalactite, out of the transparent beauty of his books, ceased I could see at once to be of any use, the moment I was obliged to include in him the snail-shell nose and to utilise the little black beard; just as we must reject as worthless the solution of a problem the terms of which we have not read in full, having failed to observe that the total must amount to a specified figure. The nose and beard were elements similarly ineluctable, and all the more aggravating in that, while forcing me to reconstruct entirely the personage of Bergotte, they seemed further to imply, to produce, to secrete incessantly a certain quality of mind, alert and self-satisfied, which was not in the picture, for such a mind had no conne ion whatever with the sort of intelligence that was diffused throughout those books, so intimately familiar to me, which were permeated by a gentle and godlike wisdom. Starting from them, I should never have arrived at that snail-shell nose; but starting from the nose, which did not appear to be in the slightest degree ashamed of itself, but stood out alone there like a grotesque ornament fastened on his face, I must proceed in a diametrically opposite direction from the work of Bergotte, I must arrive, it would seem, at the mentality of a busy and preoccupied engineer, of the sort who when you accost him in the street thinks it correct to say: \\u201cThanks, and you?\\u201d before you have actually inquired of them how they are, or else, if you assure them that you have been charmed to make their acquaintance, respond with an abbreviation which they imagine to be effective, intelligent and up-to-date, inasmuch as it avoids any waste of precious time on vain formalities: \\u201cSame here!\\u201d Names are, no doubt, but whimsical draughtsmen, giving us of people as well as of places sketches so little like the reality that we often e perience a kind of stupor when we have before our eyes, in place of the imagined, the visible world which, for that matter, is not the true world, our senses being little more endowed than our imagination with the art of portraiture, so little, indeed, that the final and appro imately lifelike pictures which we manage to obtain of reality are at least as different from the visible world as that was from the imagined. But in Bergotte\\u2019s case, my preconceived idea of him from his name troubled me far less than my familiarity with his work, to which I was obliged to attach, as to the cord of a balloon, the man with the little beard, without knowing whether it would still have the strength to raise him from the ground. It seemed quite clear, however, that it really was he who had written the books that I had so greatly enjoyed, for Mme. Swann having thought it incumbent upon her to tell him of my admiration for one of these, he shewed no surprise that she should have mentioned this to him rather than to any other of the party, nor did he seem to regard her action as due to a misapprehension, but, swelling out the frock coat which he had put on in honour of all these distinguished guests with a body distended in anticipation of the coming meal, while his mind was completely occupied by other, more real and more important considerations, it was only as at some finished episode in his early life, as though one had made an illusion to a costume of the Duc de Guise which he had worn, one season, at a fancy dress ball, that he smiled as he bore his mind back to the idea of his books; which at once began to fall in my estimation dragging down with them the whole value of Beauty, of the world, of life itself, until they seemed to have been merely the casual amusement of a man with a little beard. I told myself that he must have taken great pains over them, but that, if he had lived upon an island surrounded by beds of pearl-oysters, he would instead have devoted himself to, and would have made a fortune out of, the pearling trade. His work no longer appeared to me so inevitable. And then I asked myself whether originality did indeed prove that great writers were gods, ruling each one over a kingdom that was his alone, or whether all that was not rather make-believe, whether the differences between one man\\u2019s book and another\\u2019s were not the result of their respective labours rather than the e pression of a radical and essential difference between two contrasted personalities  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Meanwhile we had taken our places at the table. By the side of my plate I found a carnation, the stalk of which was wrapped in silver paper. It embarrassed me less than the envelope that had been handed to me in the hall, which, however, I had completely forgotten. This custom, strange as it was to me, became more intelligible when I saw all the male guests take up the similar carnations that were lying by their plates and slip them into the buttonholes of their coats. I did as they had done, with the air of spontaneity that a free-thinker assumes in church, who is not familiar with the order of service but rises when everyone else rises and kneels a moment after everyone else is on his knees. Another usage, equally strange to me but less ephemeral, disquieted me more. On the other side of my plate was a smaller plate, on which was heaped a blackish substance which I did not then know to be caviare. I was ignorant of what was to be done with it but firmly determined not to let it enter my mouth  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Bergotte was sitting not far from me and I could hear quite well everything that he said. I understood then the impression that M. de Norpois had formed of him. He had indeed a peculiar \\u2018organ\\u2019; there is nothing that so much alters the material qualities of the voice as the presence of thought behind what one is saying; the resonance of one\\u2019s diphthongs, the energy of one\\u2019s labials are profoundly affected \\u2014 in fact, one\\u2019s whole way of speaking. His seemed to me to differ entirely from his way of writing, and even the things that he said from those with which he filled his books. But the voice issues from behind a mask through which it is not powerful enough to make us recognise, at first sight, a face which we have seen uncovered in the speaker\\u2019s literary style. At certain pobts in the conversation, when Bergotte, by force of habit, began to talk in a way which no one but M. de Norpois would have thought affected or unpleasant, it was a long time before I discovered an e act correspondence with the parts of his books in which his form became so poetic and so musical. At those points I could see in what he was saying a plastic beauty independent of whatever his sentences might mean, and as human speech reflects the human soul, though without e pressing it as does literary style, Bergotte appeared almost to be talking nonsense, intoning certain words and, if he were secretly pursuing, beneath them, a single image, stringing them together uninterruptedly on one continuous note, with a wearisome monotony. So that a pretentious, emphatic and monotonous opening was a sign of the rare aesthetic value of what he was saying, and an effect, in his conversation, of the same power which, in his books, produced that harmonious flow of imagery. I had had all the more difficulty in discovering this at first since what he said at such moments, precisely because it was the authentic utterance of Bergotte, had not the appearance of being Bergotte\\u2019s. It was an abundant crop of clearly defined ideas, not included in that \\u2018Bergotte manner\\u2019 which so many story-tellers had appropriated to themselves; and this dissimilarity was probably but another aspect \\u2014 made out with difficulty through the stream of conversation, as an eclipse is seen through a smoked glass \\u2014 of the fact that when one read a page of Bergotte it was never just what would have been written by any of those lifeless imitators who, nevertheless, in newspapers and in books, adorned their prose with so many \\u2018Bergottish\\u2019 images and ideas. This difference in style arose from the fact that what was meant by \\u2018Bergottism\\u2019 was, first and foremost, a priceless element of truth hidden in the heart of everything, whence it was e tracted by that great writer, by virtue of his genius, and that this e traction, and not simply the perpetration of \\u2018Bergottisms,\\u2019 was my sweet Singer\\u2019s aim in writing. Though, it must be added, he continued to perpetrate them in spite of himself, and because he was Bergotte, so that, in one sense, every fresh beauty in his work was the little drop of Bergotte buried at the heart of a thing which he had distilled from it. But if, for that reason, each of those beauties was related to all the rest, and had a \\u2018family likeness,\\u2019 yet each remained separate and individual, as was the act of discovery that had brought it to the light of day; new, and consequently different from what was called the Bergotte manner, which was a loose synthesis of all the \\u2018Bergottisms\\u2019 already invented and set forth by him in writing, with no indication by which men who lacked genius might forecast what would be his ne t discovery. So it is with all great writers, the beauty of their language is as incalculable as that of a woman whom we have never seen; it is creative, because it is applied to an e ternal object of which, and not of their language or its beauty, they are thinking, to which they have not yet given e pression. An author of memorials of our time, wishing to write without too obviously seeming to be writing like Saint-Simon, might, on occasion, give us the first line of his portrait of Villars: \\u201cHe was a rather tall man, dark . . . with an alert, open, e pressive physiognomy,\\u201d but what law of determinism could bring him to the discovery of Saint-Simon\\u2019s ne t line, which begins with \\u201cand, to tell the truth, a trifle mad\\u201d? The true variety is in this abundance of real and une pected elements, in the branch loaded with blue flowers which thrusts itself forward, against all reason, from the spring hedgerow that seemed already overcharged with blossoms, whereas the purely formal imitation of variety and one might advance the same argument for all the other qualities of style is but a barren uniformity, that is to say the very antithesis of variety, and cannot, in the work of imitators, give the illusion or recall other e amples of variety save to a reader who has not acquired the sense of it from the masters themselves  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 And so \\u2014 just as Bergotte\\u2019s way of speaking would no doubt have been charming if he himself had been merely an amateur repeating imitations of Bergotte, whereas it was attached to the mind of Bergotte, at work and in action, by essential ties which the ear did not at once distinguish \\u2014 so it was because Bergotte applied that mind with precision to the reality which pleased him that his language had in it something positive, something over-rich, disappointing those who e pected to hear him speak only of the \\u2018eternal torrent of forms,\\u2019 and of the \\u2018mystic thrills of beauty.\\u2019 Moreover the quality, always rare and new, of what he wrote was e pressed in his conversation by so subtle a manner of approaching a question, ignoring every aspect of it that was already familiar, that he appeared to be seizing hold of an unimportant detail, to be quite wrong about it, to be speaking in parado , so that his ideas seemed as often as not to be in confusion, for each of us finds lucidity only in those ideas which are in the same state of confusion as his own. Besides, as all novelty depends upon the elimination, first, of the stereotyped attitude to which we have grown accustomed, and which has seemed to us to be reality itself, every new conversation, as well as all original painting and music, must always appear laboured and tedious. It is founded upon figures of speech with which we are not familiar, the speaker appears to us to be talking entirely in metaphors; and this wearies us, and gives us the impression of a want of truth. After all, the old forms of speech must in their time have been images difficult to follow when the listener was not yet cognisant of the uni which they depicted. But he has long since decided that this must be the real universe, and so relies confidently upon it. So when Bergotte \\u2014 and his figures appear simple enough to-day \\u2014 said of Cottard that he was a mannikin in a bottle, always trying to rise to the surface, and of Brichot that \\u201cto him even more than to Mme. Swann the arrangement of his hair was a matter for an ious deliberation, because, in his twofold preoccupation over his profile and his reputation, he had always to make sure that it was so brushed as to give him the air at once of a lion and of a philosopher,\\u201d one immediately felt the strain, and sought a foothold upon something which one called more concrete, meaning by that more ordinary. These unintelligible words, issuing from the mask that I had before my eyes, it was indeed to the writer whom I admired that they must be attributed, and yet they could not have been inserted among his books, in the form of a puzzle set in a series of different puzzles, they occupied another plane and required a transposition by means of which, one day, when I was repeating to myself certain phrases that I had heard Bergotte use, I discovered in them the whole machinery of his literary style, the different elements of which I was able to recognise and to name in this spoken discourse which had struck me as being so different  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 >From a less immediate point of view the special way, a little too meticulous, too intense, that he had of pronouncing certain words, certain adjectives which were constantly recurring in his conversation, and which he never uttered without a certain emphasis, giving to each of their syllables a separate force and intoning the last syllable as for instance the word visage, which he always used in preference to figure, and enriched with a number of superfluous v\\u2019s and s\\u2019s and g\\u2019s, which seemed all to e plode from his outstretched palm at such moments corresponded e actly to the fine passages in which, in his prose, he brought those favourite words into the light, preceded by a sort of margin and composed in such a way in the metrical whole of the phrase that the reader was obliged, if he were not to make a false quantity, to give to each of them its full value. And yet one did not find in the speech of Bergotte a certain luminosity which in his books, as in those of some other writers, often modified in the written phrase the appearance of its words. This was doubtless because that light issues from so profound a depth that its rays do not penetrate to our spoken words in the hours in which, thrown open to others by the act of conversation, we are to a certain e tent closed against ourselves. In this respect, there were more intonations, there was more accent in his books than in his talk; an accent independent of the beauty of style, which the author himself has possibly not perceived, for it is not separable from his most intimate personality. It was this accent which, at the moments when, in his books, Bergotte was entirely natural, gave a rhythm to the words \\u2014 often at such times quite insignificant \\u2014 that he wrote. This accent is not marked on the printed page, there is nothing there to indicate it, and yet it comes of its own accord to his phrases, one cannot pronounce them in any other way, it is what was most ephemeral and at the same time most profound in the writer, and it is what will bear witness to his true nature, what will say whether, despite all the austerity that he has e pressed he was gentle, despite all his sensuality sentimental  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Certain peculiarities of elocution, faint traces of which were to be found in Bergotte\\u2019s conversation, were not e clusively his own; for when, later on, I came to know his brothers and sisters, I found those peculiarities much more accentuated in their speech. There was something abrupt and harsh in the closing words of a light and spirited utterance, something faint and dying at the end of a sad one. Swann, who had known the Master as a boy, told me that in those days one used to hear on his lips, just as much as on his brothers\\u2019 and sisters\\u2019, those infle ions, almost a family type, shouts of violent merriment interspersed with murmurings of a long-drawn melancholy, and that in the room in which they all played together he used to perform his part, better than any of them, in their symphonies, alternately deafening and subdued. However characteristic it may be, the sound that escapes from human lips is fugitive and does not survive the speaker. But it was not so with the pronunciation of the Bergotte family. For if it is difficult ever to understand, even in the Meistersinger, how an artist can invent music by listening to the twittering of birds, yet Bergotte had transposed and fi ed in his written language that manner of dwelling on words which repeat themselves in shouts of joy, or fall, drop by drop, in melancholy sighs. There are in his books just such closing phrases where the accumulated sounds are prolonged as in the last chords of the overture of an opera which cannot come to an end, and repeats several times over its supreme cadence before the conductor finally lays down his baton, in which, later on, I was to find a musical equivalent for those phonetic \\u2018brasses\\u2019 of the Bergotte family. But in his own case, from the moment in which he transferred them to his books, he ceased instinctively to make use of them in his speech. From the day on which he had begun to write \\u2014 all the more markedly, therefore, in the later years in which I first knew him \\u2014 his voice had lost this orchestration for ever  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 These young Bergottes \\u2014 the future writer and his brothers and sisters \\u2014 were doubtless in no way superior, far from it, to other young people, more refined, more intellectual than themselves, who found the Bergottes rather \\u2018loud that is to say a trifle vulgar, irritating one by the witticisms which characterised the tone, at once pretentious and puerile, of their household. But genius, and even what is only great talent, springs less from seeds of intellect and social refinement superior to those of other people than from the faculty of transposing, and so transforming them. To heat a liquid over an electric lamp one requires to have not the strongest lamp possible, but one of which the current can cease to illuminate, can be diverted so as instead of light to give heat. To mount the skies it is not necessary to have the most powerful of motors, one must have a motor which, instead of continuing to run along the earth\\u2019s surface, intersecting with a vertical line the horizontal which it began by following, is capable of converting its speed into ascending force. Similarly the men who produce works of genius are not those who live in the most delicate atmosphere, whose conversation is most brilliant or their culture broadest, but those who have had the power, ceasing in a moment to live only for themselves, to make use of their personality as of a mirror, m such a way that their life, however unimportant it may be socially, and even, in a sense, intellectually speaking, is reflected by it, genius consisting in the reflective power of the writer and not in the intrinsic quality of the scene reflected. The day on which young Bergotte succeeded in shewing to the world of his readers the tasteless household in which he had passed his childhood, and the not very amusing conversations between himself and his brothers, on that day he climbed far above the friends of his family, more intellectual and more distinguished than himself; they in their fine Rolls Royces might return home e pressing due contempt for the vulgarity of the Bergottes; but he, with his modest engine which had at last left the ground, he soared above their heads  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 But there were other characteristics of his elocution which it was not with the members of his family, but with certain contemporary writers, that he must share. Younger men, who were beginning to repudiate him as a master and disclaimed any intellectual affinity to him in themselves, displayed their affinity without knowing it when they made use of the same adverbs, the same prepositions that he incessantly repeated, when they constructed their sentences in the same way, spoke in the same quiescent, lingering tone, by a reaction from the eloquent, easy language of an earlier generation. Perhaps these young men \\u2014 we shall come across some of whom this may be said \\u2014 had never known Bergotte. But his way of thinking, inoculated into them, had led them to those alterations of synta  and of accent which bear a necessary relation to originality of mind. A relation which, incidentally, requires to be traced. Thus Bergotte, if he owed nothing to any man for his manner of writing, derived his manner of speaking from one of his early associates, a marvellous talker to whose ascendancy he had succumbed, whom he imitated, unconsciously, in his conversation, but who himself, being less gifted, had never written any really outstanding book. So that if one had been in quest of originality in speech, Bergotte must have been labelled a disciple, a writer at second-hand, whereas, influenced by his friend only so far as talk went, he had been original and creative in his writings. Doubtless again, so as to distinguish himself from the previous generation, too fond as it had been of abstractions, of weighty commonplaces, when Bergotte wished to speak favourably of a book, what he would bring into prominence, what he would quote with approval would always be some scene that furnished the reader with an image, some picture that had no rational significance. \\u201cAh, yes!\\u201d he would e claim, \\u201cit is quite admirable! There is a little girl in an orange shawl. It is e cellent!\\u201d or again, \\u201cOh, yes, there is a passage in which there is a regiment marching along the street; yes, it is e cellent!\\u201d As for style, he was not altogether of his time though he remained quite e clusively of his race, abominating Tolstoy, George Eliot, Ibsen and Dostoievsky, for the word that always came to his lips when he wished to praise the style of any writer was \\u2018mild.\\u2019 \\u201cYes, you know I like Chateaubriand better in Atalathan in Ren\\u00e9; he seems to me to be \\u2018milder.\\u2019\\u201d He said the word like a doctor who, when his patient assures him that milk will give him indigestion, answers, \\u201cBut, you know, it\\u2019s very \\u2018mild\\u2019.\\u201d And it is true that there was in Bergotte\\u2019s style a kind of harmony similar to that for which the ancients used to praise certain of their orators in terms which we now find it hard to understand, accustomed as we are to our own modern tongues in which effects of that kind are not sought  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 He would say also, with a shy smile, of pages of his own for which some one had e pressed admiration: \\u201cI think it is more or less true, more or less accurate; it may be of some value perhaps,\\u201d but he would say this simply from modesty, as a woman to whom one has said that her dress, or her daughter, is charming replies, \\u201cIt is comfortable,\\u201d or \\u201cShe is a good girl.\\u201d But the constructive instinct was too deeply implanted in Bergotte for him not to be aware that the sole proof that he had built usefully and on the lines of truth lay in the pleasure that his work had given, to himself first of all and afterwards to his readers. Only many years later, when he no longer had any talent, whenever he wrote anything with which he was not satisfied, so as not to have to suppress it, as he ought to have done, so as to be able to publish it with a clear conscience he would repeat, but to himself this time: \\u201cAfter all, it is more or less accurate, it must be of some value to the country.\\u201d So that the phrase murmured long ago among his admirers by the insincere voice of modesty came in the end to be whispered in the secrecy of his heart by the uneasy tongue of pride. And the same words which had served Bergotte as an unwanted e cuse for the e cellence of his earliest works became as it were an ineffective consolation to him for the hopeless mediocrity of the latest  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 A kind of austerity of taste which he had, a kind of determination to write nothing of which he could not say that it was \\u2018mild,\\u2019 which had made people for so many years regard him as a sterile and precious artist, a chiseller of e quisite trifles, was on the contrary the secret of his strength, for habit forms the style of the writer just as much as the character of the man, and the author who has more than once been patient to attain, in the e pression of his thoughts, to a certain kind of attractiveness, in so doing lays down unalterably the boundaries of his talent, just as if he yields too often to pleasure, to laziness, to the fear of being put to trouble, he will find himself describing in terms which no amount of revision can modify, the forms of his own vices and the limits of his virtue  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 If, however, despite all the analogies which I was to perceive later on between the writer and the man, I had not at first sight, in Mme. Swann\\u2019s drawing-room, believed that this could be Bergotte, the author of so many divine books, who stood before me, perhaps I was not altogether wrong, for he himself did not, in the strict sense of the word, \\u2018believe\\u2019 it either. He did not believe it because he shewed a great assiduity in the presence of fashionable people and yet he was not a snob, of literary men and journalists who were vastly inferior to himself. Of course he had long since learned, from the suffrage of his readers, that he had genius, compared to which social position and official rank were as nothing. He had learned that he had genius, but he did not believe it because he continued to simulate deference towards mediocre writers in order to succeed, shortly, in becoming an Academician, whereas the Academy and the Faubourg Saint-Germain have no more to do with that part of the Eternal Mind which is the author of the works of Bergotte than with the law of causality or the idea of God. That also he knew, but as a kleptomaniac knows, without profiting by the knowledge, that it is wrong to steal. And the man with the little beard and snail-shell nose knew and used all the tricks of the gentleman who pockets your spoons, in his efforts to reach the coveted academic chair, or some duchess or other who could dispose of several votes at the election, but while on his way to them he would endeavour to make sure that no one who would consider the pursuit of such an object a vice in him should see what he was doing. He was only half-successful; one could hear, alternating with the speech of the true Bergotte, that of the other Bergotte, ambitious, utterly selfish, who thought it not worth his while to speak of any but his powerful, rich or noble friends, so as to enhance his own position, he who in his books, when he was really himself, had so well portrayed the charm, pure as a mountain spring, of poverty  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 As for those other vices to which M. de Norpois had alluded, that almost incestuous love, which was made still worse, people said, by a want of delicacy in the matter of money, if they contradicted, in a shocking manner, the tendency of his latest novels, in which he shewed everywhere a regard for what was right and proper so painfully rigid that the most innocent pleasures of their heroes were poisoned by it, and that even the reader found himself turning their pages with a sense of acute discomfort, and asked himself whether it was possible to go on living even the quietest of lives, those vices did not at all prove, supposing that they were fairly imputed to Bergotte, that his literature was a lie and all his sensitiveness mere play-acting. Just as in pathology certain conditions similar in appearance are due, some to an e cess, others to an insufficiency of tension, of secretion and so forth, so there may be vice arising from supersensitiveness just as much as from the lack of it. Perhaps it is only in really vicious lives that the moral problem can arise in all its disquieting strength. And of this problem the artist finds a solution in the terms not of his own personal life but of what is for him the true life, a general, a literary solution. As the great Doctors of the Church began often, without losing their virtue, by acquainting themselves with the sins of all mankind, out of which they e tracted their own personal sanctity, so great artists often, while being thoroughly wicked, make use of their vices in order to arrive at a conception of the moral law that is binding upon us all. It is the vices or merely the weaknesses and follies of the circle in which they live, the meaningless conversation, the frivolous or shocking lives of their daughters, the infidelity of their wives, or their own misdeeds that writers have most often castigated in their books, without, however, thinking it necessary to alter their domestic economy or to improve the tone of their households. And this contrast had never before been so striking as it was in Bergotte\\u2019s time, because, on the one hand, in proportion as society grew more corrupt, our notions of morality were increasingly e alted, while on the other hand the public were now told far more than they had ever hitherto known about the private lives of literary men; and on certain evenings in the theatre people would point out the author whom I had so greatly admired at Combray, sitting at the back of a bo  the mere composition of which seemed an oddly humorous, or perhaps keenly ironical commentary upon \\u2014 a brazen-faced denial of \\u2014 the thesis which he had just been maintaining in his latest book. Not that anything which this or that casual informant could tell me was of much use in helping me to settle the question of the goodness or wickedness of Bergotte. An intimate friend would furnish proofs of his hardheartedness; then a stranger would cite some instance touching, since he had evidently wished it to remain hidden of his real depth of feeling. He had behaved cruelly to his wife. But in a village inn, where he had gone to spend the night, he had stayed on to watch over a poor woman who had tried to drown herself, and when he was obliged to continue his journey had left a large sum of money with the landlord, so that he should not turn the poor creature out, but see that she got proper attention. Perhaps the more the great writer was developed in Bergotte at the e pense of the little man with the beard, so much the more his own personal life was drowned in the flood of all the lives that he imagined, until he no longer felt himself obliged to perform certain practical duties, for which he had substituted the duty of imagining those other lives. But at the same time, because he imagined the feelings of others as completely as if they had been his own, whenever he was obliged, for any reason, to talk to some person who had been unfortunate that is to say in a casual encounter he would, in doing so, take up not his own personal standpoint but that of the sufferer himself, a standpoint in which he would have been horrified by the speech of those who continued to think of their own petty concerns in the presence of another\\u2019s grief. With the result that he gave rise everywhere to justifiable rancour and to undying gratitude  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Above all, he was a man who in his heart of hearts loved nothing really e cept certain images and like a miniature set in the floor of a casket the composing and painting of them in words. For a trifle that some one had sent him, if that trifle gave him the opportunity of  ducing one or two of these images, he would be prodigal in the e pression of his gratitude, while shewing none whatever for an e pensive present. And if he had had to plead before a tribunal, he would inevitably have chosen his words not for the effect that they might have on the judge but with an eye to certain images which the judge would certainly never have perceived  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 That first day on which I met him with Gilberte\\u2019s parents, I mentioned to Bergotte that I had recently been to hear Berma in Ph\\u00e8dre; and he told me that in the scene in which she stood with her arm raised to the level of her shoulder \\u2014 one of those very scenes that had been greeted with such applause \\u2014 she had managed to suggest with great nobility of art certain classical figures which, quite possibly, she had never even seen, a Hesperid carved in the same attitude upon a metope at Olympia, and also the beautiful primitive virgins on the Erechtheum  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cIt may be sheer divination, and yet I fancy that she visits the museums. It would be interesting to \\u2018establish\\u2019 that.\\u201d \\u2018Establish\\u2019 was one of those regular Bergotte e pressions, and one which various young men who had never met him had caught from him, speaking like him by some sort of telepathic suggestion.  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cDo you mean the Cariatides?\\u201d asked Swann  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cNo, no,\\u201d said Bergotte, \\u201ce cept in the scene where she confesses her passion to Oenone, where she moves her hand e actly like Hegeso on the stele in the Ceramic, it is a far more primitive art that she revives. I was referring to the Korai of the old Erechtheum, and I admit that there is perhaps nothing quite so remote from the art of Racine, but there are so many things already in Ph\\u00e8dre, . . . that one more . . . Oh, and then, yes, she is really charming, that little si th century Phaedra, the rigidity of the arm, the lock of hair \\u2018frozen into marble,\\u2019 yes, you know, it is wonderful of her to have discovered all that. There is a great deal more antiquity in it than in most of the books they are labelling \\u2018antique\\u2019 this year.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 As Bergotte had in one of his volumes addressed a famous invocation to these archaic statues, the words that he was now uttering were quite intelligible to me and gave me a fresh reason for taking an interest in Berma\\u2019s acting. I tried to picture her again in my mind, as she had looked in that scene in which I remembered that she had raised her arm to the level of her shoulder. And I said to myself, \\u201cThere we have the Hesperid of Olympia; there we have the sister of those adorable suppliants on the Acropolis; there is indeed nobility in art!\\u201d But if these considerations were to enhance for me the beauty of Berma\\u2019s gesture, Bergotte should have put them into my head before the performance. Then, while that attitude of the actress was actually e isting in flesh and blood before my eyes, at that moment in which the thing that was happening had still the substance of reality, I might have tried to e tract from it the idea of archaic sculpture. But of Berma in that scene all that I retained was a memory which was no longer liable to modification, slender as a picture which lacks that abundant perspective of the present tense where one is free to delve and can always discover something new, a picture to which one cannot retrospectively give a meaning that is not subject to verification and correction from without. At this point Mme. Swann joined in the conversation, asking me whether Gilberte had remembered to give me what Bergotte had written aboutPh\\u00e8dre, and adding, \\u201cMy daughter is such a scatter-brain!\\u201d Bergotte smiled modestly and protested that they were only a few pages, of no importance. \\u201cBut it is perfectly charming, that little pamphlet, that little \\u2018tract\\u2019 of yours!\\u201d Mme. Swann assured him, to shew that she was a good hostess, to make the rest of us think that she had read Bergotte\\u2019s essay, and also because she liked not merely to flatter Bergotte, but to make a selection for herself out of what he wrote, to control his writing. And it must be admitted that she did inspire him, though not in the way that she supposed. But when all is said there is, between what constituted the smartness of Mme. Swann\\u2019s drawing-room and a whole side of Bergotte\\u2019s work, so close a correspondence that either of them might serve among elderly men to-day, as a commentary upon the other  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 I let myself go in telling him what my impressions had been. Often Bergotte disagreed, but he allowed me to go on talking. I told him that I had liked the green light which was turned on when Phaedra raised her arm. \\u201cAh! The designer will be glad to hear that; he is a real artist. I shall tell him you liked it, because he is very proud of that effect. I must say, myself, that I do not care for it very much, it drowns everything in a sort of aqueous vapour, little Phaedra standing there looks too like a branch of coral on the floor of an aquarium. You will tell me, of course, that it brings out the cosmic aspect of the play. That is quite true. All the same, it would be more appropriate if the scene were laid in the Court of Neptune. Oh yes, of course, I know the Vengeance of Neptune does come into the play. I don\\u2019t suggest for a moment that we should think only of Port-Royal, but after all the story that Racine tells us is not the \\u2018Loves of the Sea-Urchins.\\u2019 Still, it is what my friend wished to have, and it is very well done, right or wrong, and it\\u2019s really quite pretty when you come to look at it. Yes, so you liked that, did you; you understood what it meant, of course; we feel the same about it, don\\u2019t we, really; it is a trifle unbalanced, what he\\u2019s done, you agree with me, but on the whole it is very clever of him.\\u201d And so, when Bergotte had to e press an opinion which was the opposite of my own, he in no way reduced me to silence, to the impossibility of framing any reply, as M. de Norpois would have done. This does not prove that Bergotte\\u2019s opinions were of less value than the Ambassador\\u2019s; far from it. A powerful idea communicates some of its strength to him who challenges it. Being itself a part of the riches of the universal Mind, it makes its way into, grafts itself upon the mind of him whom it is employed to refute, slips in among the ideas already there, with the help of which, gaining a little ground, he completes and corrects it; so that the final utterance is always to some e tent the work of both parties to a discussion. It is to ideas which are not, properly speaking, ideas at all, to ideas which, founded upon nothing, can find no support, no kindred spirit among the ideas of the adversary, that he, grappling with something which is not there, can find no word to say in answer. The arguments of M. de Norpois in the matter of art were unanswerable simply because they were without reality  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Since Bergotte did not sweep aside my objections, I confessed to him that they had won the scorn of M. de Norpois. \\u201cBut he\\u2019s an old parrot!\\u201d was the answer. \\u201cHe keeps on pecking you because he imagines all the time that you\\u2019re a piece of cake, or a slice of cuttle-fish.\\u201d \\u201cWhat\\u2019s that?\\u201d asked Swann. \\u201cAre you a friend of Norpois?\\u201d \\u201cHe\\u2019s as dull as a wet Sunday,\\u201d interrupted his wife, who had great faith in Bergotte\\u2019s judgment, and was no doubt afraid that M. de Norpois might have spoken ill of her to us. \\u201cI tried to make him talk after dinner; I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019s his age or his indigestion, but I found him too sticky for words. I really thought I should have to \\u2018dope\\u2019 him.\\u201d \\u201cYes, isn\\u2019t he?\\u201d Bergotte chimed in. \\u201cYou see, he has to keep his mouth shut half the time so as not to use up all the stock of inanities that hold his shirt-front down and his white waistcoat up.\\u201d \\u201cI think that Bergotte and my wife are both very hard on him,\\u201d came from Swann, who took the \\u2018line,\\u2019 in his own house, of a plain, sensible man. \\u201cI quite see that Norpois cannot interest you very much, but from another point of view,\\u201d for Swann made a hobby of collecting scraps of \\u2018real life\\u2019 \\u201che is quite remarkable, quite a remarkable instance of a lover. When he was Secretary at Rome,\\u201d he went on, after making sure that Gilberte could not hear him, \\u201che had, here in Paris, a mistress with whom he was madly in love, and he found time to make the double journey every week, so as to see her for a couple of hours. She was, as it happens, a most intelligent woman, and is quite attractive to this day; she is a dowager now. And he has had any number of others since then. I\\u2019m sure I should have gone stark mad if the woman I was in love with lived in Paris and I was kept shut up in Rome. Nervous men ought always to love, as the lower orders say, \\u2018beneath\\u2019 them, so that their women have a material inducement to do what they tell them.\\u201d As he spoke, Swann realised that I might be applying this ma im to himself and Odette, and as, even among superior beings, at the moment when you and they seem to be soaring together above the plane of life, their personal pride is still basely human, he was seized by a violent ill-will towards me. But this was made manifest only in the uneasiness of his glance. He said nothing more to me at the time. Not that this need surprise us. When Racine according to a story the truth of which has been e ploded, though the theme of it may be found recurring every day in Parisian life made an illusion to Scarron in front of Louis XIV, the most powerful monarch on earth said nothing to the poet that evening. It was on the following day, only, that he fell  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 But as a theory requires to be stated as a whole, Swann, after this momentary irritation, and after wiping his eyeglass, finished saying what was in his mind in these words, words which were to assume later on in my memory the importance of a prophetic warning, which I had not had the sense to take: \\u201cThe danger of that kind of love, however, is that the woman\\u2019s subjection calms the man\\u2019s jealousy for a time but also makes it more e acting. After a little he will force his mistress to live like one of those prisoners whose cells they keep lighted day and night, to prevent their escaping. And that generally ends in trouble.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 I reverted to M. de Norpois. \\u201cYou must never trust him; he has the most wicked tongue!\\u201d said Mme. Swann in an accent which seemed to me to indicate that M. de Norpois had been \\u2018saying things\\u2019 about her, especially as Swann looked across at his wife with an air of rebuke, as though to stop her before she went too far  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Meanwhile Gilberte, who had been told to go and get ready for our drive, stayed to listen to the conversation, and hovered between her mother and her father, leaning affectionately against his shoulder. Nothing, at first sight, could be in greater contrast to Mme. Swann, who was dark, than this child with her red hair and golden skin. But after looking at them both for a moment one saw in Gilberte many of the features \\u2014 for instance, the nose cut short with a sharp, unfaltering decision by the unseen sculptor whose chisel repeats its work upon successive generations \\u2014 the e pression, the movements of her mother; to take an illustration from another form of art, she made one think of a portrait that was not a good likeness of Mme. Swann, whom the painter, to carry out some whim of colouring, had posed in a partial disguise, dressed to go out to a party in Venetian \\u2018character.\\u2019 And as not merely was she wearing a fair wig, but every atom of a swarthier comple ion had been discharged from her flesh which, stripped of its veil of brownness, seemed more naked, covered simply in rays of light shed by an internal sun, this \\u2018make-up\\u2019 was not just superficial but was incarnate in her; Gilberte had the appearance of embodying some fabulous animal or of having assumed a mythological disguise. This reddish skin was so e actly that of her father that nature seemed to have had, when Gilberte was being created, to solve the problem of how to reconstruct Mme. Swann piecemeal, without any material at her disposal save the skin of M. Swann. And nature had utilised this to perfection, like a master carver who makes a point of leaving the grain, the knots of his wood in evidence. On Gilberte\\u2019s face, at the corner of a perfect reproduction of Odette\\u2019s nose, the skin was raised so as to preserve intact the two beauty spots of M. Swann. It was a new variety ot Mme. Swann that was thus obtained, growing there by her side like a white lilac-tree beside a purple. At the same time it did not do to imagine the boundary line between these two likenesses as definitely fi ed. Now and then, when Gilberte smiled, one could distinguish the oval of her father\\u2019s cheek upon her mother\\u2019s face, as though some one had mi ed them together to see what would result from the blend; this oval grew distinct, as an embryo grows into a living shape, it lengthened obliquely, e panded, and a moment later had disappeared. In Gilberte\\u2019s eyes there was the frank and honest gaze of her father; this was how she had looked at me when she gave me the agate marble and said, \\u201cKeep it, to remind yourself of our friendship.\\u201d But were one to put a question to Gilberte, to ask her what she had been doing, then one saw in those same eyes the embarrassment, the uncertainty, the prevarication, the misery that Odette used in the old days to shew, when Swann asked her where she had been and she gave him one of those lying answers which, in those days, drove the lover to despair and now made him abruptly change the conversation, as an incurious and prudent husband. Often in the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es I was disturbed by seeing this look on Gilberte\\u2019s face. But as a rule my fears were unfounded. For in her, a purely physical survival of her mother, this look if nothing else had ceased to have any meaning. It was when she had been to her classes, when she must go home for some lesson, that Gilberte\\u2019s pupils e ecuted that movement which, in time past, in the eyes of Odette, had been caused by the fear of disclosing that she had, during the day, opened the door to one of her lovers, or was \\u2014 at that moment in a hurry to be at some trysting-place. So one could see the two natures of M. and Mme. Swann ebb and flow, encroaching alternately one upon the other in the body of this M\\u00e9lusine  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 It is, of course, common knowledge that a child takes after both its-father and its mother. And yet the distribution of the merits and defects which it inherits is so oddly planned that, of two good qualities which seemed inseparable in one of the parents you will find but one in the child, and allied to that very fault in the other parent which seemed most irreconcilable with it. Indeed, the incarnation of a good moral quality in an incompatible physical blemish is often one of the laws of filial resemblance. Of two sisters, one will combine with the proud bearing of her father the mean little soul of her mother; the other, abundantly endowed with the paternal intelligence, will present it to the world in the aspect which her mother has made familiar; her mother\\u2019s shapeless nose and scraggy bosom are become the bodily covering of talents which you had learned to distinguish beneath a superb presence. With the result that of each of the sisters one can say with equal justification that it is she who takes more after one or other of her parents. It is true that Gilberte was an only child, but there were, at the least, two Gilbertes. The two natures, her father\\u2019s and her mother\\u2019s, did more than just blend themselves in her; they disputed the possession of her \\u2014 and yet one cannot e actly say that, which would let it be thought that a third Gilberte was in the meantime suffering by being the prey of the two others. Whereas Gilberte was alternately one and the other, and at any given moment no more than one of the two, that is to say incapable, when she was not being good, of suffering accordingly, the better Gilberte not being able at the time, on account of her momentary absence, to detect the other\\u2019s lapse from virtue. And so the less good of the two was free to enjoy pleasures of an ignoble kind. When the other spoke to you from the heart of her father, she held broad views, you would have liked to engage with her upon a fine and beneficent enterprise; you told her so, but, just as your arrangements were being completed, her mother\\u2019s heart would already have resumed its control; hers was the voice that answered; and you were disappointed and ve ed \\u2014 almost baffled, as in the face of a substitution of one person for another \\u2014 by an unworthy thought, an insincere laugh, in which Gilberte saw no harm, for they sprang from what she herself at that moment was. Indeed, the disparity was at times so great between these two Gilbertes that you asked yourself, though without finding an answer, what on earth you could have said or done to her, last time, to find her now so different. When she herself had arranged to meet you somewhere, not only did she fail to appear, and offer no e cuse afterwards, but, whatever the influence might have been that had made her change her mind, she shewed herself in so different a character when you did meet her that you might well have supposed that, taken in by a likeness such as forms the plot of theMenaechmi, you were now talking to some one not the person who had so politely e pressed her desire to see you, had she not shewn signs of an ill-humour which revealed that she felt herself to be in the wrong, and wished to avoid the necessity of an e planation  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cNow then, run along and get ready; you\\u2019re keeping us waiting,\\u201d her mother reminded her  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cI\\u2019m so happy here with my little Papa; I want to stay just for a minute,\\u201d replied Gilberte, burying her head beneath the arm of her father, who passed his fingers lovingly through her bright hair  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Swann was one of those men who, having lived for a long time amid the illusions of love, have seen the prosperity that they themselves brought to numberless women increase the happiness of those women without e citing in them any gratitude, any tenderness towards their benefactors; but in their child they believe that they can feel an affection which, being incarnate in their own name, will enable them to remain in the world after their death. When there should no longer be any Charles Swann, there would still be a Mlle. Swann, or a Mme. something-else, n\\u00e9eSwann, who would continue to love the vanished father. Indeed, to love him too well, perhaps, Swann may have been thinking, for he acknowledged Gilberte\\u2019s caress with a \\u201cGood girl!\\u201d in that tone, made tender by our apprehension, to which, when we think of the future, we are prompted by the too passionate affection of a creature who is destined to survive us. To conceal his emotion, he joined in our talk about Berma. He pointed out to me, but in a detached, a listless tone, as though he wished to remain to some e tent unconcerned in what he was saying, with what intelligence, with what an astonishing fitness the actress said to Oenone, \\u201cYou knew it!\\u201d He was right. That intonation at least had a value that was really intelligible, and might therefore have satisfied my desire to find incontestable reasons for admiring Berma. But it was by the very fact of its clarity that it did not at all content me. Her intonation was so ingenious, so definite in intention and in its meaning, that it seemed to e ist by itself, so that any intelligent actress might have learned to use it. It was a fine idea; but whoever else should conceive it as fully must possess it equally. It remained to Berma\\u2019s credit that she had discovered it, but is one entitled to use the word \\u2018discover\\u2019 when the object in question is something that would not be different if one had been given it, something that does not belong essentially to one\\u2019s own nature seeing that some one else may afterwards reproduce it?  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cUpon my soul, your presence among us does raise the tone of the conversation!\\u201d Swann observed to me, as though to e cuse himself to Bergotte; for he had formed the habit, in the Guermantes set, of entertaining great artists as if they were just ordinary friends whom one seeks only to make eat the dishes that they like, play the games, or, in the country, indulge in whatever form of sport they please. \\u201cIt seems to me that we\\u2019re talking a great deal of art,\\u201d he went on. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s so nice, I do love it!\\u201d said Mme. Swann, throwing me a look of gratitude, as well from good nature as because she had not abandoned her old aspirations towards a more intellectual form of conversation. After this it was to others of the party, and principally to Gilberte, that Bergotte addressed himself. I had told him everything that I felt with a freedom which had astonished me, and was due to the fact that, having acquired with him, years before in the course of all those hours of solitary reading, in which he was to me merely the better part of myself, the habit of sincerity, of frankness, of confidence, I was less frightened by him than by a person with whom I should have been talking for the first time. And yet, for the same reason, I was greatly disturbed by the thought of the impression that I must have been making on him, the contempt that I had supposed he would feel for my ideas dating not from that afternoon but from the already distant time in which I had begun to read his books in our garden at Combray. And yet I ought perhaps to have reminded myself that, since it was in all sincerity, abandoning myself to the train of my thoughts, that I had felt, on the one hand, so intensely in sympathy with the work of Bergotte and on the other hand, in the theatre, a disappointment the reason of which I did not know, those two instinctive movements which had both carried me away could not be so very different from one another, but must be obedient to the same laws; and that that mind of Bergotte which I had loved in his books could not be anything entirely foreign and hostile to my disappointment and to my inability to e press it. For my intelligence must be a uniform thing, perhaps indeed there e ists but a single intelligence, in which everyone in the world participates, towards which each of us from the position of his own separate body turns his eyes, as in a theatre where, if everyone has his own separate seat, there is on the other hand but a single stage. Of course, the ideas which I was tempted to seek to disentangle were probably not those whose depths Bergotte usually sounded in his books. But if it were one and the same intelligence which we had, he and I, at our disposal, he must, when he heard me e press those ideas, be reminded of them, cherish them, smile upon them, keeping probably, in spite of what I supposed, before his mind\\u2019s eye a whole world of intelligence other than that an e cerpt of which had passed into his books, an e cerpt upon which I had based my imagination of his whole mental universe. Just as priests, having the widest e perience of the human heart, are best able to pardon the sins which they do not themselves commit, so genius, having the widest e perience of the human intelligence, can best understand the ideas most directly in opposition to those which form the foundation of its own writings. I ought to have told myself all this though, for that matter, it was none too consoling a thought, for the benevolent condescension of great minds has as a corollary the incomprehension and hostility of small; and one derives far less happiness from the friendliness of a great writer, which one finds e pressed, failing a more intimate association, in his books, than suffering from the hostility of a woman whom one did not choose for her intelligence but cannot help loving. I ought to have told myself all this, but I did not; I was convinced that I had appeared a fool to Bergotte, when Gilberte whispered in my ear:  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cYou can\\u2019t think how delighted I am, because you have made a conquest of my great friend Bergotte. He\\u2019s been telling Mamma that he found you e tremely intelligent.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cWhere are we going?\\u201d I asked her. \\u201cOh, wherever you like; you know, it\\u2019s all the same to me.\\u201d But since the incident that had occurred on the anniversary of her grandfather\\u2019s death I had begun to ask myself whether Gilberte\\u2019s character was not other than I had supposed, whether that indifference to what was to be done, that wisdom, that calm, that gentle and constant submission did not indeed conceal passionate longings which her self-esteem would not allow to be visible and which she disclosed only by her sudden resistance whenever by any chance they were frustrated. As Bergotte lived in the same neighbourhood as my parents, we left the house together; in the carriage he spoke to me of my health. \\u201cOur friends were telling me that you had been ill. I am very sorry. And yet, after all, I am not too sorry, because I can see quite well that you are able to enjoy the pleasures of the mind, and they are probably what mean most to you, as to everyone who has known them.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Alas, what he was saying, how little, I felt, did it apply to myself, whom all reasoning, however e alted it might be, left cold, who was happy only in moments of pure idleness, when I was comfortable and well; I felt how purely material was everything that I desired in life, and how easily I could dispense with the intellect. As I made no distinction among my pleasures between those that came to me from different sources, of varying depth and permanence, I was thinking, when the moment came to answer him, that I should have liked an e istence in which I was on intimate terms with the Duchesse de Guermantes, and often came across, as in the old toll-house in the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es, a chilly smell that would remind me of Combray. But in this ideal e istence which I dared not confide to him the pleasures of the mind found no place  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cNo, sir, the pleasures of the mind count for very little with me; it is not them that I seek after; indeed I don\\u2019t even know that I have ever tasted them.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cYou really think not?\\u201d he replied. \\u201cWell, it may be, no, wait a minute now, yes, after all that must be what you like best, I can see it now clearly, I am certain of it.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 As certainly, he did not succeed in convincing me; and yet I was already feeling happier, less restricted. After what M. de Norpois had said to me, I had regarded my moments of dreaming, of enthusiasm, of self-confidence as purely subjective and barren of truth. But according to Bergotte, who appeared to understand my case, it seemed that it was quite the contrary, that the symptom I ought to disregard was, in fact, my doubts, my disgust with myself. Moreover, what he had said about M. de Norpois took most of the sting out of a sentence from which I had supposed that no appeal was possible  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cAre you being properly looked after?\\u201d Bergotte asked me. \\u201cWho is treating you?\\u201d I told him that I had seen, and should probably go on seeing, Cottard. \\u201cBut that\\u2019s not at all the sort of man you want!\\u201d he told me. \\u201cI know nothing about him as a doctor. But I\\u2019ve met him at Mme. Swann\\u2019s. The man\\u2019s an imbecile. Even supposing that that doesn\\u2019t prevent his being a good doctor, which I hesitate to believe, it does prevent his being a good doctor for artists, for men of intelligence. People like you must have suitable doctors, I would almost go so far as to say treatment and medicines specially adapted to themselves. Cottard will bore you, and that alone will prevent his treatment from having any effect. Besides, the proper course of treatment cannot possibly be the same for you as for any Tom, Dick or Harry. Nine tenths of the ills from which intelligent people suffer spring from their intellect. They need at least a doctor who understands their disease. How do you e pect that Cottard should be able to treat you, he has made allowances for the difficulty of digesting sauces, for gastric trouble, but he has made no allowance for the effect of reading Shakespeare. So that his calculations are inaccurate in your case, the balance is upset; you see, always the little bottle-imp bobbing up again. He will find that you have a dilated stomach; he has no need to e amine you for it, since he has it already in his eye. You can see it there, reflected in his glasses.\\u201d This manner of speaking tired me greatly; I said to myself, with the stupidity of common sense: \\u201cThere is no more any dilated stomach reflected in Professor Cottard\\u2019s glasses than there are inanities stored behind the white waistcoat of M. de Norpois.\\u201d \\u201cI should recommend you, instead,\\u201d went on Bergotte, \\u201cto consult Dr. du Boulbon, who is quite an intelligent man.\\u201d \\u201cHe is a great admirer of your books,\\u201d I replied. I saw that Bergotte knew this, and I decided that kindred spirits soon come together, that one has few really \\u2018unknown friends.\\u2019 What Bergotte had said to me with respect to Cottard impressed me, while running contrary to everything that I myself believed. I was in no way disturbed by finding my doctor a bore; I e pected of him that, thanks to an art the laws of which were beyond me, he should pronounce on the subject of my health an infallible oracle, after consultation of my entrails. And I did not at all require that, with the aid of an intellect, in which I easily outstripped him, he should seek to understand my intellect, which I pictured to myself merely as a means, of no importance in itself, of trying to attain to certain e ternal verities. I doubted greatly whether intellectual people required a different form of hygiene from imbeciles, and I was quite prepared to submit myself to the latter kind. \\u201cI\\u2019ll tell you who does need a good doctor, and that is our friend Swann,\\u201d said Bergotte. And on my asking whether he was ill, \\u201cWell, don\\u2019t you see, he\\u2019s typical of the man who has married a whore, and has to swallow a hundred serpents every day, from women who refuse to meet his wife, or men who were there before him. You can see them in his mouth, writhing. Just look, any day you\\u2019re there, at the way he lifts his eyebrows when he comes in, to see who\\u2019s in the room.\\u201d The malice with which Bergotte spoke thus to a stranger of the friends in whose house he had so long been received as a welcome guest was as new to me as the almost amorous tone which, in that house, he had constantly been adopting to speak to them. Certainly a person like my great-aunt, for instance, would have been incapable of treating any of us with that politeness which I had heard Bergotte lavishing upon Swann. Even to the people whom she liked, she enjoyed saying disagreeable things. But behind their backs she would never have uttered a word to which they might not have listened. There was nothing less like the social \\u2018world\\u2019 than our society at Combray. The Swanns\\u2019 house marked a stage on the way towards it, towards its inconstant tide. If they had not yet reached the open sea, they were certainly in the lagoon. \\u201cThis is all between ourselves,\\u201d said Bergotte as he left me outside my own door. A few years later I should have answered: \\u201cI never repeat things.\\u201d That is the ritual phrase of society, from which the slanderer always derives a false reassurance. It is what I should have said then and there to Bergotte, for one does not invent all one\\u2019s speeches, especially when one is acting merely as a card in the social pack. But I did not yet know the formula. What my great-aunt, on the other hand, would have said on a similar occasion was: \\u201cIf you don\\u2019t wish it to be repeated, why do you say it?\\u201d That is the answer of the unsociable, of the quarrelsome. I was nothing of that sort: I bowed my head in silence  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Men of letters who were in my eyes persons of considerable importance had had to plot for years before they succeeded in forming with Bergotte relations which continued to the end to be but dimly literary, and never emerged beyond the four walls of his study, whereas I, I had now been installed among the friends of the great writer, at the first attempt and without any effort, like a man who, instead of standing outside in a crowd for hours in order to secure a bad seat in a theatre, is shewn in at once to the best, having entered by a door that is closed to the public. If Swann had thus opened such a door to me, it was doubtless because, just as a king finds himself naturally inviting his children\\u2019s friends into the royal bo , or on board the royal yacht, so Gilberte\\u2019s parents received their daughter\\u2019s friends among all the precious things that they had in their house, and the even more precious intimacies that were enshrined there. But at that time I thought, and perhaps was right in thinking, that this friendliness on Swann\\u2019s part was aimed indirectly at my parents. I seemed to remember having heard once at Combray that he had suggested to them that, in view of my admiration for Bergotte, he should take me to dine with him, and that my parents had declined, saying that I was too young, and too easily e cited to \\u2018go out\\u2019 yet. My parents, no doubt, represented to certain other people precisely those who seemed to me the most marvellous something quite different from what they were to me, so that, just as when the lady in pink had paid my father a tribute of which he had shewn himself so unworthy, I should have wished them to understand what an inestimable present I had just received, and to testify their gratitude to that generous and courteous Swann who had offered it to me, or to them rather, without seeming any more to be conscious of its value than is, in Luini\\u2019s fresco, the charming Mage with the arched nose and fair hair, to whom, it appeared, Swann had at one time been thought to bear a striking resemblance  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Unfortunately, this favour that Swann had done me, which, as I entered the house, before I had even taken off my greatcoat, I reported to my parents, in the hope that it would awaken in their hearts an emotion equal to my own, and would determine them upon some immense and decisive act of politeness towards the Swanns, did not appear to be greatly appreciated by them. \\u201cSwann  duced you to Bergotte? An e cellent friend for you, charming society!\\u201d cried my father, ironically. \\u201cIt only wanted that!\\u201d Alas, when I had gone on to say that Bergotte was by no means inclined to admire M. de Norpois:  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cI dare say!\\u201d retorted my father. \\u201cThat simply proves that he\\u2019s a foolish and evil-minded fellow. My poor boy, you never had much common sense, still, I\\u2019m sorry to see you fall among a set that will finish you off altogether.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Already the mere fact of my frequenting the Swanns had been far from delighting my parents. This  duction to Bergotte seemed to them a fatal but natural consequence of an original mistake, namely their own weakness in controlling me, which my grandfather would have called a \\u2018want of circumspection.\\u2019 I felt that I had only, in order to complete their ill humour, to tell them that this per fellow who did not appreciate M. de Norpois had found me e tremely intelligent. For I had observed that whenever my father decided that anyone, one of my school friends for instance, was going astray \\u2014 as I was at that moment \\u2014 if that person had the approval of somebody whom my father did not rate high, he would see in this testimony the confirmation of his own stern judgment. The evil merely seemed to him more pronounced. I could hear him already e claiming, \\u201cOf course, it all hangs together,\\u201d an e pression that terrified me by the vagueness and vastness of the reforms the  duction of which into my quiet life it seemed to threaten. But since, were I not to tell them what Bergotte had said of me, even then nothing could efface the impression my parents had formed, that this should be made slightly worse mattered little. Besides, they seemed to me so unfair, so completely mistaken, that not only had I not any hope, I had scarcely any desire to bring them to a more equitable point of view. At the same time, feeling, as the words came from my lips, how alarmed they would be by the thought that I had found favour in the sight of a person who dismissed clever men as fools and had earned the contempt of all decent people, praise from whom, since it seemed to me a thing to be desired, would only encourage me in wrongdoing, it was in faltering tones and with a slightly shamefaced air that, coming to the end of my story, I flung them the bouquet of: \\u201cHe told the Swanns that he had found me e tremely intelligent.\\u201d Just as a poisoned dog, in a field, rushes, without knowing why, straight to the grass which is the precise antidote to the to in that he has swallowed, so I, without in the least suspecting it, had said the one thing in the world that was capable of overcoming in my parents this prejudice with respect to Bergotte, a prejudice which all the best reasons that I could have urged, all the tributes that I could have paid him, must have proved powerless to defeat. Instantly the situation changed  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cOh! He said that he found you intelligent,\\u201d repeated my mother. \\u201cI am glad to hear that, because he is a man of talent.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cWhat! He said that, did he?\\u201d my father joined in. \\u201cI don\\u2019t for a moment deny his literary distinction, before which the whole world bows; only it is a pity that he should lead that scarcely reputable e istence to which old Norpois made a guarded allusion, when he was here,\\u201d he went on, not seeing that against the sovran virtue of the magic words which I had just repeated the depravity of Bergotte\\u2019s morals was little more able to contend than the falsity of his judgment  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 But, my dear,\\u201d Mamma interrupted, \\u201cwe\\u2019ve no proof that it\\u2019s true. People say all sorts of things. Besides M. de Norpois may have the most perfect manners in the world, but he\\u2019s not always very good-natured, especially about people who are not e actly his sort.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cThat\\u2019s quite true; I\\u2019ve noticed it myself,\\u201d my father admitted  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cAnd then, too, a great deal ought to be forgiven Bergotte, since he thinks well of my little son,\\u201d Mamma went on, stroking my hair with her fingers and fastening upon me a long and pensive gaze  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 My mother had not, indeed, awaited this verdict from Bergotte before telling me that I might ask Gilberte to tea whenever I had friends coming. But I dared not do so for two reasons. The first was that at Gilberte\\u2019s there was never anything else to drink but tea. Whereas at home Mamma insisted on there being a pot of chocolate as well. I was afraid that Gilberte might regard this as \\u2018common\\u2019; and so conceive a great contempt for us. The other reason was a formal difficulty, a question of procedure which I could never succeed in settling. When I arrived at Mme. Swann\\u2019s she used to ask me: \\u201cAnd how is your mother?\\u201d I had made several overtures to Mamma to find out whether she would do the same when Gilberte came to us, a point which seemed to me more serious than, at the Court of Louis XIV, the use of \\u2018Monseigneur.\\u2019 But Mamma would not hear of it for a moment  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cCertainly not. I do not know Mme. Swann.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cBut neither does she know you.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cI never said she did, but we are not obliged to behave in e actly the same way about everything. I shall find other ways of being civil to Gilberte than Mme. Swann has with you.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 But I was unconvinced, and preferred not to invite Gilberte  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Leaving my parents, I went upstairs to change my clothes and on emptying my pockets came suddenly upon the envelope which the Swanns\\u2019 butler had handed me before shewing me into the drawing-room. I was now alone. I opened it; inside was a card on which I was told the name of the lady whom I ought to have \\u2018taken in\\u2019 to luncheon  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 It was about this period that Bloch overthrew my conception of the world and opened for me fresh possibilities of happiness which, for that matter, were to change later on into possibilities of suffering, by assuring me that, in contradiction of all that I had believed at the time of my walks along the M\\u00e9s\\u00e9glise way, women never asked for anything better than to make love. He added to this service a second, the value of which I was not to appreciate until much later; it was he who took me for the first time into a disorderly house. He had indeed told me that there were any number of pretty women whom one might enjoy. But I could see them only in a vague outline for which those houses were to enable me to substitute actual human features. So that if I owed to Bloch \\u2014 for his \\u2018good tidings\\u2019 that beauty and the enjoyment of beauty were not inaccessible things, and that we have acted foolishly in renouncing them for all time \\u2014 a debt of gratitude of the same kind that we owe to an optimistic physician or philosopher who has given us reason to hope for length of days in this world and not to be entirely cut off from it when we shall have passed beyond the veil, the houses of assignation which I began to frequent some years later \\u2014 by furnishing me with specimens of beauty, by allowing me to add to the beauty of women that element which we are powerless to invent, which is something more than a mere summary of former beauties, that present indeed divine, the one present that we cannot bestow upon ourselves, before which faint and fail all the logical creations of our intellect, and which we can seek from reality alone: an individual charm \\u2014 deserved to be ranked by me with those other benefactors more recent in origin but of comparable utility before finding which we used to imagine without any warmth the seductive charms of Mantegna, of Wagner, of Siena, by studying other painters, hearing other composers, visiting other cities: namely illustrated editions of the history of painting, symphonic concerts and handbooks to \\u2018Mediaeval Towns.\\u2019 But the house to which Bloch led me and which he himself, for that matter, had long ceased to visit, was of too humble a grade, its denizens were too inconspicuous and too little varied to be able to satisfy my old or to stimulate new curiosities. The mistress of this house knew none of the women with whom one asked her to negotiate, and was always suggesting others whom one did not want. She boasted to me of one in particular, one of whom, with a smile full of promise as though this had been a great rarity and a special treat she would whisper: \\u201cShe is a Jewess! Doesn\\u2019t that make you want to?\\u201d That, by the way, was probably why the girl\\u2019s name was Rachel. And with a silly and affected e citement which, she hoped, would prove contagious, and which ended in a hoarse gurgle, almost of sensual satisfaction: \\u201cThink of that, my boy, a Jewess! Wouldn\\u2019t that be lovely? Rrrr!\\u201d This Rachel, of whom I caught a glimpse without her seeing me, was dark and not good looking, but had an air of intelligence, and would pass the tip of her tongue over her lips as she smiled, with a look of boundless impertinence, at the \\u2018boys\\u2019 who were  duced to her and whom I could hear making conversation. Her small and narrow face was framed in short curls of black hair, irregular as though they were outlined in pen-strokes upon a wash-drawing in Indian ink. Every evening I promised the old woman who offered her to me with a special insistence, boasting of her superior intelligence and her education, that I would not fail to come some day on purpose to make the acquaintance of Rachel, whom I had nicknamed \\u201cRachel when from the Lord.\\u201d But the first evening I had heard her, as she was leaving the house, say to the mistress: \\u201cThat\\u2019s settled then; I shall be free to-morrow, if you have anyone you won\\u2019t forget to send for me.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 And these words had prevented me from recognising her as a person because they had made me classify her at once in a general category of women whose habit, common to all of them, was to come there in the evening to see whether there might not be a louis or two to be earned. She would simply vary her formula, saying indifferently: \\u201cIf you want me\\u201d or \\u201cIf you want anybody.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 The mistress, who was not familiar with Hal\\u00e9vy\\u2019s opera, did not know why I always called the girl \\u201cRachel when from the Lord.\\u201d But failure to understand a joke has never yet made anyone find it less amusing, and it was always with a whole-hearted laugh that she would say to me:  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cThen there\\u2019s nothing doing to-night? When am I going to fi  you up with \\u2018Rachel when from the Lord\\u2019? Why do you always say that, \\u2018Rachel when from the Lord\\u2019? Oh, that\\u2019s very smart, that is. I\\u2019m going to make a match of you two. You won\\u2019t be sorry for it, you\\u2019ll see.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Once I was just making up my mind, but she was \\u2018in the press,\\u2019 another time in the hands of the hairdresser, an elderly gentleman who never did anything for the women e cept pour oil on their loosened hair and then comb it. And I grew tired of waiting, even though several of the humbler frequenters of the place working girls, they called themselves, but they always seemed to be out of work, had come to mi  drinks for me and to hold long conversations to which, despite the gravity of the subjects discussed, the partial or total nudity of the speakers gave an attractive simplicity. I ceased moreover to go to this house because, an ious to present a token of my good-will to the woman who kept it and was in need of furniture, I had given her several pieces, notably a big sofa, which I had inherited from my aunt L\\u00e9onie. I used never to see them, for want of space had prevented my parents from taking them in at home, and they were stored in a warehouse. But as soon as I discovered them again in the house where these women were putting them to their own uses, all the virtues that one had imbibed in the air of my aunt\\u2019s room at Combray became apparent to me, tortured by the cruel contact to which I had abandoned them in their helplessness! Had I outraged the dead, I should not have suffered such remorse. I returned no more to visit their new mistress, for they seemed to me to be alive, and to be appealing to me, like those objects, apparently inanimate, in a Persian fairy-tale, in which are embodied human souls that are undergoing martyrdom and plead for deliverance. Besides, as our memory presents things to us, as a rule, not in their chronological sequence but as it were by a refle ion in which the order of the parts is reversed, I remembered only long afterwards that it was upon that same sofa that, many years before, I had tasted for the first time the sweets of love with one of my girl cousins, with whom I had not known where to go until she somewhat rashly suggested our taking advantage of a moment in which aunt L\\u00e9onie had left her room  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 A whole lot more of my aunt L\\u00e9onie\\u2019s things, and notably a magnificent set of old silver plate, I sold, in spite of my parents\\u2019 warnings, so as to have more money to spend, and to be able to send more flowers to Mme. Swann who would greet me, after receiving an immense basket of orchids, with: \\u201cIf I were your father, I should have you up before the magistrate for this.\\u201d How was I to suppose that one day I might regret more than anything the loss of my silver plate, and rank certain other pleasures more highly than that which would have shrunk perhaps into none at all of bestowing favours upon Gilberte\\u2019s parents. Similarly, it was with Gilberte in my mind, and so as not to be separated from her, that I had decided not to enter a career of diplomacy abroad. It is always thus, impelled by a state of mind which is destined not to last, that we make our irrevocable decisions. I could scarcely imagine that that strange substance which was housed in Gilberte, and from her permeated her parents and her home, leaving me indifferent to all things else, could be liberated from her, could migrate into another person. The same substance, unquestionable, and yet one that would have a wholly different effect on me. For a single malady goes through various evolutions, and a delicious poison can no longer be taken with the same impunity when, with the passing of the years, the heart\\u2019s power of resistance has diminished  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 My parents meanwhile would have liked to see the intelligence that Bergotte had discerned in me made manifest in some remarkable achievement. When I still did not know the Swanns I thought that I was prevented from working by the state of agitation into which I was thrown by the impossibility of seeing Gilberte when I chose. But, now that their door stood open to me, scarcely had I sat down at my desk than I would rise and run to them. And after I had left them and was at home again, my isolation was only apparent, my mind was powerless to swim against the stream of words on which I had allowed myself mechanically to be borne for hours on end. Sitting alone, I continued to fashion remarks such as might have pleased or amused the Swanns, and to make this pastime more entertaining I myself took the parts of those absent players, I put to myself imagined questions, so chosen that my brilliant epigrams served merely as happy answers to them. Though conducted in silence, this e ercise was none the less a conversation and not a meditation, my solitude a mental society in which it was not I myself but other imaginary speakers who controlled my choice of words, and in which I felt as I formulated, in place of the thoughts that I believed to be true, those that came easily to my mind, and involved no  spection from without, that kind of pleasure, entirely passive, which sitting still affords to anyone who is burdened with a sluggish digestion  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Had I been less firmly resolved upon setting myself definitely to work, I should perhaps have made an effort to begin at once. But since my resolution was e plicit, since within twenty-four hours, in the empty frame of that long morrow in which everything was so well arranged because I myself had not yet entered it, my good intentions would be realised without difficulty, it was better not to select an evening on which I was ill-disposed for a beginning for which the following days were not, alas, to shew themselves any more propitious. But I was reasonable. It would have been puerile, on the part of one who had waited now for years, not to put up with a postponement of two or three days. Confident that by the day after ne t I should have written several pages, I said not a word more to my parents of my decision; I preferred to remain patient for a few hours and then to bring to a convinced and comforted grandmother a sample of work that was already under way. Unfortunately the morrow was not that vast, e ternal day to which I in my fever had looked forward. When it drew to a close, my laziness and my painful struggle to overcome certain internal obstacles had simply lasted twenty-four hours longer. And at the end of several days, my plans not having matured, I had no longer the same hope that they would be realised at once, no longer the courage, therefore, to subordinate everything else to their realisation: I began again to keep late hours, having no longer, to oblige me to go to bed early on any evening, the certain hope of seeing my work begun ne t morning. I needed, before I could recover my creative energy, several days of rela ation, and the only time that my grandmother ventured, in a gentle and disillusioned tone, to frame the reproach: \\u201cWell, and that work of yours; aren\\u2019t we even to speak of it now?\\u201d I resented her intrusion, convinced that in her inability to see that my mind was irrevocably made up, she had further and perhaps for a long time postponed the e ecution of my task, by the shock which her denial of justice to me had given my nerves, since until I had recovered from that shock I should not feel inclined to begin my work. She felt that her scepticism had charged blindly into my intention. She apologised, kissing me: \\u201cI am sorry; I shall not say anything again,\\u201d and, so that I should not be discouraged, assured me that, from the day on which I should be quite well again, the work would come of its own accord from my superfluity of strength  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Besides, I said to myself, in spending all my time with the Swanns, am I not doing e actly what Bergotte does? To my parents it seemed almost as though, idle as I was, I was leading, since it was spent in the same drawing-room with a great writer, the life most favourable to the growth of talent. And yet the assumption that anyone can be dispensed from having to create that talent for himself, from within himself, and can acquire it from some one else, is as impossible as it would be to suppose that a man can keep himself in good health, in spite of neglecting all the rules of hygiene and of indulging in the worst e cesses, merely by dining out often in the company of a physician. The person, by the way, who was most completely taken in by this illusion, which misled me as well as my parents, was Mme. Swann. When I e plained to her that I was unable to come, that I must stay at home and work, she looked as though she were thinking that I made a great fuss about nothing, that there was something foolish as well as ostentatious in what I had said  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cBut Bergotte is coming, isn\\u2019t he? Do you mean that you don\\u2019t think it good, what he writes? It will be better still, very soon,\\u201d she went on, \\u201cfor he is more pointed, he concentrates more in newspaper articles than in his books, where he is apt to spread out too much. I\\u2019ve arranged that in future he\\u2019s to do the leading articles in the Figaro. He\\u2019ll be distinctly the \\u2018right man in the right place\\u2019 there.\\u201d And, finally, \\u201cCome! He will tell you, better than anyone, what you ought to do.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 And so, just as one invites a gentleman ranker to meet his colonel, it was in the interests of my career, and as though masterpieces of literature arose out of \\u2018getting to know\\u201d people, that she told me not to fail to come to dinner with her ne t day, to meet Bergotte  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 And so there was not from the Swanns any more than from my parents, that is to say from those who, at different times, had seemed bound to place obstacles in my way, any further opposition to that pleasant e istence in which I might see Gilberte as often as I chose, with enjoyment if not with peace of mind. There can be no peace of mind in love, since the advantage one has secured is never anything but a fresh starting-point for further desires. So long as I had not been free to go to her, having my eyes fi ed upon that inaccessible goal of happiness, I could not so much as imagine the fresh grounds for an iety that lay in wait for me there. Once the resistance of her parents was broken, and the problem solved at last, it began to set itself anew, and always in different terms. Each evening, on arriving home, I reminded myself that I had things to say to Gilberte of prime importance, things upon which our whole friendship hung, and these things were never the same. But at least I was happy, and no further menace arose to threaten my happiness. One was to appear, alas, from a quarter in which I had never detected any peril, namely from Gilberte and myself. And yet I ought to have been tormented by what, on the contrary, reassured me, by what I mistook for happiness. We are, when we love, in an abnormal state, capable of giving at once to an accident, the most simple to all appearance and one that may at any moment occur, a serious-aspect which that accident by itself would not bear. What makes us so happy is the presence in our heart of an unstable element which we are perpetually arranging to keep in position, and of which we cease almost to be aware so long as it is not displaced. Actually, there is in love a permanent strain of suffering which happiness neutralises, makes conditional only, procrastinates, but which may at any moment become what it would long since have been had we not obtained what we were seeking, sheer agony  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 On several occasions I felt that Gilberte was an ious to put off my visits. It is true that when I was at all an ious to see her I had only to get myself invited by her parents who were increasingly persuaded of my e cellent influence over her. \\u201cThanks to them,\\u201d I used to think, \\u201cmy love is running no risk; the moment I have them on my side, I can set my mind at rest; they have full authority over Gilberte.\\u201d Until, alas, I detected certain signs of impatience which she allowed to escape her when her father made me come to the house, almost against her will, and asked myself whether what I had regarded as a protection for my happiness was not in fact the secret reason why that happiness could not endure  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 The last time that I called to see Gilberte, it was raining; she had been asked to a dancing lesson in the house of some people whom she knew too slightly to be able to take me there with her. In view of the dampness of the air I had taken rather more caffeine than usual. Perhaps on account of the weather, or because she had some objection to the house in which this party was being given, Mme. Swann, as her daughter was leaving the room, called her back in the sharpest of tones: \\u201cGilberte!\\u201d and pointed to me, to indicate that I had come there to see her and that she ought to stay with me. This \\u2018Gilberte!\\u2019 had been uttered, or shouted rather, with the best of intentions towards myself, but from the way in which Gilberte shrugged her shoulders as she took off her outdoor clothes I divined that her mother had unwittingly hastened the gradual evolution, which until then it had perhaps been possible to arrest, which was gradually drawing away from me my friend. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t need to go out dancing every day,\\u201d Odette told her daughter, with a sagacity acquired, no doubt, in earlier days, from Swann. Then, becoming once more Odette, she began speaking to her daughter in English. At once it was as though a wall had sprung up to hide from me a part of the life of Gilberte, as though an evil genius had spirited my friend far away. In a language that we know, we have substituted for the opacity of sounds, the perspicuity of ideas. But a language which we do not know is a fortress sealed, within whose walls she whom we love is free to play us false, while we, standing without, desperately alert in our impotence, can see, can prevent nothing. So this conversation in English, at which, a month earlier, I should merely have smiled, interspersed with a few proper names in French which did not fail to accentuate, to give a point to my uneasiness, had, when conducted within a few feet of me by two motionless persons, the same degree of cruelty, left me as much abandoned and alone as the forcible abduction of my companion. At length Mme. Swann left us. That day, perhaps from resentment against myself, the unwilling cause of her not going out to enjoy herself, perhaps also because, guessing her to be angry with me, I was precautionally colder than usual with her, the face of Gilberte, divested of every sign of joy, bleak, bare, pillaged, seemed all afternoon to be devoting a melancholy regret to the pas-de-quatre in which my arrival had prevented her from going to take part, and to be defying every living creature, beginning with myself, to understand the subtle reasons that had determined in her a sentimental attachment to the boston. She confined herself to e changing with me, now and again, on the weather, the increasing violence of the rain, the fastness of the clock, a conversation punctuated with silences and monosyllables, in which I lashed myself on, with a sort of desperate rage, to the destruction of those moments which we might have devoted to friendship and happiness. And on each of our remarks was stamped, as it were, a supreme harshness, by the paro ysm of their stupefying unimportance, which at the same time consoled me, for it prevented Gilberte from being taken in by the banality of my observations and the indifference of my tone. In vain was my polite: \\u201cI thought, the other day, that the clock was slow, if anything\\u201d; she evidently understood me to mean: \\u201cHow tiresome you are being!\\u201d Obstinately as I might protract, over the whole length of that rain-sodden afternoon, the dull cloud of words through which no fitful ray shone, I knew that my coldness was not so unalterably fi ed as I pretended, and that Gilberte must be fully aware that if, after already saying it to her three times, I had hazarded a fourth repetition of the statement that the evenings were drawing in, I should have had difficulty in restraining myself from bursting into tears. When she was like that, when no smile filled her eyes or unveiled her face, I cannot describe the devastating monotony that stamped her melancholy eyes and sullen features. Her face, grown almost livid, reminded me then of those dreary beaches where the sea, ebbing far out, wearies one with its faint shimmering, everywhere the same, fi ed in an immutable and low horizon. At length, as I saw no sign in Gilberte of the happy change for which I had been waiting now for some hours, I told her that she was not being nice. \\u201cIt is you that are not being nice,\\u201d was her answer. \\u201cOh, but surely \\u2014\\u2014!\\u201d I asked myself what I could have done, and, finding no answer, put the question to her. \\u201cNaturally, you think yourself nice!\\u201d she said to me with a laugh, and went on laughing. Whereupon I felt all the anguish that there was for me in not being able to attain to that other, less perceptible, plane of her mind which her laughter indicated. It seemed, that laughter, to mean: \\u201cNo, no, I\\u2019m not going to let myself be moved by anything that you say, I know you\\u2019re madly in love with me, but that leaves me neither hot nor cold, for I don\\u2019t care a rap for you.\\u201d But I told myself that, after all, laughter was not a language so well defined that I could be certain of understanding what this laugh really meant. And Gilberte\\u2019s words were affectionate. \\u201cBut how am I not being nice?\\u201d I asked her. \\u201cTell me; I will do anything you want.\\u201d \\u201cNo; that wouldn\\u2019t be any good. I can\\u2019t e plain.\\u201d For a moment I was afraid that she thought that I did not love her, and this was for me a fresh agony, no less keen, but one that required treatment by a different conversational method. \\u201cIf you knew how much you were hurting me you would tell me.\\u201d But this pain which, had she doubted my love for her, must have rejoiced her, seemed instead to make her more angry. Then, realising my mistake, making up my mind to pay no more attention to what she said, letting her without bothering to believe her assure me: \\u201cI do love you, indeed I do; you will see one day,\\u201d that day on which the guilty are convinced that their innocence will be made clear, and which, for some mysterious reason, never happens to be the day on which their evidence is taken, I had the courage to make a sudden resolution not to see her again, and without telling her of it yet since she would not have believed me  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Grief that is caused one by a person with whom one is in love can be bitter, even when it is interpolated among preoccupations, occupations, pleasures in which that person is not directly involved and from which our attention is diverted only now and again to return to it. But when such a grief has its birth \\u2014 as was now happening \\u2014 at a moment when the happiness of seeing that person fills us to the e clusion of all else, the sharp depression that then affects our spirits, sunny hitherto, sustained and calm, lets loose in us a raging tempest against which we know not whether we are capable of struggling to the end. The tempest that was blowing in my heart was so violent that I made my way home baffled, battered, feeling that I could recover my breath only by retracing my steps, by returning, upon whatever prete t, into Gilberte\\u2019s presence. But she would have said to herself: \\u201cBack again! Evidently I can go to any length with him; he will come back every time, and the more wretched he is when he leaves me the more docile he\\u2019ll be.\\u201d Besides, I was irresistibly drawn towards her in thought, and those alternative orientations, that mad careering between them of the compass-needle within me, persisted after I had reached home, and e pressed themselves in the mutually contradictory letters to Gilberte which I began to draft  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 I was about to pass through one of those difficult crises which we generally find that we have to face at various stages in life, and which, for all that there has been no change in our character, in our nature that nature which itself creates our loves, and almost creates the women whom we love, even to their faults, we do not face in the same way on each occasion, that is to say at every age. At such moments our life is divided, and so to speak distributed over a pair of scales, in two counterpoised pans which between them contain it all. In one there is our desire not to displease, not to appear too humble to the creature whom we love without managing to understand her, but whom we find it more convenient at times to appear almost to disregard, so that she shall not have that sense of her own indis-pensability which may turn her from us; in the other scale there is a feeling of pain \\u2014 and one that is not localised and partial only \\u2014 which cannot be set at rest unless, abandoning every thought of pleasing the woman and of making her believe that we can dispense with her, we go at once to find her. When we withdraw from the pan in which our pride lies a small quantity of the will-power which we have weakly allowed to e haust itself with increasing age, when we add to the pan that holds our suffering a physical pain which we have acquired and have let grow, then, instead of the courageous solution that would have carried the day at one-and-twenty, it is the other, grown too heavy and insufficiently balanced, that crushes us down at fifty. All the more because situations, while repeating them-.selves, tend to alter, and there is every likelihood that, in middle life or in old age, we shall have had the grim satisfaction of complicating our love by an intrusion of habit which adolescence, repressed by other demands upon it, less master of itself, has never known  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 I had just written Gilberte a letter in which I allowed the tempest of my wrath to thunder, not however without throwing her the lifebuoy of a few words disposed as though by accident on the page, by clinging to which my friend might be brought to a reconciliation; a moment later, the wind having changed, they were phrases full of love that I addressed to her, chosen for the sweetness of certain forlorn e pressions, those \\u2018nevermores\\u2019 so touching to those who pen them, so wearisome to her who will have to read them, whether she believe them to be false and translate \\u2018nevermore\\u2019 by \\u2018this very evening, if you want me,\\u2019 or believe them to be true and so to be breaking the news to her of one of those final separations which make so little difference to our lives when the other person is one with whom we are not in love. But since we are incapable, while we are in love, of acting as fit predecessors of the ne t persons whom we shall presently have become, and who will then be in love no longer, how are we to imagine the actual state of mind of a woman whom, even when we are conscious that we are of no account to her, we have perpetually represented in our musings as uttering, so as to lull us into a happy dream or to console us for a great sorrow, the same speeches that she would make if she loved us. When we come to e amine the thoughts, the actions of a woman whom we love, we are as completely at a loss as must have been, face to face with the phenomena of nature, the world\\u2019s first natural philosophers, before their science had been elaborated and had cast a ray of light over the unknown. Or, worse still, we are like a person in whose mind the law of causality barely e ists, a person who would be incapable, therefore, of establishing any conne ion between one phenomenon and another, to whose eyes the spectacle of the world would appear unstable as a dream. Of course I made efforts to emerge from this incoherence, to find reasons for things. I tried even to be \\u2018objective\\u2019 and, to that end, to bear well in mind the disproportion that e isted between the importance which Gilberte had in my eyes and that, not only which I had in hers, but which she herself had in the eyes of other people, a disproportion which, had I failed to remark it, would have involved my mistaking mere friendliness on my friend\\u2019s part for a passionate avowal, and a grotesque and debasing display on my own for the simple and graceful movement with which we are attracted towards a pretty face. But I was afraid also of falling into the contrary error, in which I should have seen in Gilberte\\u2019s unpunctuality in keeping an appointment an irremediable hostility. I tried to discover between these two perspectives, equally distorting, a third which would enable me to see things as they really were; the calculations I was obliged to make with that object helped to take my mind off my sufferings; and whether in obedience to the laws of arithmetic or because I had made them give me the answer that I desired, I made up my mind that ne t day I would go to the Swanns\\u2019, happy, but happy in the same way as people who, having long been tormented by the thought of a journey which they have not wished to make, go no farther than to the station and return home to unpack their bo es. And since, while one is hesitating, the bare idea of a possible resolution unless one has rendered that idea sterile by deciding that one will make no resolution develops, like a seed in the ground, the lineaments, every detail of the emotions that will be born from the performance of the action, I told myself that it had been quite absurd of me to be as much hurt by the suggestion that I should not see Gilberte again as if I had really been about to put that suggestion into practice, and that since, on the contrary, I was to end by returning to her side, I might have saved myself the e pense of all those vain longings and painful acceptances. But this resumption of friendly relations lasted only so long as it took me to reach the Swanns\\u2019; not because their butler, who was really fond of me, told me that Gilberte had gone out a statement the truth of which was confirmed, as it happened, the same evening, by people who had seen her somewhere, but because of the manner in which he said it. \\u201cSir, the young lady is not at home; I can assure you, sir, that I am speaking the truth. If you wish to make any inquiries I can fetch the young lady\\u2019s maid. You know very well, sir, that I would do everything in my power to oblige you, and that if the young lady was at home I would take you to her at once.\\u201d These words being of the only kind that is really important, that is to say spontaneous, the kind that gives us a radiograph shewing the main points, at any rate, of the unimaginable reality which would be wholly concealed beneath a prepared speech, proved that in Gilberte\\u2019s household there was an impression that I bothered her with my visits; and so, scarcely had the man uttered them before they had aroused in me a hatred of which I preferred to make him rather than Gilberte the victim; he drew upon his own head all the angry feelings that I might have had for my friend; freed from these complications, thanks to his words, my love subsisted alone; but his words had, at the same time, shewn me that I must cease for the present to attempt to see Gilberte. She would be certain to write to me, to apologise. In spite of which, I should not return at once to see her, so as to prove to her that I was capable of living without her. Besides, once I had received her letter, Gilberte\\u2019s society was a thing with which I should be more easily able to dispense for a time, since I should be certain of finding her ready to receive me whenever I chose. All that I needed in order to support with less pain the burden of a voluntary separation was to feel that my heart was rid of the terrible uncertainty whether we were not irreconcilably sundered, whether she had not promised herself to another, left Paris, been taken away by force. The days that followed resembled the first week of that old New Year which I had had to spend alone, without Gilberte. But when that week had dragged to its end, then for one thing my friend would be coming again to the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es, I should be seeing her as before; I had been sure of that; for another thing, I had known with no less certainty that so long as the New Year holidays lasted it would not be worth my while to go to the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es, which meant that during that miserable week, which was already ancient history, I had endured my wretchedness with a quiet mind because there was blended in it neither fear nor hope. Now, on the other hand, it was the latter of these which, almost as much as my fear of what might happen, rendered intolerable the burden of my grief. Not having had any letter from Gilberte that evening, I had attributed this to her carelessness, to her other occupations, I did not doubt that I should find something from her in the morning\\u2019s post. This I awaited, every day, with a beating heart which subsided, leaving me utterly prostrate, when I had found in it only letters from people who were not Gilberte, or else nothing at all, which was no worse, the proofs of another\\u2019s friendship making all the more cruel those of her indifference. I transferred my hopes to the afternoon post. Even between the times at which letters were delivered I dared not leave the house, for she might be sending hers by a messenger. Then, the time coming at last when neither the postman nor a footman from the Swanns\\u2019 could possibly appear that night, I must procrastinate my hope of being set at rest, and thus, because I believed that my sufferings were not destined to last, I was obliged, so to speak, incessantly to renew them. My disappointment was perhaps the same, but instead of just uniformly prolonging, as in the old days, an initial emotion, it began again several times daily, starting each time with an emotion so frequently renewed that it ended \\u2014 it, so purely physical, so instantaneous a state \\u2014 by becoming stabilised, so consistently that the strain of waiting having hardly time to rela  before a fresh reason for waiting supervened, there was no longer a single minute in the day in which I was not in that state of an iety which it is so difficult to bear even for an hour. So my punishment was infinitely more cruel than in those New Year holidays long ago, because this time there was in me, instead of the acceptance, pure and simple, of that punishment, the hope, at every moment, of seeing it come to an end. And yet at this state of acceptance I ultimately arrived; then I understood that it must be final, and I renounced Gilberte for ever, in the interests of my love itself and because I hoped above all that she would not retain any contemptuous memory of me. Indeed, from that moment, so that she should not be led to suppose any sort of lover\\u2019s spite on my part, when she made appointments for me to see her I used often to accept them and then, at the last moment, write to her that I was prevented from coming, but with the same protestations of my disappointment that I should have made to anyone whom I had not wished to see. These e pressions of regret, which we keep as a rule for people who do not matter, would do more, I imagined, to persuade Gilberte of my indifference than would the tone of indifference which we affect only to those whom we love. When, better than by mere words, by a course of action indefinitely repeated, I should have proved to her that I had no appetite for seeing her, perhaps she would discover once again an appetite for seeing me. Alas! I was doomed to failure; to attempt, by ceasing to see her, to reawaken in her that inclination to see me was to lose her for ever; first of all, because, when it began to revive, if I wished it to last I must not give way to it at once; besides, the most agonising hours would then have passed; it was at this very moment that she was indispensable to me, and I should have liked to be able to warn her that what presently she would have to assuage, by the act of seeing me again, would be a grief so far diminished as to be no longer what a moment ago it would still have been, nor the thought of putting an end to it, a motive towards surrender, reconciliation, further meetings. And then again, later on, when I should at last be able safely to confess to Gilberte so far would her liking for me have regained its strength my liking for her, the latter, not having been able to resist the strain of so long a separation, would have ceased to e ist; Gilberte would have become immaterial to me. I knew this, but I could not e plain it to her; she would have assumed that if I was pretending that I should cease to love her if I remained for too long without seeing her, that was solely in order that she might summon me back to her at once. In the meantime, what made it easier for me to sentence myself to this separation was the fact that in order to make it quite clear to her that despite my protestations to the contrary it was my own free will and not any conflicting engagement, not the state of my health that prevented me from seeing her, whenever I knew beforehand that Gilberte would not be in the house, was going out somewhere with a friend and would not be home for dinner, I went to see Mme. Swann who had once more become to me what she had been at the time when I had such difficulty in seeing her daughter and on days when the latter was not coming to the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es used to repair to the All\\u00e9e des Acacias. In this way I should be hearing about Gilberte, and could be certain that she would in due course hear about me, and in terms which would shew her that I was not interested in her. And I found, as all those who suffer find, that my melancholy condition might have been worse. For being free at any time to enter the habitation in which Gilberte dwelt, I constantly reminded myself, for all that I was firmly resolved to make no use of that privilege, that if ever my pain grew too sharp there was a way of making it cease. I was not unhappy, save only from day to day. And even that is an e aggeration. How many times in an hour but now without that an ious e pectancy which had strained every nerve of me in the first weeks after our quarrel, before I had gone again to the Swanns\\u2019 did I not repeat to myself the words of the letter which, one day soon, Gilberte would surely send, would perhaps even bring to me herself. The perpetual vision of that imagined happiness helped me to endure the desolation of my real happiness. With women who do not love Us, as with the \\u2018missing,\\u2019 the knowledge that there is no hope left does not prevent our continuing to wait for news. We live on tenterhooks, starting at the slightest sound; the mother whose son has gone to sea on some perilous voyage of discovery sees him in imagination every moment, long after the fact of his having perished has been established, striding into the room, saved by a miracle and in the best of health. And this strain of waiting, according to the strength of her memory and the resistance of her bodily organs, either helps her on her journey through the years, at the end of which she will be able to endure the knowledge that her son is no more, to forget gradually and to survive his loss, or else it kills her  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 On the other hand, my grief found consolation in the idea that my love must profit by it. Each visit that I paid to Mme. Swann without seeing Gilberte was a cruel punishment, but I felt that it correspondingly enhanced the idea that Gilberte had of me  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Besides, if I always took care, before going to see Mme. Swann, that there should be no risk of her daughter\\u2019s appearing, that arose, it is true, from my determination to break with her, but no less perhaps from that hope of reconciliation which overlay my intention to renounce her very few of such intentions are absolute, at least in a continuous form, in this human soul of ours, one of whose laws, confirmed by the unlooked-for wealth of illustration that memory supplies, is intermittence, and hid from me all that in it was unbearably cruel. As for that hope, I saw clearly how far it was chimerical. I was like a pauper who moistens his dry crust with fewer tears if he assures himself that, at any moment, a total stranger is perhaps going to leave him the whole of his fortune. We are all of us obliged, if we are to make reality endurable, to nurse a few little follies in ourselves. Now my hope remained more intact \\u2014 while at the same time our separation became more effectual \\u2014 if I refrained from meeting Gilberte. If I had found myself face to face with her in her mother\\u2019s drawing-room, we might perhaps have uttered irrevocable words which would have rendered our breach final, killed my hope and, on the other hand, by creating a fresh an iety, reawakened my love and made resignation harder  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Ever so long ago, before I had even thought of breaking with her daughter, Mme. Swann had said to me: \\u201cIt is all very well your coming to see Gilberte; I should like you to come sometimes for my sake, not to my \\u2018kettledrums,\\u2019 which would bore you because there is such a crowd, but on the other days, when you will always find me at home if you come fairly late.\\u201d So that I might be thought, when I came to see her, to be yielding only after a long resistance to a desire which she had e pressed in the past. And very late in the afternoon, when it was quite dark, almost at the hour at which my parents would be sitting down to dinner, I would set out to pay Mme. Swann a visit, in the course of which I knew that I should not see Gilberte, and yet should be thinking only of her. In that quarter, then looked upon as remote, of a Paris darker than Paris is to-day, where even in the centre there was no electric light in the public thoroughfares and very little in private houses, the lamps of a drawing-room situated on the ground level, or but slightly raised above it, as were the rooms in which Mme. Swann generally received her visitors, were enough to lighten the street, and to make the passer-by raise his eyes, connecting with their glow, as with its apparent though hidden cause, the presence outside the door of a string of smart broughams. This passer-by was led to believe, not without a certain emotion, that a modification had been effected in this mysterious cause, when he saw one of the carriages begin to move; but it was merely a coachman who, afraid of his horses\\u2019 catching cold, started them now and again on a brisk walk, all the more impressive because the rubber-tired wheels gave the sound of their hooves a background of silence from which it stood out more distinct and more e plicit  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 The \\u2018winter-garden,\\u2019 of which in those days the passer-by generally caught a glimpse, in whatever street he might be walking, if the drawing-room did not stand too high above the pavement, is to be seen to-day only in photogravures in the gift-books of P. J. Stahl, where, in contrast to the infrequent floral decorations of the Louis XVI drawing-rooms now in fashion \\u2014 a single rose or a Japanese iris in a long-necked vase of crystal into which it would be impossible to squeeze a second \\u2014 it seems, because of the profusion of indoor plants which people had then, and of the absolute want of style in their arrangement, as though it must have responded in the ladies whose houses it adorned to some living and delicious passion for botany rather than to any cold concern for lifeless decoration. It suggested to one, only on a larger scale, in the houses of those days, those tiny, portable hothouses laid out on New Year\\u2019s morning beneath the lighted lamp \\u2014 for the children were always too impatient to wait for daylight \\u2014 among all the other New Year\\u2019s presents but the loveliest of them all, consoling them with its real plants which they could tend as they grew for the bareness of the winter soil; and even more than those little houses themselves, those winter-gardens were like the hothouse that the children could see there at the same time, portrayed in a delightful book, another of their presents, and one which, for all that it was given not to them but to Mlle. Lili, the heroine of the story, enchanted them to such a pitch that even now, when they are almost old men and women, they ask themselves whether, in those fortunate years, winter was not the loveliest of the seasons. And inside there, beyond the winter-garden, through the various kinds of arborescence which from the street made the lighted window appear like the glass front of one of those children\\u2019s playthings, pictured or real, the passer-by, drawing himself up on tiptoe, would generally observe a man in a frock coat, a gardenia or a carnation in his buttonhole, standing before a seated lady, both vaguely outlined, like two intaglios cut in a topaz, in the depths of the drawing-room atmosphere clouted by the samovar \\u2014 then a recent importation \\u2014 with steam which may very possibly be escaping from it still to-day, but to which, if it does, we are grown so accustomed now that no one notices it. Mme. Swann attached great importance to her \\u2018tea\\u2019; she thought that she shewed her originality and e pressed her charm when she said to a man, \\u201cYou will find me at home any day, fairly late; come to tea!\\u201d so that she allowed a sweet and delicate smile to accompany the words which she pronounced with a fleeting trace of English accent, and which her listener duly noted, bowing solemnly in acceptance, as though the invitation had been something important and uncommon which commanded deference and required attention. There was another reason, apart from those given already, for the flowers\\u2019 having more than a merely ornamental part in Mme. Swann\\u2019s drawing-room, and this reason pertained not to the period, but, in some degree, to the former life of Odette. A great courtesan, such as she had been, lives largely for her lovers, that is to say at home, which means that she comes in time to live for her home. The things that one sees in the house of a \\u2018respectable\\u2019 woman, things which may of course appear to her also to be of importance, are those which are in any event of the utmost importance to the courtesan. The culminating point of her day is not the moment in which she dresses herself for all the world to see, but that in which she undresses herself for a man. She must be as smart in her wrapper, in her nightgown, as in her outdoor attire. Other women display their jewels, but as for her, she lives in the intimacy of her pearls. This kind of e istence imposes on her as an obligation and ends by giving her a fondness for lu ury which is secret, that is to say which comes near to being disinterested. Mme. Swann e tended this to include her flowers. There was always beside her chair an immense bowl of crystal filled to the brim with Parma violets or with long white daisy-petals scattered upon the water, which seemed to be testifying, in the eyes of the arriving guest, to some favourite and interrupted occupation, such as the cup of tea which Mme. Swann would, for her own amusement, have been drinking there by herself; an occupation more intimate still and more mysterious, so much so that one felt oneself impelled to apologise on seeing the flowers e posed there by her side, as one would have apologised for looking at the title of the still open book which would have revealed to one what had just been read by \\u2014 and so, perhaps, what was still in the mind of Odette. And unlike the book the flowers were living things; it was annoying, when one entered the room to pay Mme. Swann a visit, to discover that she was not alone, or if one came home with her not to find the room empty, so prominent a place in it, enigmatic and intimately associated with hours in the life of their mistress of which one knew nothing, did those flowers assume which had not been made ready for Odette\\u2019s visitors but, as it were, forgotten there by her, had held and would hold with her again private conversations which one was afraid of disturbing, the secret of which one tried in vain to read, fastening one\\u2019s eyes on the moist purple, the still liquid water-colour of the Parma violets. By the end of October Odette would begin to come home with the utmost punctuality for tea, which was still known, at that time, as \\u2018five-o\\u2019clock tea,\\u2019 having once heard it said, and being fond of repeating that if Mme. Verdurin had been able to form a salon it was because people were always certain of finding her at home at the same hour. She imagined that she herself had one also, of the same kind, but freer, senza rigore as she used to say. She saw herself figuring thus as a sort of Lespinasse, and believed that she had founded a rival salon by taking from the du Defiant of the little group several of her most attractive men, notably Swann himself, who had followed her in her secession and into her retirement, according-to a version for which one can understand that she had succeeded in gaining credit among her more recent friends, ignorant of what had passed, though without convincing herself. But certain favourite parts are played by us so often before the public and rehearsed so carefully when we are alone that we find it easier to refer to their fictitious testimony than to that of a reality which we have almost entirely forgotten. On days on which Mme. Swann had not left the house, one found her in a wrapper of cr\\u00eape-de-Chine, white as the first snows of winter, or, it might be, in one of those long pleated garments of moussettne-de-soie, which seemed nothing more than a shower of white or rosy petals, and would be regarded to-day as hardly suitable for winter, though quite wrongly. For these light fabrics and soft colours gave to a woman \\u2014 in the stifling warmth of the drawing-rooms of those days, with their heavily curtained doors, rooms of which the most effective thing that the society novelists of the time could find to say was that they were \\u2018e quisitely cushioned\\u2019\\u2014 the same air of coolness that they gave to the roses which were able to stay in the room there by her side, despite the winter, in the glowing flesh tints of their nudity, as though it were already spring. By reason of the muffling of all sound in the carpets, and of the remoteness of her cosy retreat, the lady of the house, not being apprised of your entry as she is to-day, would continue to read almost until you were standing before her chair, which enhanced still further that sense of the romantic, that charm of a sort of secret discovery, which we find to-day in the memory of those gowns, already out of fashion even then, which Mme. Swann was perhaps alone in not having discarded, and which give us the feeling that the woman who wore them must have been the heroine of a novel because most of us have scarcely set eyes on them outside the pages of certain of Henry Gr\\u00e9ville\\u2019s tales. Odette had, at this time, in her drawing-room, when winter began, chrysanthemums of enormous size and a variety of colours such as Swann, in the old days, certainly never saw in her drawing-room in the Rue La P\\u00e9rouse. My admiration for them \\u2014 when I went to pay Mme. Swann one of those melancholy visits during which, prompted by my sorrow, I discovered in her all the mystical poetry of her character as the mother of that Gilberte to whom she would say on the morrow: \\u201cYour friend came to see me yesterday,\\u201d\\u2014 sprang, no doubt, from my sense that, rose-pale like the Louis XIV silk that covered her chairs, snow-white like her cr\\u00eape-de-Chine wrapper, or of a metallic red like her samovar, they superimposed upon the decoration of the room another, a supplementary scheme of decoration, as rich, as delicate in its colouring, but one which was alive and would last for a few days only. But I was touched to find that these chrysanthemums appeared less ephemeral than, one might almost say, lasting, when I compared them with the tones, as pink, as coppery, which the setting sun so gorgeously displays amid the mists of a November afternoon, and which, after seeing them, before I had entered the house, fade from the sky, I found again inside, prolonged, transposed on to the flaming palette of the flowers. Like the fires caught and fi ed by a great colourist from the impermanence of the atmosphere and the sun, so that they should enter and adorn a human dwelling, they invited me, those chrysanthemums, to put away all my sorrows and to taste with a greedy rapture during that \\u2018tea-time\\u2019 the too fleeting joys of November, of which they set ablaze all around me the intimate and mystical glory. Alas, it was not in the conversations to which I must listen that I could hope to attain to that glory; they had but little in common with it. Even with Mme. Cottard, and although it was growing late, Mme. Swann would assume her most caressing manner to say: \\u201cOh, no, it\\u2019s not late, really; you mustn\\u2019t look at the clock; that\\u2019s not the right time; it\\u2019s stopped; you can\\u2019t possibly have anything else to do now, why be in such a hurry?\\u201d as she pressed a final tartlet upon the Professor\\u2019s wife, who was gripping her card-case in readiness for flight  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cOne simply can\\u2019t tear oneself away from this house!\\u201d observed Mme. Bontemps to Mme. Swann, while Mme. Cottard, in her astonishment at hearing her own thought put into words, e claimed: \\u201cWhy, that\\u2019s just what I always say myself, what I tell my own little judge, in the court of conscience!\\u201d winning the applause of the gentlemen from the Jockey Club, who had been profuse in their salutations, as though confounded at such an honour\\u2019s being done them, when Mme. Swann had  duced them to this common and by no means attractive little woman, who kept herself, when confronted with Odette\\u2019s brilliant friends, in reserve, if not on what she herself called \\u2018the defensive,\\u2019 for she always used stately language to describe the simplest happenings. \\u201cI should never have suspected it,\\u201d was Mme. Swann\\u2019s comment, \\u201cthree Wednesdays running you\\u2019ve played me false.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s quite true, Odette; it\\u2019s simply ages, it\\u2019s an eternity since I saw you last. You see, I plead guilty; but I must tell you,\\u201d she went on with a vague suggestion of outraged modesty, for although a doctor\\u2019s wife she would never have dared to speak without periphrasis of rheumatism or of a chill on the kidneys,\\u201d that I have had a lot of little troubles. As we all have, I dare say. And besides that I\\u2019ve had a crisis among my masculine domestics. I\\u2019m sure, I\\u2019m no more imbued with a sense of my own authority than most ladies; still I\\u2019ve been obliged, just to make an e ample you know, to give my Vatel notice; I believe he was looking out anyhow for a more remunerative place. But his departure nearly brought about the resignation of my entire ministry. My own maid refused to stay in the house a moment longer; oh, we have had some Homeric scenes. However I held fast to the reins through thick and thin; the whole affair\\u2019s been a perfect lesson, which won\\u2019t be lost on me, I can tell you. I\\u2019m afraid I\\u2019m boring you with all these stories about servants, but you know as well as I do what a business it is when one is obliged to set about rearranging one\\u2019s household  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cAren\\u2019t we to see anything of your delicious child?\\u201d she wound up. \\u201cNo, my delicious child is dining with a friend,\\u201d replied Mme. Swann, and then, turning to me: \\u201cI believe she\\u2019s written to you, asking you to come and see her to-morrow. And your babies?\\u201d she went on to Mme. Cottard. I breathed a sigh of relief. These words by which Mme. Swann proved to me that I oould see Gilberte whenever I chose gave me precisely the comfort which I had come to seek, and which at that time made my visits to Mme. Swann so necessary. \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m afraid not; I shall write to her, anyhow, this evening. Gilberte and I never seem to see one another now,\\u201d I added, pretending to attribute our separation to some mysterious agency, which gave me a further illusion of being in love, supported as well by the affectionate way in which I spoke of Gilberte and she of me. \\u201cYou know, she\\u2019s simply devoted to you,\\u201d said Mme. Swann. \\u201cReally, you won\\u2019t come to-morrow?\\u201d Suddenly my heart rose on wings; the thought had just struck me \\u2014\\u201cAfter all, why shouldn\\u2019t I, since it\\u2019s her own mother who suggests it?\\u201d But with the thought I fell back into my old depression. I was afraid now lest, when she saw me again, Gilberte might think that my indifference of late had been feigned, and it seemed wiser to prolong our separation. During these asides Mme. Bontemps had been complaining of the insufferable dulness of politicians\\u2019 wives, for she pretended to find everyone too deadly or too stupid for words, and to deplore her husband\\u2019s official position. \\u201cDo you mean to say you can shake hands with fifty doctors\\u2019 wives, like that, one after the other?\\u201d she e claimed to Mme. Cottard, who, unlike her, was full of the kindest feelings for everybody and of determination to do her duty in every respect. \\u201cAh! you\\u2019re a law-abiding woman! You see, in my case\\u2019, at the Ministry, don\\u2019t you know, I simply have to keep it up, of course. It\\u2019s too much for me, I can tell you; you know what those officials\\u2019 wives are like, it\\u2019s all I can do not to put my tongue out at them. And my niece Albertine is just like me. You really wouldn\\u2019t believe the impudence that girl has. Last week, on my \\u2018day,\\u2019 I had the wife of the Under Secretary of State for Finance, who told us that she knew nothing at all about cooking. \\u2018But surely, ma\\u2019am,\\u2019 my niece chipped in with her most winning smile, \\u2018you ought to know everything about it, after all the dishes your father had to wash.\\u2019\\u201d \\u201cOh, I do love that story; I think it\\u2019s simply e quisite!\\u201d cried Mme. Swann. \\u201cBut certainly on the Doctor\\u2019s consultation days you should make a point of being \\u2018at home,\\u2019 among your flowers and books and all your pretty things,\\u201d she urged Mme. Cottard. \\u201cStraight out like that! Bang! Right in the face; bang! She made no bones about it, I can tell you! And she\\u2019d never said a word to me about it, the little wretch; she\\u2019s as cunning as a monkey. You are lucky to be able to control yourself; I do envy people who can hide what is in their minds.\\u201d \\u201cBut I\\u2019ve no need to do that, Mme. Bontemps, I\\u2019m not so hard to please,\\u201d Mme. Cottard gently e postulated. \\u201cFor one thing, I\\u2019m not in such a privileged position,\\u201d she went on, slightly raising her voice as was her custom, as though she were underlining the point of her remark, whenever she slipped into the conversation any of those delicate courtesies, those skilful flatteries which won her the admiration and assisted the career of her husband. \\u201cAnd besides I\\u2019m only too glad to do anything that can be of use to the Professor.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cBut, my dear, it isn\\u2019t what one\\u2019s glad to do; it\\u2019s what one is able to do! I e pect you\\u2019re not nervous. Do you know, whenever I see the War Minister\\u2019s wife making faces, I start copying her at once. It\\u2019s a dreadful thing to have a temperament like mine.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cTo be sure, yes,\\u201d said Mme. Cottard, \\u201cI\\u2019ve heard people say that she had a twitch; my husband knows someone else who occupies a very high position, and it\\u2019s only natural, when gentlemen get talking together . . . \\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cAnd then, don\\u2019t you know, it\\u2019s just the same with the Chief of the Registry; he\\u2019s a hunchback. Whenever he comes to see me, before he\\u2019s been in the room five minutes my fingers are itching to stroke his hump. My husband says I\\u2019ll cost him his place. What if I do! A fig for the Ministry! Yes, a fig for the Ministry! I should like to have that printed as a motto on my notepaper. I can see I am shocking you; you\\u2019re so frightfully proper, but I must say there\\u2019s nothing amuses me like a little devilry now and then. Life would be dreadfully monotonous without it.\\u201d And she went on talking about the Ministry all the time, as though it had been Mount Olympus. To change the conversation, Mme. Swann turned to Mme. Cottard: \\u201cBut you\\u2019re looking very smart to-day. Redfern fecit?\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cNo, you know, I always swear by Rauthnitz. Besides, it\\u2019s only an old thing I\\u2019ve had done up.\\u201d \\u201cNot really! It\\u2019s charming!\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cGuess how much. . . . No, change the first figure!\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 \\u201cYou don\\u2019t say so! Why, that\\u2019s nothing; it\\u2019s given away! Three times that at least, I should have said.\\u201d \\u201cYou see how history comes to be written,\\u201d apostrophised the doctor\\u2019s wife. And pointing to a neck-ribbon which had been a present from Mme. Swann: \\u201cLook, Odette! Do you recognise this?\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Through the gap between a pair of curtains a head peeped with ceremonious deference, making a playful pretence of being afraid of disturbing the party; it was Swann. \\u201cOdette, the Prince d\\u2019Agrigente is with me in the study. He wants to know if he may pay his respects to you. What am I to tell him?\\u201d \\u201cWhy, that I shall be delighted,\\u201d Odette would reply, secretly flattered, but without losing anything of the composure which came to her all the more easily since she had always, even in her \\u2018fast\\u2019 days, been accustomed to entertain men of fashion. Swann disappeared to deliver the message, and would presently return with the Prince, unless in the meantime Mme. Verdurin had arrived. When he married Odette Swann had insisted on her ceasing to frequent the little clan. He had several good reasons for this stipulation, though, had he had none, he would have made it just the same in obedience to a law of ingratitude which admits no e ception, and proves that every \\u2018go-between\\u2019 is either lacking in foresight or else singularly disinterested. He had conceded only that Odette and Mme. Verdurin might e change visits once a year, and even this seemed e cessive to some of the \\u2018faithful,\\u2019 indignant at the insult offered to the \\u2018Mistress\\u2019 who for so many years had treated Odette and even Swann himself as the spoiled children of her house. For if it contained false brethren who \\u2018failed\\u2019 upon certain evenings in order that they might secretly accept an invitation from Odette, ready, in the event of discovery, with the e cuse that they were an ious to meet Bergotte although the Mistress assured them that he never went to the Swanns\\u2019, and even if he did, had no vestige of talent, really \\u2014 in spite of which she was making the most strenuous efforts, to quote one of her favourite e pressions, to \\u2018attract\\u2019 him, the little group had its \\u2018die-hards\\u2019 also. And these, though ignorant of those conventional refinements which often dissuade people from the e treme attitude one would have liked to see them adopt in order to annoy some one else, would have wished Mme. Verdurin, but had never managed to prevail upon her, to sever all connection with Odette, and thus deprive Odette of the satisfaction of saying, with a mocking laugh: \\u201cWe go to the Mistress\\u2019s very seldom now, since the Schism. It was all very well while my husband was still a bachelor, but when one is married, you know, it isn\\u2019t always so easy. . . . If you must know, M. Swann can\\u2019t abide old Ma Verdurin, and he wouldn\\u2019t much like the idea of my going there regularly, as I used to. And I, as a dutiful spouse, don\\u2019t you see . . .?\\u201d Swann would accompany his wife to their annual evening there but would take care not to be in the room when Mme. Verdurin came to call. And so, if the \\u2018Mistress\\u2019 was in the drawing-room, the Prince d\\u2019Agrigente would enter it alone. Alone, too, he was presented to her by Odette, who preferred that Mme. Verdurin should be left in ignorance of the names of her humbler guests, and so might, seeing more than one strange face in the room, be led to believe that she was mi ing with the cream of the aristocracy, a device which proved so far successful that Mme. Verdurin said to her husband, that evening, with profound contempt: \\u201cCharming people, her friends! I met all the fine flower of the Reaction!\\u201d Odette was living, with respect to Mme. Verdurin, under a con illusion. Not that the latter\\u2019s salon had ever begun, at that time, to develop into what we shail one day see it to have become. Mme. Verdurin had not yet reached the period of incubation in which one dispenses with one\\u2019s big parties, where the few brilliant specimens recently acquired would be lost in too numerous a crowd, and prefers to wait until the generative force of the ten righteous whom one has succeeded in attracting shall have multiplied those ten seventyfold. As Odette was not to be long now in doing, Mme. Verdurin did indeed entertain the idea of \\u2018Society\\u2019 as her final objective, but her zone of attack was as yet so restricted, and moreover so remote from that in which Odette had some chance of arriving at an identical goal, of breaking the line of defence, that the latter remained absolutely ignorant of the strategic plans which the \\u2018Mistress\\u2019 was elaborating. And it was with the most perfect sincerity that Odette, when anyone spoke to her of Mme. Verdurin as a snob, would answer, laughing, \\u201cOh, no, quite the opposite! For one thing, she never gets a chance of being a snob; she doesn\\u2019t know anyone. And then, to do her justice, I must say that she seems quite pleased not to know anyone. No, what she likes are her Wednesdays, and people who talk well.\\u201d And in her heart of hearts she envied Mme. Verdurin for all that she did not despair of having herself, in so eminent a school, succeeded in acquiring them those arts to which the \\u2018Mistress\\u2019 attached such paramount importance, albeit they did but discriminate, between shades of the Non-e istent, sculpture the void, and were, properly speaking, the Arts of Nonentity: to wit those, in the lady of a house, of knowing how to \\u2018bring people together,\\u2019 how to \\u2018group,\\u2019 to \\u2018draw out,\\u2019 to \\u2018keep in the background,\\u2019 to act as a \\u2018connecting link.\\u2019  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 In any case, Mme. Swann\\u2019s friends were impressed when they saw in her house a lady of whom they were accustomed to think only as in her own, in an inseparable setting of her guests, amid the whole of her little group which they were astonished to behold thus suggested, summarised, assembled, packed into a single armchair in the bodily form of the \\u2018Mistress,\\u2019 the hostess turned visitor, muffled in her cloak with its grebe trimming, as shaggy as the white skins that carpeted that drawing-room embowered in which Mme. Verdurin was a drawing-room in herself. The more timid among the women thought it prudent to retire, and using the plural, as people do when they mean to hint to the rest of the room that it is wiser not to tire a convalescent who is out of bed for the first time: \\u201cOdette,\\u201d they murmured, \\u201cwe are going to leave you.\\u201d They envied Mme. Cottard, whom the \\u2018Mistress\\u2019 called by her Christian name. \\u201cCan I drop you anywhere?\\u201d Mme. Verdurin asked her, unable to bear the thought that one of the faithful was going to remain behind instead of following her from the room. \\u201cOh, but this lady has been so very kind as to say, she\\u2019ll take me,\\u201d replied Mme. Cottard, not wishing to appear to be forgetting, when approached by a more illustrious personage, that she had accepted the offer which Mme. Bont\\u00e9mps had made of driving her home behind her cockaded coachman. \\u201cI must say that I am always specially grateful to the friends who are so kind as to take me with them in their vehicles. It is a regular godsend to me, who have no Automedon.\\u201d \\u201cEspecially,\\u201d broke in the \\u2018Mistress,\\u2019 who felt that she must say something, since she knew Mme. Bont\\u00e9mps slightly and had just invited her to her Wednesdays, \\u201cas at Mme. de Cr\\u00e9cy\\u2019s house you\\u2019re not very near home. Oh, good gracious, I shall never get into the way of saying Mme. Swann!\\u201d It was a recognised pleasantry in the little clan, among those who were not overendowed with wit, to pretend that they could never grow used to saying \\u2018Mme. Swann.\\u2019 \\u201cI have been so accustomed to saying Mme. de Cr\\u00e9cy that I nearly went wrong again!\\u201d Only Mme. Verdurin, when she spoke to Odette, was not content with the nearly, but went wrong on purpose. \\u201cDon\\u2019t you feel afraid, Odette, living out in the wilds like this? I\\u2019m sure I shouldn\\u2019t feel at all comfortable, coming home after dark. Besides, it\\u2019s so damp. It can\\u2019t be at all good for your husband\\u2019s eczema. You haven\\u2019t rats in the house, I hope!\\u201d \\u201cOh, dear no. What a horrid idea!\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s a good thing; I was told you had. I\\u2019m glad to know it\\u2019s not true, because I have a perfect horror of the creatures, and I should never have come to see you again. Goodbye, my dear child, we shall meet again soon; you know what a pleasure it is to me to see you. You don\\u2019t know how to put your chrysanthemums in water,\\u201d she went on, as she prepared to leave the room, Mme. Swann having risen to escort her. \\u201cThey are Japanese flowers; you must arrange them the same way as the Japanese.\\u201d \\u201cI do not agree with Mme. Verdurin, although she is the Law and the Prophets to me in all things! There\\u2019s no one like you, Odette, for finding such lovely chrysanthemums, or chrysanthema rather, for it seems that\\u2019s what we ought to call them now,\\u201d declared Mme. Cottard as soon as the \\u2018Mistress\\u2019 had shut the door behind her. \\u201cDear Mme. Verdurin is not always very kind about other people\\u2019s flowers,\\u201d said Odette sweetly. \\u201cWhom do you go to, Odette,\\u201d asked Mme. Cottard, to forestall any further criticism of the \\u2018Mistress.\\u2019 \\u201cLema\\u00eetre? I must confess, the other day in Lema\\u00eetre\\u2019s window I saw a huge, great pink bush which made me do something quite mad.\\u201d But modesty forbade her to give any more precise details as to the price of the bush, and she said merely that the Professor, \\u201cand you know, he\\u2019s not at all a quicktempered man,\\u201d had \\u2018waved his sword in the air\\u2019 and told her that she \\u201cdidn\\u2019t know what money meant.\\u201d \\u201cNo, no, I\\u2019ve no regular florist e cept Debac.\\u201d \\u201cNor have I,\\u201d said Mme. Cottard, \\u201cbut I confess that I am unfaithful to him now and then with Lachaume.\\u201d \\u201cOh, you forsake him for Lachaume, do you; I must tell Debac that,\\u201d retorted Odette, always an ious to shew her wit, and to lead the conversation in her own house, where she felt more at her ease than in the little clan. \\u201cBesides, Lachaume is really becoming too dear; his prices are quite e cessive, don\\u2019t you know; I find his prices impossible!\\u201d she added, laughing  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Meanwhile Mme. Bontemps, who had been heard a hundred times to declare that nothing would induce her to go to the Verdurins\\u2019, delighted at being asked to the famous Wednesdays, was planning in her own mind how she could manage to attend as many of them as possible. She was not\\u2019 aware that Mme. Verdurin liked people not to miss a single one; also she was one of those people whose company is but little sought, who, when a hostess invites them to a series of parties, do not accept and go to them without more ado, like those who know that it is always a pleasure to see them, whenever they have a moment to spare and feel inclined to go out; people of her type deny themselves it may be the first evening and the third, imagining that their absence will be noticed, and save themselves up for the second and fourth, unless it should happen that, having heard from a trustworthy source that the third is to be a particularly brilliant party, they re the original order, assuring their hostess that \\u201cmost unfortunately, we had another engagement last week.\\u201d So Mme. Bontemps was calculating how many Wednesdays there could still be left before Easter, and by what means she might manage to secure one e tra, and yet not appear to be thrusting herself upon her hostess. She relied upon Mme. Cottard, whom she would have with her in the carriage going home, to give her a few hints. \\u201cOh, Mme. Bontemps, I see you getting up to go; it is very bad of you to give the signal for flight like that! You owe me some compensation for not turning up last Thursday. . . . Come, sit down again, just for a minute. You can\\u2019t possibly be going anywhere else before dinner. Really, you won\\u2019t let yourself be tempted?\\u201d went on Mme. Swann, and, as she held out a plate of cakes, \\u201cYou know, they\\u2019re not at all bad, these little horrors. They don\\u2019t look nice, but just taste one, I know you\\u2019ll like it.\\u201d \\u201cOn the contrary, they look quite delicious,\\u201d broke in Mme. Cottard. \\u201cIn your house, Odette, one is never short of victuals. I have no need to ask to see the trade-mark; I know you get everything from Rebattet. I must say that I am more eclectic. For sweet biscuits and everything of that sort I repair, as often as not, to Bourbonneu . But I agree that they simply don\\u2019t know what an ice means. Rebattet for everything iced, and syrups and sorbets; they\\u2019re past masters. As my husband would say, they\\u2019re the ne plus ultra.\\u201d \\u201cOh, but we just make these in the house. You won\\u2019t, really?\\u201d \\u201cI shan\\u2019t be able to eat a scrap of dinner,\\u201d pleaded Mme. Bontemps, \\u201cbut I will just sit down again for a moment; you know, I adore talking to a clever woman like you.\\u201d \\u201cYou will think me highly indiscreet, Odette, but I should so like to know what you thought of the hat Mme. Trombert had on. I know, of course, that big hats are the fashion just now. All the same, wasn\\u2019t it just the least little bit e aggerated? And compared to the hat she came to see me in the other day, the one she had on just now was microscopic!\\u201d \\u201cOh no, I am not at all clever,\\u201d said Odette, thinking that this sounded well. \\u201cI am a perfect simpleton, I believe everything people say, and worry myself to death over the least thing.\\u201d And she insinuated that she had, just at first, suffered terribly from the thought of having married a man like Swann, who had a separate life of his own and was unfaithful to her. Meanwhile the Prince d\\u2019Agrigente, having caught the words \\u201cI am not at all clever,\\u201d thought it incumbent on him to protest; unfortunately he had not the knack of repartee. \\u201cTut, tut, tut, tut!\\u201d cried Mme. Bontemps, \\u201cNot clever; you!\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s just what I was saying to myself \\u2014\\u2018What do I hear?\\u2019,\\u201d the Prince clutched at this straw, \\u201cMy ears must have played me false!\\u201d \\u201cNo, I assure you,\\u201d went on Odette, \\u201cI am really just an ordinary woman, very easily shocked, full of prejudices, living in my own little groove and dreadfully ignorant.\\u201d And then, in case he had any news of the Baron de Charlus, \\u201cHave you seen our dear Baronet?\\u201d she asked him. \\u201cYou, ignorant!\\u201d cried Mme. Bontemps. \\u201cThen I wonder what you\\u2019d say of the official world, all those wives of E cellencies who can talk of nothing but their frocks. . . . Listen to this, my friend; not more than a week ago I happened to mention Lohengrin to the Education Minister\\u2019s wife. She stared at me, and said \\u2018Lohengrin? Oh, yes, the new review at the Folies-Berg\\u00e8res. I hear it\\u2019s a perfect scream!\\u2019 What do you say to that, eh? You can\\u2019t help yourself; when people say things like that it makes your blood boil. I could have struck her. Because I have a bit of a temper of my own. What do you say, sir;\\u201d she turned to me, \\u201cwas I not right?\\u201d \\u201cListen,\\u201d said Mme. Cottard, \\u201cpeople can\\u2019t help answering a little off the mark when they\\u2019re asked a thing like that point blank, without any warning. I know something about it, because Mme. Verdurin also has a habit of putting a pistol to your head.\\u201d \\u201cSpeaking of Mme. Verdurin,\\u201d Mme. Bontemps asked Mme. Cottard, \\u201cdo you know who will be there on Wednesday? Oh, I\\u2019ve just remembered that we\\u2019ve accepted an invitation for ne t Wednesday. You wouldn\\u2019t care to dine with us on Wednesday week? We could go on together to Mme. Verdurin\\u2019s. I should never dare to go there by myself; I don\\u2019t know why it is, that great lady always terrifies me.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019ll tell you what it is,\\u201d replied Mme. Cottard, \\u201cwhat frightens you about Mme. Verdurin is her organ. But you see everyone can\\u2019t have such a charming organ as Mme. Swann. Once you\\u2019ve found your tongue, as the \\u2018Mistress\\u2019 says, the ice will soon be broken. For she\\u2019s a very easy person, really, to get on with. But I can quite understand what you feel; it\\u2019s never pleasant to find oneself for the first time in a strange country.\\u201d \\u201cWon\\u2019t you dine with us, too?\\u201d said Mme. Bontemps to Mme. Swann. \\u201cAfter dinner we could all go to the Verdurins\\u2019 together, \\u2018do a Verdurin\\u2019; and even if it means that the \\u2018Mistress\\u2019 will stare me out of countenance and never ask me to the house again, once we are there we\\u2019ll just sit by ourselves and have a quiet talk, I\\u2019m sure that\\u2019s what I should like best.\\u201d But this assertion can hardly have been quite truthful, for Mme. Bontemps went on to ask: \\u201cWho do you think will be there on Wednesday week? What will they be doing? There won\\u2019t be too big a crowd, I hope!\\u201d \\u201cI certainly shan\\u2019t be there,\\u201d said Odette. \\u201cWe shall just look in for a minute on the last Wednesday of all. If you don\\u2019t mind waiting till then \\u2014\\u2014\\u201d But Mme. Bontemps did not appear to be tempted by the proposal  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Granted that the intellectual distinction of a house and its smartness are generally in in rather than direct ratio, one must suppose, since Swann found Mme. Bontemps attractive, that any forfeiture of position once accepted has the consequence of making us less particular with regard to the people among whom we have resigned ourselves to finding entertainment, less particular with regard to their intelligence as to everything else about them. And if this be true, men, like nations, must see their culture and even their language disappear with their independence. One of the effects of this indulgence is to aggravate the tendency which after a certain age we have towards finding pleasure in speeches that are a homage to our own turn of mind, to our weaknesses, an encouragement to us to yield to them; that is the age at which a great artist prefers to the company of original minds that of pupils who have nothing in common with him save the letter of his doctrine, who listen to him and offer incense; at which a man or woman of mark, who is living entirely for love, will find that the most intelligent person in a gathering is one perhaps of no distinction, but one who has shewn by some utterance that he can understand and approve what is meant by an e istence devoted to gallantry, and has thus pleasantly e cited the voluptuous instincts of the lover or mistress; it was the age, too, at which Swann, in so far as he had become the husband of Odette, enjoyed hearing Mme. Bontemps say how silly it was to have nobody in one\\u2019s house but duchesses concluding from that, quite the contrary of what he would have decided in the old days at the Verdurins\\u2019, that she was a good creature, e tremely sensible and not at all a snob and telling her stories which made her \\u2018die laughing\\u2019 because she had not heard them before, although she always \\u2018saw the point\\u2019 at once, liked flattering her for his own amusement. \\u201cThen the Doctor is not mad about flowers, like you?\\u201d Mme. Swann asked Mme. Cottard. \\u201cOh, well, you know, my husband is a sage; be practises moderation in all things. Yet, I must admit, he has a passion.\\u201d Her eye aflame with malice, joy, curiosity, \\u201cAnd what is that, pray?\\u201d inquired Mme. Bontemps. Quite simply Mme. Cottard answered her, \\u201cReading.\\u201d \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s a very restful passion in a husband!\\u201d cried Mme. Bontemps suppressing an impish laugh. \\u201cWhen the Doctor gets a book in his hands, you know!\\u201d \\u201cWell, that needn\\u2019t alarm you much . . . \\u201d \\u201cBut it does, for his eyesight. I must go now and look after him, Odette, and I shall come back on the very first opportunity and knock at your door. Talking of eyesight, have you heard that the new house Mme. Verdurin has just bought is to be lighted by electricity? I didn\\u2019t get that from my own little secret service, you know, but from quite a different source; it was the electrician himself, Mild\\u00e9, who told me. You see, I quote my authorities! Even the bedrooms, he says, are to have electric lamps with shades which will filter the light. It is evidently a charming lu ury, for those who can afford it. But it seems that our contemporaries must absolutely have the newest thing if it\\u2019s the only one of its kind in the world. Just fancy, the sister-in-law of a friend of mine has had the telephone installed in her house! She can order things from her tradesmen without having to go out of doors! I confess that I\\u2019ve made the most bare-faced stratagems to get permission to go there one day, just to speak into the instrument. It\\u2019s very tempting, but more in a friend\\u2019s house than at home. I don\\u2019t think I should like to have the telephone in my establishment. Once the first e citement is over, it must be a perfect racket going on all the time. Now, Odette, I must be off; you\\u2019re not to keep Mme. Bontemps any longer, she\\u2019s looking after me. I must absolutely tear myself away; you\\u2019re making me behave in a nice way, I shall be getting home after my husband!\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 And for myself also it was time to return home, before I had tasted those wintry delights of which the chrysanthemums had seemed to me to be the brilliant envelope. These pleasures had not appeared, and yet Mme. Swann did not look as though she e pected anything more. She allowed the servants to carry away the tea-things, as who should say \\u201cTime, please, gentlemen!\\u201d And at last she did say to me: \\u201cReally, must you go? Very well; good-bye!\\u201d I felt that I might have stayed there without encountering those unknown pleasures, and that my unhappiness was not the cause of my having to forego them. Were they to be found, then, situated not upon that beaten track of hours which leads one always to the moment of departure, but rather upon some cross-road unknown to me along which I ought to have digressed? At least, the object of my visit had been attained; Gilberte would know that I had come to see her parents when she was not at home, and that I had, as Mme. Cottard had incessantly assured me, \\u201cmade a complete conquest, first shot, of Mme. Verdurin,\\u201d whom, she added, she had never seen \\u2018make so much\\u2019 of anyone. \\u201cYou and she must have hooked atoms.\\u201d She would know that I had spoken of her as was fitting, with affection, but that I had not that incapacity for living without our seeing one another which I believed to be at the root of the boredom that she had shewn at our last meetings. I had told Mme. Swann that I should not be able to see Gilberte again. I had said this as though I had finally decided not to see her any more. And the letter which I was going to send Gilberte would be framed on those lines. Only to myself, to fortify my courage, I proposed no more than a supreme and concentrated effort, lasting a few days only. I said to myself: \\u201cThis is the last time that I shall refuse to meet her; I shall accept the ne t invitation.\\u201d To make our separation less difficult to realise, I did not picture it to myself as final. But I knew very well that it would be  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 The first of January was e ceptionally painful to me that winter. So, no doubt, is everything that marks a date and an anniversary when we are unhappy. But if our unhappiness is due to the loss of some dear friend, our suffering consists merely in an unusually vivid comparison of the present with the past. There was added to this, in my case, the une pressed hope that Gilberte, having intended to leave me to take the first steps towards a reconciliation, and discovering that I had not taken them, had been waiting only for the e cuse of New Year\\u2019s Day to write to me, saying: \\u201cWhat is the matter? I am madly in love with you; come, and let us e plain things properly; I cannot live without seeing you.\\u201d As the last days of the old year went by, such a letter began to seem probable. It was, perhaps, nothing of the sort, but to make us believe that such a thing is probable the desire, the need that we have for it suffices. The soldier is convinced that a certain interval of time, capable of being indefinitely prolonged, will be allowed him before the bullet finds him, the thief before he is taken, men in general before they have to die. That is the amulet which preserves people \\u2014 and sometimes peoples \\u2014 not from danger but from the fear of danger, in reality from the belief in danger, which in certain cases allows them to brave it without their actually needing to be brave. It is confidence of this sort, and with as little foundation, that sustains the lover who is counting upon a reconciliation, upon a letter. For me to cease to e pect a letter it would have sufficed that I should have ceased to wish for one. However unimportant one may know that one is in the eyes of her whom one still loves, one attributes to her a series of thoughts though their sum-total be indifference the intention to e press those thoughts, a complication of her inner life in which one is the constant object possibly of her antipathy but certainly of her attention. But to imagine what was going on in Gilberte\\u2019s mind I should have required simply the power to anticipate on that New Year\\u2019s Day what I should feel on the first day of any of the years to come, when the attention or the silence or the affection or the coldness of Gilberte would pass almost unnoticed by me and I should not dream, should not even be able to dream of seeking a solution of problems which would have ceased to perple  me. When we are in love, our love is too big a thing for us to be able altogether to contain it within us. It radiates towards the beloved object, finds in her a surface which arrests it, forcing it to return to its starting-point, and it is this shock of the repercussion of our own affection which we call the other\\u2019s regard for ourselves, and which pleases us more then than on its outward journey because we do not recognise it as having originated in ourselves. New Year\\u2019s Day rang out all its hours without there coming to me that letter from Gilberte. And as I received a few others containing greetings tardy or retarded by the overburdening of the mails at that season, on the third and fourth of January I hoped still, but my hope grew hourly more faint. Upon the days that followed I gazed through a mist of tears. This undoubtedly meant that, having been less sincere than I thought in my renunciation of Gilberte, I had kept the hope of a letter from her for the New Year. And seeing that hope e hausted before I had had time to shelter myself behind another, I suffered as would an invalid who had emptied his phial of morphia without having another within his reach. But perhaps also in my case \\u2014 and these two e planations are not mutually e clusive, for a single feeling is often made up of contrary elements \\u2014 the hope that I entertained of ultimately receiving a letter had brought to my mind\\u2019s eye once again the image of Gilberte, had reawakened the emotions which the e pectation of finding myself in her presence, the sight of her, her way of treating me had aroused in me before. The immediate possibility of a reconciliation had suppressed in me that faculty the immense importance of which we are apt to overlook: the faculty of resignation. Neurasthenics find it impossible to believe the friends who assure them that they will gradually recover their peace of mind if they will stay in bed and receive no letters, read no newspapers. They imagine that such a course will only e asperate their twitching nerves. And similarly lovers, who look upon it from their enclosure in a contrary state of mind, who have not begun yet to make trial of it, are unable to believe in the healing power of renunciation  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 In consequence of the violence of my palpitations, my doses of caffeine were reduced; the palpitations ceased. Whereupon I asked myself whether it was not to some e tent the drug that had been responsible for the anguish that I had felt when I came near to quarrelling with Gilberte, an anguish which I had attributed, on every recurrence of it, to the distressing prospect of never seeing my friend again or of running the risk of seeing her only when she was a prey to the same ill-humour. But if this medicine had been at the root of the sufferings which my imagination must in that case have interpreted wrongly not that there would be anything e traordinary in that, seeing that, among lovers, the most acute mental suffering assumes often the physical identity of the woman with whom they are living, it had been, in that sense, like the philtre which, long after they have drunk of it, continues to bind Tristan to Isolde. For the physical improvement which the reduction of my caffeine effected almost at once did not arrest the evolution of that grief which my absorption of the to in had perhaps \\u2014 if it had not created it \\u2014 at any rate contrived to render more acute  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Only, as the middle of the month of January approached, once my hopes of a letter on New Year\\u2019s Day had been disappointed, once the additional disturbance that had come with their disappointment had grown calm, it was my old sorrow, that of \\u2018before the holidays,\\u2019 which began again. What was perhaps the most cruel thing about it was that I myself was its architect, unconscious, wilful, merciless and patient. The one thing that mattered, my relations with Gilberte, it was I who was labouring to make them impossible by gradually creating out of this prolonged separation from my friend, not indeed her indifference, but what would come to the same thing in the end, my own. It was to a slow and painful suicide of that part of me which was Gilberte\\u2019s lover that I was goading myself with untiring energy, with a clear sense not only of what I was presently doing but of what must result from it in the future; I knew not only that after a certain time I should cease to love Gilberte, but also that she herself would regret it and that the attempts which she would then make to see me would be as vain as those that she was making now, no longer because I loved her too well but because I should certainly be in love with some other woman whom I should continue to desire, to wait for, through hours of which I should not dare to divert any particle of a second to Gilberte who would be nothing to me then. And no doubt at that very moment in which since I was determined not to see her again, unless after a formal request for an e planation or a full confession of love on her part, neither of which was in the least degree likely to come to me now I had already lost Gilberte, and loved her more than ever, and could feel all that she was to me better than in the previous year when, spending all my afternoons in her company, or as many as I chose, I believed that no peril threatened our friendship \\u2014 no doubt at that moment the idea that I should one day entertain identical feelings for another was odious to me, for that idea carried me away beyond the range of Gilberte, my love and my sufferings. My love, my sufferings in which through my tears I attempted to discern precisely what Gilberte was, and was obliged to recognise that they did not pertain e clusively to her but would, sooner or later, be some other woman\\u2019s portion. So that \\u2014 or such, at least, was my way of thinking then \\u2014 we are always detached from our fellow-creatures; when a man loves one of them he feels that his love is not labelled with their two names, but may be born again in the future, may have been born already in the past for another and not for her. And in the time when he is not in love, if he makes up his mind philosophically as to what it is that is inconsistent in love, he will find that the love of which he can speak unmoved he did not, at the moment of speaking, feel, and therefore did not know, knowledge in these matters being intermittent and not outlasting the actual presence of the sentiment. That future in which I should not love Gilberte, which my sufferings helped me to divine although my imagination was not yet able to form a clear picture of it, certainly there would still have been time to warn Gilberte that it was gradually taking shape, that its coming was, if not imminent, at least inevitable, if she herself, Gilberte, did not come to my rescue and destroy in the germ my nascent indifference. How often was I not on the point of writing, or of going to Gilberte to tell her: \\u201cTake care. My mind is made up. What I am doing now is my supreme effort. I am seeing you now for the last time. Very soon I shall have ceased to love you.\\u201d But to what end? By what authority should I have reproached Gilberte for an indifference which, not that I considered myself guilty on that count, I too manifested towards everything that was not herself? The last time! To me, that appeared as something of immense significance, because I was in love with Gilberte. On her it would doubtless have made just as much impression as those letters in which our friends ask whether they may pay us a visit before they finally leave the country, an offer which, like those made by tiresome women who are in love with us, we decline because we have pleasures of our own in prospect. The time which we have at our disposal every day is elastic; the passions that we feel e pand it, those that we inspire contract it; and habit fills up what remains  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Besides, what good would it have done if I had spoken to Gilberte; she would not have understood me. We imagine always when we speak that it is our own ears, our own mind that are listening. My words would have come to her only in a distorted form, as though they had had to pass through the moving curtain of a waterfall before they reached my friend, unrecognisable, giving a foolish sound, having no longer any kind of meaning. The truth which one puts into one\\u2019s words does not make a direct path for itself, is not supported by irresistible evidence. A considerable time must elapse before a truth of the same order can take shape in the words themselves. Then the political opponent who, despite all argument, every proof that he has advanced to damn the votary of the rival doctrine as a traitor, will himself have come to share the hated conviction by which he who once sought in vain to disseminate it is no longer bound. Then the masterpiece of literature whidi for the admirers who read it aloud seemed to make self-evident the proofs of its e cellence, while to those who listened it presented only a senseless or commonplace image, will by these too be proclaimed a masterpiece, but too late for the author to learn of their discovery. Similarly in love the barriers, do what one may, cannot be broken down from without by him whom they maddeningly e clude; it is when he is no longer concerned with them that suddenly, as the result of aft effort directed from elsewhere, accomplished within the heart of her who did not love him, those barriers which he has charged without success will fall to no advantage. If I had come to Gilberte to tell her of my future indifference and the means of preventing it, she would have assumed from my action that my love for her, the need that I had of her, were even greater than I had supposed, and her distaste for the sight of me would thereby have been increased. And incidentally it is quite true that it was that love for her which helped me, by means of the incongruous states of mind which it successively produced in me, to foresee, more clearly than she herself could, the end of that love. And yet some such warning I might perhaps have addressed, by letter or with my own lips, to Gilberte, after a long enough interval, which would render her, it is true, less indispensable to me, but would also have proved to her that she was not so indispensable. Unfortunately certain persons \\u2014 of good or evil intent \\u2014 spoke of me to her in a fashion which must have led her to think that they were doing so at my request. Whenever I thus learned that Cottard, my own mother, even M. de Norpois had by a few ill-chosen words rendered useless all the sacrifice that I had just been making, wasted all the advantage of my reserve by giving me, wrongly, the appearance of having emerged from it, I was doubly angry. In the first place I could no longer reckon from any date but the present my laborious and fruitful abstention which these tiresome people had, unknown to me, interrupted and so brought to nothing. And not only that; I should have less pleasure in seeing Gilberte, who would think of me now no longer as containing myself in dignified resignation, but as plotting in the dark for an interview which she had scorned to grant me. I cursed all the idle chatter of people who so often, without any intention of hurting us or of doing us a service, for no reason, for talking\\u2019s sake, often because we ourselves have not been able to refrain from talking in their presence, and because they are indiscreet as we ourselves are, do us, at a crucial moment, so much harm. It is true that in the grim operation performed for the eradication of our love they are far from playing a part equal to that played by two persons who are in the habit, from e cess of good nature in one and of malice in the Other, of undoing everything at the moment when everything is on the point of being settled. But against these two persons we bear no such grudge as against the inopportune Cottards of this world, for the latter of them is the person whom we love and the former is ourself  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Meanwhile, since on almost every occasion of my going to see her Mme. Swann would invite me to come to tea another day, with her daughter, and tell me to reply directly to her, I was constantly writing to Gilberte, and in this correspondence I did not choose the e pressions which might, I felt, have won her over, sought only to carve out the easiest channel for the torrent of my tears. For, like desire, regret seeks not to be analysed but to be satisfied. When one begins to love, one spends one\\u2019s time, not in getting to know what one\\u2019s love really is, but in making it possible to meet ne t day. When one abandons love one seeks not to know one\\u2019s grief but to offer to her who is causing it that e pression of it which seems to one the most moving. One says the things which one feels the need of saying, and which the other will not understand, one speaks for oneself alone. I wrote: \\u201cI had thought that it would not be possible. Alas, I see now that it is not so difficult.\\u201d I said also: \\u201cI shall probably not see you again;\\u201d I said it while I continued to avoid shewing a coldness which she might think affected, and the words, as I wrote them, made me weep because I felt that they e pressed not what I should have liked to believe but what was probably going to happen. For at the ne t request for a meeting which she would convey to me I should have again, as I had now, the courage not to yield, and, what with one refusal and another, I should gradually come to the moment when, by virtue of not having seen her again, I should not wish to see her. I wept, but I found courage enough to sacrifice, I tasted the sweets of sacrificing the happiness of being with her to the probability of seeming attractive to her one day, a day when, alas, my seeming attractive to her would be immaterial to me. Even the supposition, albeit so far from likely, that at this moment, as she had pretended during the last visit that I had paid her, she loved me, that what I took for the boredom which one feels in the company of a person of whom one has grown tired had been due only to a jealous susceptibility, to a feint of indifference analogous to my own, only rendered my decision less painful. It seemed to me that in years to come, when we had forgotten one another, when I should be able to look back and tell her that this letter which I was now in course of writing had not been for one moment sincere, she would answer, \\u201cWhat, you really did love me, did you? If you had only known how I waited for that letter, how I hoped that you were coming to see me, how I cried when I read it.\\u201d The thought, while I was writing it, immediately on my return from her mother\\u2019s house, that I was perhaps helping to bring about that very misunderstanding, that thought, by the sadness in which it plunged me, by the pleasure of imagining that I was loved by Gilberte, gave me the impulse to continue my letter  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 If, at the moment of leaving Mme. Swann, when her tea-party ended, I was thinking of what I was going to write to her daughter, Mme. Cottard, as she departed, had been filled with thoughts of a wholly different order. On her little \\u2018tour of inspection\\u2019 she had not failed to congratulate Mme. Swann on the new \\u2018pieces,\\u2019 the recent \\u2018acquisitions\\u2019 which caught the eye in her drawing-room. She could see among them some, though only a very few, of the things that Odette had had in the old days in the Rue La P\\u00e9rouse, for instance her animals carved in precious stones, her fetishes  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 For since Mme. Swann had picked up from a friend whose opinion she valued the word \\u2018dowdy\\u2019\\u2014 which had opened to her a new horizon because it denoted precisely those things which a few years earlier she had considered \\u2018smart\\u2019\\u2014 all those things had, one after another, followed into retirement the gilded trellis that had served as background to her chrysanthemums, innumerable bo es of sweets from Girou \\u2019s, and the coroneted note-paper not to mention the coins of gilt pasteboard littered about on the mantelpieces, which, even before she had come to know Swann, a man of taste had advised her to sacrifice. Moreover in the artistic disorder, the studio-like confusion of the rooms, whose walls were still painted in sombre colours which made them as different as possible from the white-enamelled drawing-rooms in which, a little later, you were to find Mme. Swann installed, the Far East recoiled more and more before the invading forces of the eighteenth century; and the cushions which, to make me \\u2018comfortable,\\u2019 Mme. Swann heaped up and buffeted into position behind my back were sprinkled with Louis XV garlands and not, as of old, with Chinese dragons. In the room in which she was usually to be found, and of which she would say, \\u201cYes, I like this room; I use it a great deal. I couldn\\u2019t live with a lot of horrid vulgar things swearing at me all the time; this is where I do my work \\u2014\\u2014\\u201d though she never stated precisely at what she was working. Was it a picture? A book, perhaps, for the hobby of writing was beginning to become common among women who liked to \\u2018do something,\\u2019 not to be quite useless. She was surrounded by Dresden pieces having a fancy for that sort of porcelain, which she would name with an English accent, saying in any conne ion: \\u201cHow pretty that is; it reminds me of Dresden flowers,\\u201d, and dreaded for them even more than in the old days for her grotesque figures and her flower-pots the ignorant handling of her servants who must e piate, every now and then, the an iety that they had caused her by submitting to outbursts of rage at which Swann, the most courteous and considerate of masters, looked on without being shocked. Not that the clear perception of certain weaknesses in those whom we love in any way diminishes our affection for them; rather that affection makes us find those weaknesses charming. Rarely nowadays was it in one of those Japanese wrappers that Odette received her familiars, but rather in the bright and billowing silk of a Watteau gown whose flowering foam she made as though to caress where it covered her bosom, and in which she immersed herself, looked solemn, splashed and sported, with such an air of comfort, of a cool skin and long-drawn breath, that she seemed to look on these garments not as something decorative, a mere setting for herself, but as necessary, in the same way as her \\u2018tub\\u2019 or her daily \\u2018outing,\\u2019 to satisfy the requirements of her style of beauty and the niceties of hygiene. She used often to say that she would go without bread rather than give up \\u2018art\\u2019 and \\u2018having nice things about her,\\u2019 and that the burning of the \\u2018Gioconda\\u2019 would distress her infinitely more than the destruction, by the same element, of \\u2018millions\\u2019 of the people she knew. Theories which seemed parado ical to her friends, but made her pass among them as a superior woman, and qualified her to receive a visit once a week from the Belgian Minister, so that in the little world whose sun she was everyone would have been greatly astonished to learn that elsewhere \\u2014 at the Verdurins\\u2019, for instance \\u2014 she was reckoned a fool. It was this vivacity of e pression that made Mme. Swann prefer men\\u2019s society to women\\u2019s. But when she criticised the latter it was always from the courtesan\\u2019s standpoint, singling out the blemishes that might lower them in the esteem of men, a lumpy figure, a bad comple ion, inability to spell, hairy legs, foul breath, pencilled eyebrows. But towards a woman who had shewn her kindness or indulgence in the past she was more lenient, especially if this woman were now in trouble. She would defend her warmly, saying: \\u201cPeople are not fair to her. I assure you, she\\u2019s quite a nice woman really.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 It was not only the furniture of Odette\\u2019s drawing-room, it was Odette herself that Mme. Cottard and all those who had frequented the society of Mme. de Cr\\u00e9cy would have found it difficult, if they had not seen her for some little time, to recognise. She seemed to be so much younger. No doubt this was partly because she had grown stouter, was in better condition, seemed at once calmer, more cool, more restful, and also because the new way in which she braided her hair gave more breadth to a face which was animated by an application of pink powder, and into which her eyes and profile, formerly too prominent, seemed now to have been reabsorbed. But another reason for this change lay in the fact that, having reached the turning-point of life, Odette had at length discovered, or invented, a physiognomy of her own, an unalterable \\u2018character,\\u2019 a \\u2018style of beauty\\u2019 and on her incoherent features \\u2014 which for so long, e posed to every hazard, every weakness of the flesh, borrowing for a moment, at the slightest fatigue, from the years to come, a sort of flickering shadow of anility, had furnished her, well or ill, according to how she was feeling, how she was looking, with a countenance dishevelled, inconstant, formless and attractive \\u2014 had now set this fi ed type, as it were an immortal youthfulness  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Swann had in his room, instead of the handsome photographs that were now taken of his wife, in all of which the same cryptic, victorious e pression enabled one to recognise, in whatever dress and hat, her triumphant face and figure, a little old daguerreotype of her, quite plain, taken long before the appearance of this new type, so that the youth and beauty of Odette, which she had not yet discovered when it was taken, appeared to be missing from it. But it is probable that Swann, having remained constant, or having reverted to a different conception of her, enjoyed in the slender young woman with pensive eyes and tired features, caught in a pose between rest and motion, a more Botticellian charm. For he still liked to recognise in his wife one of Botticelli\\u2019s figures. Odette, who on the other hand sought not to bring out but to make up for, to cover and conceal the points in herself that did not please her, what might perhaps to an artist e press her \\u2018character\\u2019 but in her woman\\u2019s eyes were merely blemishes, would not have that painter mentioned in her presence. Swann had a wonderful scarf of oriental silk, blue and pink, which he had bought because it was e actly that worn by Our Lady in the Magnificat. But Mme. Swann refused to wear it. Once only she allowed her husband to order her a dress covered all over with daisies, cornflowers, forget-me-nots and campanulas, like that of the Primavera. And sometimes in the evening, when she was tired, he would quietly draw my attention to the way in which she was giving, quite unconsciously, to her pensive hands the uncontrolled, almost distraught movement of the Virgin who dips her pen into the inkpot that the angel holds out to her, before writing upon the sacred page on which is already traced the word \\u2018Magnificat.\\u2019 But he added, \\u201cWhatever you do, don\\u2019t say anything about it to her; if she knew she was doing it, she would change her pose at once.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Save at these moments of involuntary rela ation, in which Swann essayed to recapture the melancholy cadence of Botticelli, Odette seemed now to be cut out in a single figure, wholly confined within a line which, following the contours of the woman, had abandoned the winding paths, the capricious re-entrants and salients, the radial points, the elaborate dispersions of the fashions of former days, but also, where it was her anatomy that went wrong by making unnecessary digressions within or without the ideal circumference traced for it, was able to rectify, by a bold stroke, the errors of nature, to make up, along a whole section of its course, for the failure as well of the human as of the te tile element. The pads, the preposterous \\u2018bustle\\u2019 had disappeared, as well as those tailed corsets which, projecting under the skirt and stiffened by rods of whalebone, had so long amplified Odette with an artificial stomach and had given her the appearance of being composed of several incongruous pieces which there was no individuality to bind together. The vertical fall of fringes, the curve of trimmings had made way for the infle ion of a body which made silk palpitate as a siren stirs the waves, gave to cambric a human e pression now that it had been liberated, like a creature that had taken shape and drawn breath, from the long chaos and nebulous envelopment of fashions at length dethroned. But Mme. Swann had chosen, had contrived to preserve some vestiges of certain of these, in the very thick of the more recent fashions that had supplanted them. When in the evening, finding myself unable to work and feeling certain that Gilberte had gone to the theatre with friends, I paid a surprise visit to her parents, I used often to find Mme. Swann in an elegant dishabille the skirt of which, of one of those rich dark colours, blood-red or orange, which seemed always as though they meant something very special, because they were no longer the fashion, was crossed diagonally, though not concealed, by a broad band of black lace which recalled the flounces of an earlier day. When on a still chilly afternoon in Spring she had taken me before my rupture with her daughter to the Jardin d\\u2019Acclimatation, under her coat, which she opened or buttoned up according as the e ercise made her feel warm, the dog-toothed border of her blouse suggested a glimpse of the lapel of some non-e istent waistcoat such as she had been accustomed to wear, some years earlier, when she had liked their edges to have the same slight indentations; and her scarf \\u2014 of that same \\u2018Scotch tartan\\u2019 to which she had remained faithful, but whose tones she had so far softened, red becoming pink and blue lilac, that one might almost have taken it for one of those pigeon\\u2019s-breast taffetas which were the latest novelty \\u2014 was knotted in such a way under her chin, without one\\u2019s being able to make out where it was fastened, that one could not help being reminded of those bonnet-strings which were \\u2014 now no longer worn. She need only \\u2018hold out\\u2019 like this for a little longer and young men attempting to understand her theory of dress would say: \\u201cMme. Swann is quite a period in herself, isn\\u2019t she?\\u201d As in a fine literary style which overlays with its different forms and so strengthens a tradition which lies concealed among them, so in Mme. Swann\\u2019s attire those half-hinted memories of waistcoats or of ringlets, sometimes a tendency, at once repressed, towards the \\u2018all aboard,\\u2019 or even a distant and vague allusion to the \\u2018chase me\\u2019 kept alive beneath the concrete form the unfinished likeness of other, older forms which you would not have succeeded, now, in making a tailor or a dressmaker reproduce, but about which your thoughts incessantly hovered, and enwrapped Mme. Swann in a cloak of nobility \\u2014 perhaps because the sheer uselessness of these fripperies made them seem meant to serve some more than utilitarian purpose, perhaps because of the traces they preserved of vanished years, or else because there was a sort of personality permeating this lady\\u2019s wardrobe, which gave to the most dissimilar of her costumes a distinct family likeness. One felt that she did not dress simply for the comfort or the adornment of her body; she was surrounded by her garments as by the delicate and spiritualised machinery of a whole form of civilisation  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 When Gilberte, who, as a rule, gave her tea-parties on the days when her mother was \\u2018at home,\\u2019 had for some reason to go out, and I was therefore free to attend Mme. Swann\\u2019s \\u2018kettledrum,\\u2019 I would find her dressed in one of her lovely gowns, some of which were of taffeta, others of gros-grain, or of velvet, or of cr\\u00eape-de-Chine, or satin or silk, gowns which, not being loose like those that she generally wore in the house but buttoned up tight as though she were just going out in them, gave to her stay-at-home laziness on those afternoons something alert and energetic. And no doubt the daring simplicity of their cut was singularly appropriate to her figure and to her movements, which her sleeves appeared to be symbolising in colours that varied from day to day: one would have said that there was a sudden determination in the blue velvet, an easy-going good humour in the white taffeta, and that a sort of supreme discretion full of dignity in her way of holding out her arm had, in order to become visible, put on the appearance, dazzling with the smile of one who had made great sacrifices, of the black cr\\u00eape-de-Chine. But at the same time these animated gowns took from the complication of their trimmings, none of which had any practical value or served any conceivable purpose, something detached, pensive, secret, in harmony with the melancholy which Mme. Swann never failed to shew, at least in the shadows under her eyes and the drooping arches of her hands. Beneath the profusion of sapphire charms, enamelled four-leaf clovers, silver medals, gold medallions, turquoise amulets, ruby chains and topaz chestnuts there would be, on the dress itself, some design carried out in colour which pursued across the surface of an inserted panel a preconceived e istence of its own, some row of little satin buttons, which buttoned nothing and could not be unbuttoned, a strip of braid that sought to please the eye with the minuteness, the discretion of a delicate reminder; and these, as well as the trinkets, had the effect \\u2014 for otherwise there would have been no possible justification of their presence \\u2014 of disclosing a secret intention, being a pledge of affection, keeping a secret, ministering to a superstition, commemorating a recovery from sickness, a granted wish, a love affair or a \\u2018philippine.\\u2019 And now and then in the blue velvet of the bodice a hint of \\u2018slashes,\\u2019 in the Henri II style, in the gown of black satin a slight swelling which, if it was in the sleeves, just below the shoulders, made one think of the \\u2018leg of mutton\\u2019 sleeves of 1830, or if, on the other hand, it was beneath the skirt, with its Louis XV paniers, gave the dress a just perceptible air of being \\u2018fancy dress\\u2019 and at all events, by insinuating beneath the life of the present day a vague reminiscence of the past, blended with the person of Mme. Swann the charm of certain heroines of history or romance. And if I were to draw her attention to this: \\u201cI don\\u2019t play golf,\\u201d she would answer, \\u201clike so many of my friends. So I should have no e cuse for going about, as they do, in sweaters.\\u201d  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 In the confusion of her drawing-room, on her way from shewing out one visitor, or with a plateful of cakes to \\u2018tempt\\u2019 another, Mme. Swann as she passed by me would take me aside for a moment: \\u201cI have special instructions from Gilberte that you are to come to luncheon the day after to-morrow. As I wasn\\u2019t sure of seeing you here, I was going to write to you if you hadn\\u2019t come.\\u201d I continued to resist. And this resistance was costing me steadily less and less, because, however much one may love the poison that is destroying one, when one has compulsorily to do without it, and has had to do without it for some time past, one cannot help attaching a certain value to the peace of mind which one had ceased to know, to the absence of emotion and suffering. If one is not altogether sincere in assuring oneself that one does not wish ever to see again her whom one loves, one would not be a whit more sincere in saying that one would like to see her. For no doubt one can endure her absence only when one promises oneself that it shall not be for long, and thinks of the day on which one shall see her again, but at the same time one feels how much less painful are those daily recurring dreams of a meeting immediate and incessantly postponed than would be an interview which might be followed by a spasm of jealousy, with the result that the news that one is shortly to see her whom one loves would cause a disturbance which would be none too pleasant. What one procrastinates now from day to day is no longer the end of the intolerable an iety caused by separation, it is the dreaded renewal of emotions which can lead to nothing. How infinitely one prefers to any such interview the docile memory which one can supplement at one\\u2019s pleasure with dreams, in which she who in reality does not love one seems, far from that, to be making protestations of her love for one, when one is by oneself; that memory which one can contrive, by blending gradually with it a portion of what one desires, to render as pleasing as one may choose, how infinitely one prefers it to the avoided interview in which one would have to deal with a creature to whom one could no longer dictate at one\\u2019s pleasure the words that one would like to hear on her lips, but from whom one would meet with fresh coldness, unlooked-for violence. We know, all of us, when we no longer love, that forgetfulness, that even a vague memory do not cause us so much suffering as an ill-starred love. It was of such forgetfulness that in anticipation I preferred, without acknowledging it to myself, the reposeful tranquillity  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Moreover, whatever discomfort there may be in such a course of psychical detachment and isolation grows steadily less for another reason, namely that it weakens while it is in process of healing that fi ed obsession which is a state of love. Mine was still strong enough for me to be able to count upon recapturing my old position in Gilberte\\u2019s estimation, which in view of my deliberate abstention must, it seemed to me, be steadily increasing; in other words each of those calm and melancholy days on which I did not see her, coming one after the other without interruption, continuing too without prescription unless some busy-body were to meddle in my affairs, was a day not lost but gained. Gained to no purpose, it might be, for presently they would be able to pronounce that I was healed. Resignation, modulating our habits, allows certain elements of our strength to be indefinitely increased. Those \\u2014 so wretchedly inadequate \\u2014 that I had had to support my grief, on the first evening of my rupture with Gilberte, had since multiplied to an incalculable power. Only, the tendency which everything that e ists has to prolong its own e istence is sometimes interrupted by sudden impulses to which we give way with all the fewer scruples over letting ourselves go since we know for how many days, for how many months even we have been able, and might still be able to abstain. And often it is when the purse in which we hoard our savings is nearly full that we undo and empty it, it is without waiting for the result of our medical treatment and when we have succeeded in growing accustomed to it that we abandon it. So, one day, when Mme. Swann was repeating her familiar statement of what a pleasure it would be to Gilberte to see me, thus putting the happiness of which I had now for so long been depriving myself, as it were within arm\\u2019s length, I was stupefied by the realisation that it was still possible for me to enjoy that pleasure, and I could hardly wait until ne t day, when I had made up my mind to take Gilberte by surprise, in the evening, before dinner  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 What helped me to remain patient throughout the long day that followed was another plan that I had made. From the moment in which everything was forgotten, in which I was reconciled to Gilberte, I no longer wished to visit her save as a lover. Every day she should receive from me the finest flowers that grew. And if Mme. Swann, albeit she had no right to be too severe a mother, should forbid my making a daily offering of flowers, I should find other gifts, more precious and less frequent. My parents did not give me enough money for me to be able to buy e pensive things. I thought of a big bowl of old Chinese porcelain which had been left to me by aunt L\\u00e9onie, and of which Mamma prophesied daily that Fran\\u00e7oise would come running to her with an \\u201cOh, it\\u2019s all come to pieces!\\u201d and that that would be the end of it. Would it not be wiser, in that case, to part with it, to sell it so as to be able to give Gilberte all the pleasure I could. I felt sure that I could easily get a thousand francs for it. I had it tied up in paper; I had grown so used to it that I had ceased altogether to notice it; parting with it had at least the advantage of making me realise what it was like. I took it with me as I started for the Swanns\\u2019, and, giving the driver their address, told him to go by the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es, at one end of which was the shop of a big dealer in oriental things, who knew my father. Greatly to my surprise he offered me there and then not one thousand but ten thousand francs for the bowl. I took the notes with rapture. Every day, for a whole year, I could smother Gilberte in roses and lilac. When I left the shop and got into my cab again the driver naturally enough, since the Swanns lived out by the Bois instead of taking the ordinary way began to drive me along the Avenue des Champs-Elys\\u00e9es. He had just passed the end of the Rue de Berri when, in the failing light, I thought I saw, close to the Swanns\\u2019 house but going in the other direction, going away from it, Gilberte, who was walking slowly, though with a firm step, by the side of a young man with whom she was conversing, but whose face I could not distinguish. I stood up in the cab, meaning to tell the driver to stop; then hesitated. The strolling couple were already some way away, and the parallel lines which their leisurely progress was quietly drawing were on the verge of disappearing in the Elysian gloom. A moment later, I had reached Gilberte\\u2019s door. I was received by Mme. Swann. \\u201cOh! she will be sorry!\\u201d was my greeting, \\u201cI can\\u2019t think why she isn\\u2019t in. She came home just now from a lesson, complaining of the heat, and said she was going out for a little fresh air with another girl.\\u201d \\u201cI fancy I passed her in the Avenue des Champs-Elys\\u00e9es.\\u201d \\u201cOh, I don\\u2019t think it can have been. Anyhow, don\\u2019t mention it to her father; he doesn\\u2019t approve of her going out at this time of night. Must you go? Good-bye.\\u201d I left her, told my driver to go home the same way, but found no trace of the two walking figures. Where had they been? What were they saying to one another in the darkness so confidentially?  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 I returned home, desperately clutching my windfall of ten thousand francs, which would have enabled me to arrange so many pleasant surprises for that Gilberte whom now I had made up my mind never to see again. No doubt my call at the dealer\\u2019s had brought me happiness by allowing me to e pect that in future, whenever I saw my friend, she would be pleased with me and grateful. But if I had not called there, if my cabman had not taken the Avenue des Champs-Elys\\u00e9es, I should not have seen Gilberte with that young man. Thus a single action may have two contradictory effects, and the misfortune that it engenders cancel the good fortune that it has already brought one. There had befallen me the opposite of what so frequently happens. We desire some pleasure, and the material means of obtaining it are lacking. \\u201cIt is a mistake,\\u201d Labruy\\u00e8re tells us, \\u201cto be in love without an ample fortune.\\u201d There is nothing for it but to attempt a gradual elimination of our desire for that pleasure. In my case, however, the material means had been forthcoming, but at the same moment, if not by a logical effect, at any rate as a fortuitous consequence of that initial success, my pleasure had been snatched from me  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 As, for that matter, it seems as though it must always be. As a rule, however, not on the same evening on which we have acquired what makes it possible. Usually, we continue to struggle and to hope for a little longer. But the pleasure can never be realised. If we succeed in overcoming the force of circumstances, nature at once shifts the battle-ground, placing it within ourselves, and effects a gradual change in our heart until it desires something other than what it is going to obtain. And if this transposition has been so rapid that our heart has not had time to change, nature does not, on that account, despair of conquering us, in a manner more gradual, it is true, more subtle, but no less efficacious. It is then, at the last moment, that the possession of our happiness is wrested from us, or rather it is that very possession which nature, with diabolical cleverness, uses to destroy our happiness. After failure in every quarter of the domain of life and action, it is a final incapacity, the mental incapacity for happiness, that nature creates in us. The phenomenon, of happiness either fails to appear, or at once gives way to the bitterest of reactions  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 I put my ten thousand francs in a drawer. But they were no longer of any use to me. I ran through them, as it happened, even sooner than if I had sent flowers every day to Gilberte, for when evening came I was always too wretched to stay in the house and used to go and pour out my sorrows upon the bosoms of women whom I did not love. As for seeking to give any sort of pleasure to Gilberte, I no longer thought of that; to visit her house again now could only have added to my sufferings. Even the sight of Gilberte, which would have been so e quisite a pleasure only yesterday, would no longer have sufficed me. For I should have been miserable all the time that I was not actually with her. That is how a woman, by every fresh torture that she inflicts on us, increases, often quite unconsciously, her power over us and at the same time our demands upon her. With each injury that she does us, she encircles us more and more completely, doubles our chains \\u2014 but halves the strength of those which hitherto we had thought adequate to bind her in order that we might retain our own peace of mind. Only yesterday, had I not been afraid of annoying Gilberte, I should have been content to ask for no more than occasional meetings, which now would no longer have contented me and for which I should now have substituted quite different terms. For in this respect love is not like war; after the battle is ended we renew the fight with keener ardour, which we never cease to intensify the more thoroughly we are defeated, provided always that we are still in a position to give battle. This was not my position with regard to Gilberte. Also I preferred, at first, not to see her mother again. I continued, it is true, to assure myself that Gilberte did not love me, that I had known this for ever so long, that I could see her again if I chose, and, if I did not choose, forget her in course of time. But these ideas, like a remedy which has no effect upon certain complaints, had no power whatsoever to obliterate those two parallel lines which I kept on seeing, traced by Gilberte and the young man as they slowly disappeared along the Avenue des Champs-Elys\\u00e9es. This was a fresh misfortune, which like the rest would gradually lose its force, a fresh image which would one day present itself to my mind\\u2019s eye completely purged of every no ious element that it now contained, like those deadly poisons which one can handle without danger, or like a crumb of dynamite which one can use to light one\\u2019s cigarette without fear of an e plosion. Meanwhile there was in me another force which was striving with all its might to overpower that unwholesome force which still shewed me, without alteration, the figure of Gilberte walking in the dusk: to meet and to break the shock of the renewed assaults of memory, I had, toiling effectively on the other side, imagination. The former force did indeed continue to shew me that couple walking in the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es, and offered me other disagreeable pictures drawn from the past, as for instance Gilberte shrugging her shoulders when her mother asked her to stay and entertain me. But the other force, working upon the canvas of my hopes, outlined a future far more attractively developed than this poor past which, after all, was so restricted. For one minute in which I saw Gilberte\\u2019s sullen face, how many were there in which I planned to my own satisfaction all the steps that she was to take towards our reconciliation, perhaps even towards our betrothal. It is true that this force, which my imagination was concentrating upon the future, it was drawing, for all that, from the past. I was still in love with her whom, it is true, I believed that I detested. But whenever anyone told me that I was looking well, or was nicely dressed, I wished that she could have been there to see me. I was irritated by the desire that many people shewed about this time to ask me to their houses, and refused all their invitations. There was a scene at home because I did not accompany my father to an official dinner at which the Bontemps were to be present with their niece Albertine, a young girl still hardly more than a child. So it is that the different periods of our life overlap one another. We scornfully decline, because of one whom we love and who will some day be of so little account, to see another who is of no account to-day, with whom we shall be in love to-morrow, with whom we might, perhaps, had we consented to see her now, have fallen in love a little earlier and who would thus have put a term to our present sufferings, bringing others, it is true, in their place. Mine were steadily growing less. I had the surprise of discovering in my own heart one sentiment one day, another the ne t, generally inspired by some hope or some fear relative to Gilberte. To the Gilberte whom I kept within me. I ought to have reminded myself that the other, the real Gilberte, was perhaps entirely different from mine, knew nothing of the regrets that I ascribed to her, was thinking probably less about me, not merely than I was thinking about her but that I made her be thinking about me when I was closeted alone with my fictitious Gilberte, wondering what really were her feelings with regard to me and so imagining her attention as constantly directed towards myself  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 During those periods in which our bitterness of spirit, though steadily diminishing, still persists, a distinction must be drawn between the bitterness which comes to us from our constantly thinking of the person herself and that which is revived by certain memories, some cutting speech, some word in a letter that we have had from her. The various forms which that bitterness can assume we shall e amine when we come to deal with another and later love affair; for the present it must suffice to say that, of these two kinds, the former is infinitely the less cruel. That is because our conception of the person, since it dwells always within ourselves, is there adorned with the halo with which we are bound before long to invest her, and bears the marks if not of the frequent solace of hope, at any rate of the tranquillity of a permanent sorrow. It must also be observed that the image of a person who makes us suffer counts for little if anything in those complications which aggravate the unhappiness of love, prolong it and prevent our recovery, just as in certain maladies the cause is insignificant beyond comparison with the fever which follows it and the time that must elapse before our convalescence. But if the idea of the person whom we love catches and reflects a ray of light from a mind which is on the whole optimistic, it is not so with those special memories, those cutting words, that inimical letter I received only one that could be so described from Gilberte; you would say that the person herself dwelt in those fragments, few and scattered as they were, and dwelt there multiplied to a power of which she falls ever so far short in the idea which we are accustomed to form of her as a whole. Because the letter has not \\u2014 as the image of the beloved creature has \\u2014 been contemplated by us in the melancholy calm of regret; we have read it, devoured it in the fearful anguish with which we were wrung by an unforeseen misfortune. Sorrows of this sort come to us in another way; from without; and it is along the road of the most cruel suffering that they have penetrated to our heart. The picture of our friend in our mind, which we believe to be old, original, authentic, has in reality been refashioned by her many times over. The cruel memory is not itself contemporary with the restored picture, it is of another age, it is one of the rare witnesses to a monstrous past. But inasmuch as this past continues to e ist, save in ourselves, who have been pleased to substitute for it a miraculous age of gold, a paradise in which all mankind shall be reconciled, those memories, those letters carry us back to reality, and cannot but make us feel, by the sudden pang they give us, what a long way we have been borne from that reality by the baseless hopes engendered daily while we waited for something to happen. Not that the said reality is bound always to remain the same, though that does indeed happen at times. There are in our life any number of women whom we have never wished to see again, and who have quite naturally responded to our in no way calculated silence with a silence as profound. Only in their case as we never loved them, we have never counted the years spent apart from them, and this instance, which would invalidate our whole argument, we are inclined to forget when we are considering the healing effect of isolation, just as people who believe in presentiments forget all the occasions on which their own have not \\u2018come true.\\u2019  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 But, after a time, absence may prove efficacious. The desire, the appetite for seeing us again may after all be reborn in the heart which at present contemns us. Only, we must allow time. Now the demands which we ourselves make upon time are no less e orbitant than those of a heart in process of changing. For one thing, time is the very thing that we are least willing to allow, for our own suffering is keen and we are an ious to see it brought to an end. And then, too, the interval of time which the other heart needs to effect its change our own heart will have spent in changing itself also, so that when the goal which we had set ourselves becomes attainable it will have ceased to count as a goal, or to seem worth attaining. This idea, however, that it will be attainable, that what, when it no longer spells any good fortune to us, we shall ultimately secure is not good fortune, this idea embodies a part, but a part only of the truth. Our good fortune accrues to us when we have grown indifferent to it. But the very fact of our indifference will have made us less e acting, and allow us in retrospect to feel convinced that we should have been in raptures over our good fortune had it come at a time when, very probably, it would have seemed to us miserably inadequate. People are not very hard to satisfy nor are they very good judges of matters in which they take no interest. The friendly overtures of a person whom we no longer love, overtures which strike us, in our indifference to her, as e cessive, would perhaps have fallen a long way short of satisfying our love. Those tender speeches, that invitation or acceptance, we think only of the pleasure which they would have given us, and not of all those other speeches and meetings by which we should have wished to see them immediately followed, which we should, as likely as not, simply by our avidity for them, have precluded from ever happening. So that we can never be certain that the good fortune which comes to us too late, when we are no longer in love, is altogether the same as that good fortune the want of which made us, at one time, so unhappy. There is only one person who could decide that; our ego of those days; he is no longer with us, and were he to reappear, no doubt that would be quite enough to make our good fortune \\u2014 whether identical or not \\u2014 vanish  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Pending these posthumous fulfilments of a dream in which I should not, when the time came, be greatly interested, by dint of my having to invent, as in the days when I still hardly knew Gilberte, speeches, letters in which she implored my forgiveness, swore that she had never loved anyone but myself and besought me to marry her, a series of pleasant images incessantly renewed came by degrees to hold a larger place in my mind than the vision of Gilberte and the young man, which had nothing now to feed upon. At this point I should perhaps have resumed my visits to Mme. Swann but for a dream that came to me, in which one of my friends, who was not, however, one that I could identify, behaved with the utmost treachery towards me and appeared to believe that I had been treacherous to him. Abruptly awakened by the nain which this dream had given me, and finding that it persisted after I was awake, I turned my thoughts back to the dream, racked my brains to discover who could have been the friend whom I had seen in my sleep, the sound of whose name \\u2014 a Spanish name \\u2014 was no longer distinct in my ears. Combining Joseph\\u2019s part with Pharaoh\\u2019s, I set to work to interpret my dream. I knew that, when one is interpreting a dream, it is often a mistake to pay too much attention to the appearance of the people one saw in it, who may perhaps have been disguised or have e changed faces, like those mutilated saints on the walls of cathedrals which ignorant archaeologists have restored, fitting the body of one to the head of another and confusing all their attributes and names. Those that people bear in a dream are apt to mislead us. The person with whom we are in love is to be recognised only by the intensity of the pain that we suffer. From mine I learned that, though transformed while I was asleep into a young man, the person whose recent betrayal still hurt me was Gilberte. I remembered then that, the last time I had seen her, on the day when her mother had forbidden her to go out to a dancing-lesson, she had, whether in sincerity or in make-believe, declined, laughing in a strange manner, to believe in the genuineness of my feeling for her. And by association this memory brought back to me another. Long before that, it had been Swann who would not believe in my sincerity, nor that I was a suitable friend for Gilberte. In vain had I written to him, Gilberte had brought back my letter and had returned it to me with the same incomprehensible laugh. She had not returned it to me at once: I remembered now the whole of that scene behind the clump of laurels. As soon as one is unhappy one becomes moral. Gilberte\\u2019s recent antipathy for me seemed to me a judgment delivered on me by life for my conduct that afternoon. Such judgments one imagines one can escape because one looks out for carriages when one is crossing the street, and avoids obvious dangers. But there are others that take effect within us. The accident comes from the side to which one has not been looking, from inside, from the heart. Gilberte\\u2019s words: \\u201cIf you like, we might go on wrestling,\\u201d made me shudder. I imagined her behaving like that, at home perhaps, in the linen-room, with the young man whom I had seen escorting her along the Avenue des Champs-Elys\\u00e9es. And so, just as when, a little time back, I had believed myself to be calmly established in a state of happiness, it had been fatuous in me, now that I had abandoned all thought of happiness, to take for granted that at least I had grown and was going to remain calm. For, so long as our heart keeps enshrined with any permanence the image of another person, it is not only our happiness that may at any moment be destroyed; when that happiness has vanished, when we have suffered, and, later, when we have succeeded in lulling our sufferings to sleep, the thing then that is as elusive, as precarious as ever our happiness was, is our calm. Mine returned to me in the end, for the cloud which, lowering our resistance, tempering our desires, has penetrated, in the train of a dream, the enclosure of our mind, is bound, in course of time, to dissolve, permanence and stability being assured to nothing in this world, not even to grief. Besides, those whose suffering is due to love are, as we say of certain invalids, their own physicians. As consolation can come to them only from the person who is the cause of their grief, and as their grief is an emanation from that person, it is there, in their grief itself, that they must in the end find a remedy: which it will disclose to them at a given moment, for as long as they turn it over in their minds this grief will continue to shew them fresh aspects of the loved, the regretted creature, at one moment so intensely hateful that one has no longer the slightest desire to see her, since before finding enjoyment in her company one would have first to make her suffer, at another so pleasant that the pleasantness in which one has invested her one adds to her own stock of good qualities and finds in it a fresh reason for hope. But even although the anguish that had reawakened in me did at length grow calm, I no longer wished \\u2014 e cept just occasionally \\u2014 to visit Mme. Swann. In the first place because, among those who love and have been forsaken, the state of incessant \\u2014 even if unconfessed \\u2014 e pectancy in which they live undergoes a spontaneous transformation, and, while to all appearance unchanged, substitutes for its original elements others that are precisely the opposite. The first were the consequences of \\u2014 a reaction from \\u2014 the painful incidents which had upset us. The tension of waiting for what is yet to come is mingled with fear, all the more since we desire at such moments, should no message come to us from her whom we love, to act for ourselves, and are none too confident of the success of a step which, once we have taken it, we may find it impossible to follow up. But presently, without our having noticed any change, this tension, which still endures, is sustained, we discover, no longer by our recollection of the past but by anticipation of an imaginary future. From that moment it is almost pleasant. Besides, the first state, by continuing for some time, has accustomed us to living in e pectation. The suffering that we felt during those last meetings survives in us still, but is already lulled to sleep. We are in no haste to arouse it, especially as we do not see very clearly what to ask for now. The possession of a little more of the woman whom we love would only make more essential to us the part that we did not yet possess, which is bound to remain, whatever happens, since our requirements are begotten of our satisfactions, an irreducible quantity  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 Another, final reason came later on to reinforce this, and to make me discontinue altogether my visits to Mme. Swann. This reason, slow in revealing itself, was not that I had now forgotten Gilberte but that I must make every effort to forget her as speedily as possible. No doubt, now that the keen edge of my suffering was dulled, my visits to Mme. Swann had become once again, for what sorrow remained in me, the sedative and distraction which had been so precious to me at first. But what made the sedative efficacious made the distraction impossible, namely that with these visits the memory of Gilberte was intimately blended. The distraction would be of no avail to me unless it was employed to combat a sentiment which the presence of Gilberte no longer nourished, thoughts, interests, passions in which Gilberte should have no part. These states of consciousness, to which the person whom we love remains a stranger, then occupy a place which, however small it may be at first, is always so much reconquered from the love that has been in unchallenged possession of our whole soul. We must seek to encourage these thoughts, to make them grow, while the sentiment which is no more now than a memory dwindles, so that the new elements  duced into our mind contest with that sentiment, wrest from it an ever increasing part of our soul, until at last the victory is complete. I decided that this was the only way in which my love could be killed, and I was still young enough, still courageous enough to undertake the attempt, to subject myself to that most cruel grief which springs from the certainty that, whatever time one may devote to the effort, it will prove successful in the end. The reason I now gave in my letters to Gilberte for refusing to see her was an allusion to some mysterious misunderstanding, wholly fictitious, which was supposed to have arisen between her and myself, and as to which I had hoped at first that Gilberte would insist upon my furnishing her with an e planation. But, as a matter of fact, never, even in the most insignificant relations in life, does a request for enlightenment come from a correspondent who knows that an obscure, untruthful, incriminating sentence has been written on purpose, so that he shall protest against it, and is only too glad to feel, when he reads it, that he possesses \\u2014 and to keep in his own hands \\u2014 the initiative in the coming operations. For all the more reason is this so in our more tender relations, in which love is endowed with so much eloquence, indifference with so little curiosity. Gilberte having never appeared to doubt nor sought to learn more about this misunderstanding, it became for me a real entity, to which I referred anew in every letter. And there is in these baseless situations, in the affectation of coldness, a sort of fascination which tempts one to persevere in them. By dint of writing: \\u201cNow that our hearts are sundered,\\u201d so that Gilberte might answer: \\u201cBut they are not. Do e plain what you mean,\\u201d I had gradually come to believe that they were. By constantly repeating, \\u201cLife may have changed for us, it will never destroy the feeling that we had for one another,\\u201d in the hope of hearing myself, one day, say: \\u201cBut there has been no change, the feeling is stronger now than ever it was,\\u201d I was living with the idea that life had indeed changed, that we should keep only the memory of a feeling which no longer e isted, as certain neurotics, from having at first pretended to be ill, end by becoming chronic invalids. Now, whenever I had to write to Gilberte, I brought my mind back to this imagined change, which, being now tacitly admitted by the silence which she preserved with regard to it in her replies, would in future subsist between us. Then Gilberte ceased to make a point of ignoring it. She too adopted my point of view; and, as in the speeches at official banquets, when the foreign Sovereign who is being entertained adopts practically the same e pressions as have just been used by the Sovereign who is entertaining him, whenever I wrote to Gilberte: \\u201cLife may have parted us; the memory of the days when we knew one another will endure,\\u201d she never failed to respond: \\u201cLife may have parted us; it cannot make us forget those happy hours which will always be dear to us both,\\u201d though we should have found it hard to say why or how \\u2018Life\\u2019-had parted us, or what change had occurred. My sufferings were no longer e cessive. And yet, one day when I was telling her in a letter that I had heard of the death of our old barley-sugar woman in the Champs-Elys\\u00e9es, as I wrote the words: \\u201cI felt at once that this would distress you, in me it awakened a host of memories,\\u201d I could not restrain myself from bursting into tears when I saw that I was speaking in the past tense, as though it were of some dead friend, now almost forgotten, of this love of which in spite of myself I had never ceased to think as of a thing still alive, or one that at least might be born again. Nothing can be more affectionate than this sort of correspondence between friends who do not wish to see one another any more. Gilberte\\u2019s letters to me had all the delicate refinement of those which I used to write to people who did not matter, and shewed me the same apparent marks of affection, which it was so pleasant for me to receive from her  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 But, as time went on, every refusal to see her disturbed me less. And as she became less dear to me, my painful memories were no longer strong enough to destroy by their incessant return the growing pleasure which I found in thinking of Florence, or of Venice. I regretted, at such moments, that I had abandoned the idea of diplomacy, and had condemned myself to a sedentary e istence, in order not to be separated from a girl whom I should not see again and had already almost forgotten. We construct our house of life to suit another person, and when at length it is ready to receive her that person does not come; presently she is dead to us, and we live on, a prisoner within the walls which were intended only for her. If Venice seemed to my parents to be a long way off, and its climate treacherous, it was at least quite easy for me to gov without tiring myself, and settle down at Balbec. But to do that I should have had to leave Paris, to forego those visits thanks to which, infrequent as they were, I might sometimes hear Mme. Swann telling me about her daughter. Besides, I was beginning to find in them various pleasures in which Gilberte had no part  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 When spring drew round, and with it the cold weather, during an icy Lent and the hailstorms of Holy Week, as Mme. Swann began to find it cold in the house, I used often to see her entertaining her guests in her furs, her shivering hands and shoulders hidden beneath the gleaming white carpet of an immense rectangular muff and a cape, both of ermine, which she had not taken off on coming in from her drive, and which suggested the last patches of the snows of winter, more persistent than the rest, which neither the heat of the fire nor the advancing season had succeeded in melting. And the whole truth about these glacial but already flowering weeks was suggested to me in this drawing-room, which soon I should be entering no more, by other more into icating forms of whiteness, that for e ample of the guelder-roses clustering, at the summits of their tall bare stalks, like the rectilinear trees in pre-Raphaelite paintings, their balls of blossom, divided yet composite, white as annunciating angels and breathing a fragrance as of lemons. For the mistress of Tansonville knew that April, even an ice-bound April, was not barren of flowers, that winter, spring, summer are not held apart by barriers as hermetic as might be supposed by the town-dweller who, until the first hot day, imagines the world as containing nothing but houses that stand naked in the rain. That Mme. Swann was content with the consignments furnished by her Combray gardener, that she did not, by the intervention of her own \\u2018special\\u2019 florist, fill up the gaps left by an insufficiently powerful magic with subsidies borrowed from a precocious Mediterranean shore, I do not for a moment suggest, nor did it worry me at the time. It was enough to fill me with longing for country scenes that, overhanging the loose snowdrifts of the muff in which Mme. Swann kept her hands, the guelder-rose snow-balls which served very possibly in the mind of my hostess no other purpose than to compose, on the advice of Bergotte, a \\u2018Symphony in White\\u2019 with her furniture and her garments reminded me that what the Good Friday music in Parsifal symbolised was a natural miracle which one could see performed every year, if one had the sense to look for it, and, assisted by the acid and heady perfume of the other kinds of blossom, which, although their names were unknown to me, had brought me so often to a standstill to gaze at them on my walks round Combray, made Mme. Swann\\u2019s drawing-room as virginal, as candidly \\u2018in bloom,\\u2019 without the least vestige of greenery, as overladen with genuine scents of flowers as was the little lane by Tansonville  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 But it was still more than I could endure that these memories should be recalled to me. There was a risk of their reviving what little remained of my love for Gilberte. Besides, albeit I no longer felt the least distress during these visits to Mme. Swann, I e tended the intervals between them and endeavoured to see as little of her as possible. At most, since I continued not to go out of Paris, I allowed myself an occasional walk with her. Fine weather had come at last, and the sun was hot. As I knew that before luncheon Mme. Swann used to go out every day for an hour, and would stroll for a little in the Avenue du Bois, near the Etoile \\u2014 a spot which, at that time, because of the people who used to collect there to gaze at the \\u2018swells\\u2019 whom they knew only by name, was known as the \\u2018Shabby-Genteel Club\\u2019\\u2014 I persuaded my parents, on Sundays for on weekdays I was busy all morning, to let me postpone my luncheon until long after theirs, until a quarter past one, and go for a walk before it. During May, that year, I never missed a Sunday, for Gilberte had gone to stay with friends in the country. I used to reach the Arc de Triomphe about noon. I kept watch at the entrance to the Avenue, never taking my eyes off the corner of the side-street along which Mme. Swann, who had only a few yards to walk, would come from her house. As by this time many of the people who had been strolling there were going home to luncheon, those who remained were few in number and, for the most part, fashionably dressed. Suddenly, on the gravelled path, unhurrying, cool, lu uriant, Mme. Swann appeared, displaying around her a toilet which was never twice the same, but which I remember as being typically mauve; then she hoisted and unfurled at the end of its long stalk, just at the moment when her radiance was most complete, the silken banner of a wide parasol of a shade that matched the showering petals of her gown. A whole troop of people escorted her; Swann himself, four or five fellows from the Club, who had been to call upon her that morning or whom she had met in the street: and their black or grey agglomeration, obedient to her every gesture, performing the almost mechanical movements of a lifeless setting in which Odette was framed, gave to this woman, in whose eyes alone was there any intensity, the air of looking out in front of her, from among all those men, as from a window behind which she had taken her stand, and made her emerge there, frail but fearless, in the nudity of her delicate colours, like the apparition of a creature of a different species, of an unknown race, and of almost martial strength, by virtue of which she seemed by herself a match for all her multiple escort. Smiling, rejoicing in the fine weather, in the sunshine which had not yet become trying, with the air of calm assurance of a creator who has accomplished his task and takes no thought for anything besides; certain that her clothes \\u2014 even though the vulgar herd should fail to appreciate them \\u2014 were the smartest anywhere to be seen, she wore them for herself and for her friends, naturally, without e aggerated attention to them but also without absolute detachment; not preventing the little bows of ribbon upon her bodice and skirt from floating buoyantly upon the air before her, like separate creatures of whose presence there she was not unconscious, but was indulgent enough to let them play if they chose, keeping their own rhythm, provided that they accompanied her where she led the way; and even upon her mauve parasol, which, as often as not, she had not yet \\u2018put up\\u2019 when she appeared on the scene, she let fall now and then, as though upon a bunch of Parma violets, a gaze happy and so kindly that, when it was fastened no longer upon her friends but on some inanimate object, her eyes still seemed to smile. She thus kept open, she made her garments occupy that interval of smartness, of which the men with whom she was on the most familiar terms respected both the e istence and its necessity, not without shewing a certain deference, as of profane visitors to a shrine, an admission of their own ignorance, an interval over which they recognised that their friend had as we recognise that a sick man has over the special precautions that he has to take, or a mother over her children\\u2019s education a competent jurisdiction. No less than by the court which encircled her and seemed not to observe\\u2019 the passers-by, Mme. Swann by the lateness of her appearance there at once suggested those rooms in which she had spent so long, so leisurely a morning and to which she must presently return for luncheon; she seemed to indicate their pro imity by the unhurrying ease of her progress, like the turn that one takes up and down one\\u2019s own garden; of those rooms one would have said that she was carrying about her still the cool, the indoor shade. But for that very reason the sight of her gave me only a stronger sensation of open air and warmth. All the more because, being assured in my own mind that, in accordance with the liturgy, with the ritual in which Mme. Swann was so profoundly versed, her clothes were connected with the time of year and of day by a bond both inevitable and unique, I felt that the flowers upon the stiff straw brim of her hat, the baby-ribbons upon her dress, had been even more naturally born of the month of May than the flowers in gardens and in woods; and to learn what latest change there was in weather or season I had not to raise my eyes higher than to her parasol, open and outstretched like another, a nearer sky, round, clement, mobile, blue. For these rites, if they were of sovereign importance, subjugated their glory and, consequently, Mme. Swann her own in condescending obedience to the day, the spring, the sun, none of which struck me as being sufficiently flattered that so elegant a woman had been graciously pleased not to ignore their e istence, and had chosen on their account a gown of a brighter, of a thinner fabric, suggesting to me, by the opening of its collar and sleeves, the moist warmness of the throat and wrists that they e posed \\u2014 in a word, had taken for them all the pains that a great personage takes who, having gaily condescended to pay a visit to common folk in the country, whom everyone, even the most plebeian, knows, yet makes a point of donning, for the occasion, suitable attire. On her arrival I would greet Mme. Swann, she stop me and say in English \\u2018Good morning,\\u2019 and smile. We would walk a little way together. And I learned then that these canons according to which she dressed, it was for her own satisfaction that she obeyed them, as though yielding to a Superior Wisdom of which she herself was High Priestess: for if it should happen that, feeling too warm, she threw open or even took off altogether and gave me to carry the jacket which she had intended to keep buttoned up, I would discover in the blouse beneath it a thousand details of e ecution which had had every chance of remaining there unperceived, like those parts of an orchestral score to which the composer has devoted infinite labour albeit they may never reach the ears of the public: or in the sleeves of the jacket that lay folded across my arm I would see, I would drink in slowly, for my own pleasure or from affection for its wearer, some e quisite detail, a deliciously tinted strip, a lining of mauve satinette which, ordinarily concealed from every eye, was yet just as delicately fashioned as the outer parts, like those gothic carvings on a cathedral, hidden on the inside of a balustrade eighty feet from the ground, as perfect as are the bas-reliefs over the main porch, and yet never seen by any living man until, happening to pass that way upon his travels, an artist obtains leave to climb up there among them, to stroll in the open air, sweeping the whole town with a comprehensive gaze, between the soaring towers  \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0 What enhanced this impression that Mme. Swann was walking in the Avenue as though along the paths of her own garden, was \\u2014 for people ignorant of her habit of \\u2018taking e ercise\\u2019\\u2014 that she had come there on foot, without any carriage following, she whom, once May had begun, they were accustomed to see, behind the most brilliant \\u2018turn-out,\\u2019 the smartest liveries in Paris, gently and majestically seated, like a goddess, in the balmy air of an immense victoria on eight springs. On foot Mme. Swann had the appearance \\u2014 especially as her pace began to slacken in the heat of the sun \\u2014 of having yielded to curiosity, of committing an \\u2018e clusive\\u2019 breach of all the rules of her code, like those Crowned Heads who, without consulting anyone, accompanied by the slightly scandalised admiration of a suite which dares not venture any criticism, step out of their bo es during a gala performance and visit the lobby of the theatre, mingling for a moment or two with the rest of the audience. So between Mme. Swann and themselves the crowd felt that there e isted those barriers of a certain kind of opulence which seem to them the most insurmountable that there are. The Faubourg Saint-Germain may have its barriers also, but these are less \\u2018telling\\u2019 to the eyes and imagination of the \\u2018shabby-genteel.\\u2019 These latter, when in the presence of a real personage, more simple, more easily mistaken for the wife of a small professional or business man, less remote from the people, will not feel the same sense of their own inequality, almost of their unworthiness, as dismays them when they encounter Mme. Swann. Of course women of that sort are not themselves dazzled, as the crowd are, by the brilliance of their apparel, they have ceased to pay any attention to it, but only because they have grown used to it, that is to say have come to look upon it more and more as natural and necessary, to judge their fellow creatures according as they are more or less initiated into these lu urious ways: so that the grandeur which they allow themselves to display or discover in others being wholly material, easily verified, slowly acquired, the lack of it hard to compensate if such women place a passer-by in the lowest rank of society, it is by the same instinctive process that has made them appear to him as in the highest, that is to say instinctively, at first sight, and without possibility of appeal. Perhaps that special class of society which included in those days women like Lady Israels, who mi ed with the women of the aristocracy, and Mme. Swann, who was to get to know them later on, that intermediate class, inferior to the Faubourg Saint-Germain, since it \\u2018ran after\\u2019 the denizens of that quarter, but superior to everything that was not of the Faubourg Saint-Germain, possessing this peculiarity that, while already detached from the world of the merely rich, it was riches still that it represented, but riches that had been canalised, serving a purpose, swayed by an idea that was artistic, malleable gold, chased with a poetic design, taught to smile; perhaps that class \\u2014 in the same form, at least, and with the same charm \\u2014 e ists no longer. In any event, the women who were its members would not satisfy to-day what was the primary condition on which they reigned, since with advancing age they have lost \\u2014 almost all of them \\u2014 their beauty. Whereas it was just as much as from the pinnacle of her noble fortune from the glorious zenith of her ripe and still so fragrant summer that Mme. Swann, majestic, smiling, kind, as she advanced along the Avenue du Bois, saw like Hypatia, beneath the slow tread of her feet, worlds revolving. Various young men as they passed looked at her an iously, not knowing whether their vague acquaintance with her especially since, having been  duced only once, at the most, to Swann, they were afraid that he might not remember them was sufficient e cuse for their venturing to take off their hats. And they trembled to think of the consequences as they made up their minds, asking themselves whether the gesture, so bold, so sacrilegious a tempting of providence, would not let loose the catastrophic forces of nature or bring down, upon them the vengeance of a jealous god. It provoked only, like the winding of a piece of clockwork, a series of gesticulations from little, responsive bowing figures, who were none other than Odette\\u2019s escort, beginning with Swann himself, who raised his tall hat lined in green leather with an e quisite courtesy, which he had acquired in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, but to which was no longer wedded the indifference that he would at one time have shewn. Its place was now taken as though he had been to some e tent permeated by Odette\\u2019s prejudices at once by irritation at having to acknowledge the salute of a person who was none too well dressed and by satisfaction at his wife\\u2019s knowing so many people, a mi ed sensation to which he gave e pression by saying to the smart friends who walked by his side: \\u201cWhatl another! Upon my word, I can\\u2019t imagine where my wife picks all these fellows up!\\u201d Meanwhile, having greeted with a slight movement of her head the terrified youth, who had already passed out of sight though his heart was still beating furiously, Mme. Swann turned to me: \\u201cThen it\\u2019s all over?\\u201d she put it to me, \\u201cYou aren\\u2019t ever coming to see Gilberte again? I\\u2019m glad you make an e ception of me, and are not going to \\u2018drop\\u2019 me straight away. I like seeing you, but I used to like also the influence you had over my daughter. I\\u2019m sure she\\u2019s very sorry about it, too. However, I mustn\\u2019t bully you, or you\\u2019ll make up your mind at once that you never want to set eyes on me again.\\u201d \\u201cOdette, Sagan\\u2019s trying to speak to you!\\u201d Swann called his wife\\u2019s attention. And there, indeed, was the Prince, as in some transformation scene at the close of a play, or in a circus, or an old painting, wheeling his horse round so as to face her, in a magnificent heroic pose, and doffing his hat with a sweeping theatrical and, so to speak, allegorical flourish in which he displayed all the chivalrous courtesy of a great noble bowing in token of his respect for Woman, were she incarnate in a woman whom it was impossible for his mother or his sister to know. And at every moment, recognised in the depths of the liquid transparency and of the luminous glaze of the shadow which her parasol cast over her, Mme. Swann was receiving the salutations of the last belated horsemen, who passed as though in a cinematograph taken as they galloped in the blinding glare of the Avenue, men from the clubs, the names of whom, which meant only celebrities to the public, Antoine de Castellane, Adalbert de Montmorency and the rest \\u2014 were for Mme. Swann the familiar names of friends. And as the average span of life, the relative longevity of our memories of poetical sensations is much greater than that of our memories of what the heart has suffered, long after the sorrows that I once felt on Gilberte\\u2019s account have faded and vanished, there has survived them the pleasure that I still derive \\u2014 whenever I close my eyes and read, as it were upon the face of a sundial, the minutes that are recorded between a quarter past twelve and one o\\u2019clock in the month of May \\u2014 from seeing myself once again strolling and talking thus with Mme. Swann beneath her parasol, as though in the coloured shade of a wistaria bower \",\n          \" Abstract  This essay e amines spaces within hip-hop culture where hip-hop feminist thought and activism might make significant interventions. It offers an e ploratory e amination of hip-hop feminism in an effort to map out an agenda for the twenty-first century. The essay is not concerned with hard-and-fast answers to the combination of feminism and hip-hop but rather with what hip-hop feminism might add to current conversations surrounding race, class, gender, and se uality. By e amining the conscious/commercial rap dichotomy, the discussions surrounding video models, lyrics by rapper Jean Grae, and the work of contemporary women authors, this essay opens the door for further dialogue about women, rap, and hip-hop feminismI know I\\u2019m on the right path To who I\\u2019m gonna be at last So don\\u2019t rush me I know I\\u2019m wrong and right At the same time both, I\\u2019m the dark and light And they say life means everything to live At the same time I got everything to give So don\\u2019t rush me Don\\u2019t rush me \\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0\\\\ a0-Jean Grae, \\u201cDon\\u2019t Rush Me\\u201d  Trying to capture the voice of all that is young black female was impossible.

The third wave represents the generation of feminists that hip-hop feminism is a part of. This generation of feminists is best represented theoretically in anthologies such as Listen Up: Voices from the Ne t Feminist Generation Findlen 1995, To Be Real: Telling the Truth and Changing the Face of Feminism Walker 1995, The Fire This Time: Young Activists and the New Feminism Labaton and Martin 2004, Colonize This! Young Women of Color on Today\\u2019s Feminism Hernandez and Rehman 2002, and Catching a Wave: Reclaiming Feminism for the 21st Century Dicker and Piepmeier 2003. The black feminist and womanist agendas are agendas that hip-hop feminists, the majority of whom are black women, share with their foremothers who saw their struggles with gender oppression as intimately connected to their struggles with race and class oppressions. They were women whose agendas kept firmly in sight the survival of the entire people. A hip-hop state of mind\\u2014one that freely samples, mi es, and remi es\\u2014influences the theoretical underpinnings of hip-hop feminism as well as the activism of hip-hop feminists. This essay highlights some of the ways hip-hop feminist agendas have taken shape while always keeping in mind, as the epigraphs from Jean Grae and Joan Morgan show, there won\\u2019t be just one truth but multiple ones. In fact, sometimes the contradictions that make for the \\u201cwrong and right . . . dark and light\\u201d of it will help feminists to better do what Joan Morgan suggests feminism needs to do\\u2014be \\u201cbrave enough to fuck with the grays\\u201d 1999, 59. This essay is an e ploratory essay that seeks to e amine the various articulations of hip-hop feminist e pressions as a way to provide a starting point and possible template for a hip-hop feminist agenda  Women have been representing in hip-hop culture ever since the mid 1970s, when the culture got its start in the South Bron , and they represent still. They have been and still are B-girls, women breakers, graffiti artists, deejays, and emcees. Today, we can add to the mi  women writing and thinking about the culture who call themselves hip-hop feminists. I take the stance that hip-hop is a cultural phenomenon that e pands beyond rap music. Hip-hop has been defined by many as a way of life that encompasses everything from way of dress to manner of speech. Hip-hop as a culture originally included graffiti writing, deejaying, break dancing, rap music, and the oft-forgotten fifth element, knowledge.   It has recently e panded to include genres such as film, spoken word, autobiographies, literature, journalism, and activism. It has also e panded enough to include its own brand of feminism. The writing of third-wave black feminist writers such as Ayana Byrd, Denise Cooper, Eisa Davis, Eisa Nefertari Ulen, Shani Jamilla, dream hampton, Joan Morgan, Tara Roberts, Kristal Brent-Zook, and Angela Ards is e panding black feminist theory and black women\\u2019s intellectual traditions in fascinating ways. What started out as a few young black feminist women who loved hip-hop and who tried to mesh that love with their feminist and womanist consciousness is now a rich body of articles, essays, poetry, and creative nonfiction. But what e actly is a hip-hop feminist? And what does hip-hop feminism do? I maintain that although we now have a relatively clear idea of what constitutes a hip-hop feminist, we are less certain about what a hip-hop feminist agenda should be  Hip-hop feminists are women and men who step up and speak out against gender e ploitation in hip-hop. From the Feminism and Hip-Hop Conference at the University of Chicago in 2005 to the B-Girl Be conferences in Minneapolis and countless symposiums and smaller conferences on the status of women in hip-hop to the list serves and Yahoo groups devoted to women, feminism, and hip-hop, there appears to be a surge in women and men thinking and talking about gender issues in hip-hop and combining that talk with action. From the publication of several key essays and Joan Morgan\\u2019s pivotal book When Chickenheads Come Home To Roost in the 1990s to the Spelman women who wanted to initiate a dialogue with Nelly to Essence Magazine\\u2019s \\u201cTake Back the Music\\u201d campaign, we can begin to see the ways this movement\\u2019s knowledge-building and consciousness-raising have taken shape. It might be too soon to talk about the impact that the movement has had, but it is not too soon to think about some of the key concerns and agendas that the movement seems to be taking up. I aim to flesh some of this out by building on some of the work that I did in my book Check It While I Wreck It: Black Womanhood, Hip-Hop Culture and the Public Sphere 2004 and by e amining a few areas where women have used hip-hop to claim a public voice. I want to look at the spaces where hip-hop feminism can make interventions as starting points for a possible feminist agenda in hip-hop. However, they will not all be feminist spaces or even have outright feminists messages. Instead, they are spaces where hip-hop feminists, activists, and thinkers can possibly evoke change  Krista Ratcliffe 2006 writes about giving her students a feminist literacy through which to read society. Elaine Richardson carefully details the ways in which the young women who listen to and love hip-hop process the images and have thoughtful and critical conversations about the culture and the music when she e amines female hip-hop literacies in her book Hiphop Literacies 2006.   And it has me thinking seriously about what a hip-hop feminist literacy would allow us to do and why we need one. Thinking of recent controversies such as Don Imus calling the Rutgers women\\u2019s basketball team \\u201cnappy-headed hoes\\u201d and Michael Richards\\u2019s meltdown in which he boldly and blatantly brandished the n-word at black men he thought were hecklers and the quick way just about everyone quickly made a move to blame hip-hop has me seriously considering what a worldwide hip-hop feminist literacy could give us in these situations. Would we continue to have conversations that blame rappers for white racist men doing what white racist men do all day every day? Or would we instead be able to really look at the nuances of the situation and see, for e ample, that while there was some racism underlying Imus\\u2019s statement, the se ism and underlying homophobia were palpable. And like racism, the se ism and homophobia predates hiphop in Imus\\u2019s politics and certainly in this country that deals with both on a regular. But even as we had these conversations and teased out these issues with our hip-hop feminist lens, we would still be able to critique hip-hop for its se ism and homophobia as well. We just wouldn\\u2019t blame hip-hop when people old enough to know better show their true colors, colors they have been showing all along. The fact is that young women who listen to rap music and participate in hip-hop culture already have critiques of se ism and misogyny. They have things to say about the culture and the world around them if we are prepared to listen. This essay is therefore an attempt at understanding what they might offer the larger society the ne t time we have such public pedagogical moments as those offered by Imus and Richards  So, Shorty\\u2019s a Feminist?  Several black and third-wave feminists have started to approach the tenuous relationship between rap music/hip-hop culture and feminism in their writing. They offer a variety of different feminist perspectives on rap, rappers, and women. Some condemn the se ism in rap and encourage others to do the same. Others offer complicated analyses that critique the larger societal issues that contribute to rap\\u2019s se ism, production, and consumption. Some offer third-wave feminist critiques that question how one can be a child of the hip-hop generation, love the music, and still critique and actively speak out against the se ism. They all offer e amples of how feminists have begun to deal with, think about, and write about rap music and hip-hop culture  Most hip-hop feminists believe that some of the needs of the hip-hop generation require new strategies and different voices. They have a strong   relationship to the \\u201cself,\\u201d and they connect their personal narratives with theoretical underpinnings and critique. They hold themselves and their peers responsible for effecting change in the present and future by encouraging people to recognize and combat their own complicity. In terms of rap music and hip-hop culture, they want to find ways to move beyond counting the amount of times a particular rapper says the word \\u201cbitch\\u201d or \\u201cho\\u201d to a focus on what they consider to be larger issues and concerns. For e ample, they also want to begin to complicate understandings of women\\u2019s complicity in the objectification of women especially as it pertains to video-hoes. And as Joan Morgan reminds us, \\u201cthe focus of Black feminists has got to change. We can\\u2019t afford to keep e pending energy on banal discussion of se ism in rap when se ism is only part of a huge set of problems\\u201d 1999, 76. They are concerned with and spend a lot of time writing about black women\\u2019s relationships with black men. They want to encourage a dialogue between black men and women, men rappers and women  A hip-hop feminist is more than just someone who likes to listen to rap music and feels conflicted about it. A hip-hop feminist is someone who is immersed in hip-hop culture and e periences hip-hop as a way of life. Hip-hop as a culture, in turn, influences his or her worldview or approach to life. In fact, one of the reasons why Elaine Richardson, Aisha Durham, Rachel Raimist, and I decided to edit Home Girls Make Some Noise: A Hip-Hop Feminism Anthology 2007 was because we wanted to think about hip-hop feminism beyond the conflicted, \\u201cI\\u2019m a feminist and I love hip-hop, woe-is-me\\u201d standpoint. We wanted to create a space to talk across disciplines through activism, the arts, and academia to better understand the very important and vital work going on in this area. Hip-hop feminists are working as community activists. They are working for reproductive justice. And they are trying to think about ways to combat the growing prison-industrial comple  in relation to women of color and the equally astounding HIV/AIDS rates. And they are also still very much concerned with representations of women of color in rap music videos and the harm that these images can do. So, I want to move now to one area that hip-hop feminism continues to grapple with: the video vi en  Shorty Wants to be a Star: Video Vi ens Representing Women of Color?  In her groundbreaking book, Prophets of the Hood, Imani Perry notes the following about the recent trends in hip-hop music videos: \\u201cIt seemed to happen suddenly. Every time one turned on BET Black Entertainment   Television or MTV, one encountered a disturbing music video: Black men rapped surrounded by dozens of black and Latina women dressed in bathing suits, or scantily clad in some other fashion. Video after video proved the same, each one more objectifying than the former. Some took place in strip clubs, some at the pool, at the beach, or in hotel rooms, but the recurrent theme was dozens of half-naked women\\u201d 2004, 175. With the release of Karrine Steffans\\u2019s tell-all memoir, Confessions of a Video Vi en 2005, the topic of women, music videos, and objectification is once again on everyone\\u2019s minds. But even more so, the questions surrounding objectification have become complicated in important ways. No longer can we make claims about what is happening to the women in the videos without complicating the discussion by adding their voices. Although Steffans says that she wrote the book as a cautionary tale for little girls who want to grow up and be video girls, the book reads more like a how-to with just enough name-dropping and gossip to fill inquiring minds. In fact, with the release of It\\u2019s No Secret by Carmen Bryan, rapper Nas\\u2019s e -girlfriend and the mother of his child, it seems as if some marketing person in the publishing industry figured out a way to capitalize on mi ing the current Zane-inspired erotica fervor with hip-hop glitterati in order to cater to a gossip-obsessed culture and recent trends in reality programming. These kinds of books appeal to a variety of people because of the way they play into the genres listed above. However, what does come across clearly as one reads the Steffans\\u2019s memoir and Bryan\\u2019s tell-all are the ways in which some women have chosen to buy into the se ism and misogyny that limits the roles that women can play in hip-hop culture  The issues of representation and objectification in hip-hop offer many variables that all must be considered if we are going to have a meaningful conversation about the topic. The ways in which the men artists and male and female video directors objectify the women in their lyrics and videos is one aspect. The ways in which the women video models and hip-hop artists choose to objectify themselves in a quest to make money and earn a living is another. And the way these images straddle the very thin line between validation of black women bodies and objectification is yet another aspect. The truth of the matter is that we are now in an historical moment where the bodies of women of color flood popular culture in ways that they never have before. As hip-hop culture e pands and dominates mainstream popular culture, the hip-hop video becomes more than just a music video. The impact of these videos on women of color is vast. Hip-hop music videos are spreading representations of U.S. women of color around the globe.   I have written elsewhere that hip-hop culture did not spring up full grown on its own and that it builds on other legacies that e ist in the culture and the community that we are not always willing to own see Pough 2001. Others have noted that hip-hop does not e ist in a social-cultural vacuum, that as a part of the larger culture it takes on elements of the larger culture as well see Potter 1995; Rose 1994. So when we look at the hip-hop centerfolds that e ist in Source Magazine and XXL, with their monthly \\u201cDime Piece\\u201d and \\u201cEye Candy\\u201d sections, we cannot discuss them in isolation and certainly not without at least mentioning the long-running Jet Magazine \\u201cBeauty of the Week.\\u201d And when we talk about the ways in which hip-hop videos are similar to pornography, we cannot have the conversation without looking at the ways in which pornography has infiltrated the larger culture as well. Can you say \\u201cgirls gone wild\\u201d?  None of this is meant to take away from the damage that these pornographic images of women of color in hip-hop do. What I do want to look at, however, are the ways in which these tropes impact our thoughts about women of color and how they in turn impact the lives of young women. The words of women like Zulaika Jumaralli 2005 who claim \\u201cMusic Videos Broke My Spirit\\u201d come to mind as I think about the power of these videos and the impact that they have. I think of women like the black women students at Duke, who, outraged by the recent alleged gang rape of a black woman by white members of the university lacrosse team, loudly proclaim, that they are \\u201cnot your video ho.\\u201d In an article written by Fiona Morgan 2006, these students share stories of being e pected to be se ually available and inappropriately propositioned by white men on campus just because of their race. One student says, \\u201cAs a black female, you go to a party. You\\u2019re e pected to dance. You\\u2019re e pected to be se ually provocative. You are e pected to want to be touched, to be grabbed, to be fondled.\\u201d Another student adds, \\u201cAs if they\\u2019re reenacting a rap video or something. As if we\\u2019re their video ho, basically. We can\\u2019t just be regular students here. We can\\u2019t just go to a party and enjoy ourselves\\u201d F. Morgan 2006. As much as we try to move away from allowing negative images to impact our lives, there are real implications that we need to contend with. Add to this the multiple stories of black women who have traveled to other parts of the world only to be approached as if they are a video vi en by the men in the countries they are visiting, and we can see how far these attitudes about women of color e tend  I also think about the hip-hop feminist warriors who are bringing wreck in the public sphere by talking back\\u2014women like the Spelman women, who wanted to initiate a dialogue with Nelly after viewing his derogatory video   \\u201cTip Drill,\\u201d only to have that attempt at dialogue stilted and to receive criticism themselves for being elitist college women looking down their noses at the women who are making an honest living in the video and the poor artist who only wants to share his art with the world. While I offer the statements above in a tongue-in-cheek manner, several interviews in which Nelly spoke about his \\u201cordeal\\u201d painted the Spelman women in this way. I am also informed by hip-hop feminist writers like Karen R. Good, who, fed-up with the whole images, representation, and objectification debates, offers her own treatise:But as of late, many of hip-hop\\u2019s children have been playing the cheapest trick: depending on undulating female, colored bodies to entice weak minds and compensate for weak rhymes. Or our bodies are used for verbal target practice. I am way past anger. Shock went the way of \\u201cBitches Ain\\u2019t Shit.\\u201d Don\\u2019t feel like being sad. I just wonder about the worth of a black girl. You know, like the difference between what happens when little white girls go missing and little black girls go missing. Or get raped. Pissed on. That type of shit. . . . That said, not one more lecture. I put my hands up. Man, if you want to swipe a credit card down the crack of a woman\\u2019s behind, or Miss, if you want to let yo ass be the machine, fine. To each his own. The culprit is not hip-hop, which is undergoing a beautiful evolution, by the way hear Mos Def\\u2019s \\u201cThe Rape Over\\u201d, it\\u2019s our reliance on the baser nature as opposed to the higher mind. Hip-hop is the thinker\\u2019s form. 2005, 29\\u201330As I think about the video vi en and her relationship to a hip-hop feminist agenda, I do so keeping the fervor and the sentiment of these very different responses to the images in mind. As the black women students at Duke remind us, the images have the power to hurt. As the negative backlash to the Spelman women shows us, when we speak out or try to initiate a dialogue, we open ourselves up for criticism. And as Karen Good reminds us, the images are not the sum and total of hip-hop and certainly not what is representative of the culture, which is in constant evolution. But they do e ist and we do need to interrogate them. And when we do, we need to add to the mi  the voices, stories, and reasons these women give for participating in the objectification. Only then will we get a more nuanced and complicated discussion of the video vi en  By adding their voices, we indeed get a discussion that highlights the gray areas that Joan Morgan writes about. These women see the videos as their entry into the world of stardom. They are aspiring actresses, models, singers, and even rappers themselves. They gladly pose in the magazines and preen in the videos, and the best and brightest of them are paid very well   to do so. Some even make up to $3,000 a day.2 These are not necessarily the poor, victimized women of old. Some of them have a critique of the business, and they recognize their role in a society in which se  sells. Video girl Tawny, interviewed by Jeanne Amber for Essence Magazine, notes: \\u201cIf video girls are being e ploited, then every female artist who is out there being se y should be blamed too. To me, it\\u2019s all bull\\u2014\\u2014\\u201d Amber 2005, 165. Former video model, BET host, and entrepreneur Melyssa Ford notes of her own career and decisions:I\\u2019m the highest-paid video girl to date. I\\u2019ve endured all the snide comments and ignorant remarks from people who presume to know me because I\\u2019m on their television screens and in the pages of their magazines. But I\\u2019m not the promiscuous twit I\\u2019m often mistaken for. I am a business-woman who has used videos to launch a multimedia career. My product is me. Besides being the lead girl in hip-hop and R&B videos, I am a se  columnist for a men\\u2019s magazine. I star in my own DVD. I\\u2019ve hosted television shows, and I\\u2019ve produced my own calendar, which I sell on the internet. My job is to sell fantasy and perfection. When the cameras go on, I detach myself and play the se y vi en who will turn a nigga out. quoted in Byrd and Solomon 2005, 219\\u201320The fact is, these women are making decisions\\u2014decisions informed by a variety of variables\\u2014to be in these videos, to pose for these magazines. While I do not pretend that their decision-making takes away from the systems of oppression surrounding them that make not making the decision to objectify themselves difficult, I do not want to ignore the agency, real or imagined, that these women have. How does their agency complicate our discussions of objectification? I don\\u2019t pretend to have the answer to this, and I don\\u2019t even want to suggest that there is one cut-and-dry answer. But I do know that as feminists, we can no longer have these conversations without including their voices and their stories. And when we add their voices and stories to the mi , they bring with them those dark and light, wrong and right mi tures that Jean Grae raps about and the subtle shades of gray that Joan Morgan writes about  The video vi en\\u2019s agency is important, and the work of visual artist Ayanah Moor adds layers to this conversation by thinking about the ways these women may be e hibiting agency even as they participate in the demeaning videos. Her collection of video shots, \\u201cSTILL,\\u201d is one e ample of the way Moor uses her art to complicate the discussion. The te t that goes along with the montage of video stills represented in the collection states:  STILL Images of women surrounding male rap stars in music videos is as common as the jewel encrusted subject matter of today\\u2019s rap lyrics. Females are seen in packs hovering around male rap stars, playing the part of enthusiastic cheerleader or die-hard groupie. Rap music videos sell not only hiphop culture, but also the very image of its women. They serve as eye candy designed to satisfy an assumed male video audience, affirming critiques of the culture as hyper masculine and misogynist. STILL is a series of photographs from contemporary rap music videos. These artworks invite a second look at the hip-hop video vi en, displaying an interest in moments unintended by music video narratives. Some stills reveal agency rather than victimization, while others provide reminders of the narrow representations of women in hip-hop. Moor 2006Moor\\u2019s \\u201cSTILL,\\u201d the hip-hop feminist discussions surrounding video models, and the video models voices and stories show, I hope, what a rich space the issues of video images and representation can be if we think about issues of agency in more complicated ways. Combining these might allow us to better interrogate the following questions. For e ample, what does it mean that hip-hop has the capability to make a woman a pseudosuperstar, sought after by magazines and video directors based on solely on how she looks? And how does this further complicate our understandings of how black women respond to things like the ideal beauty image? Does the influ  of other kinds of beauty\\u2014meaning black and women of color\\u2014into the mainstream disrupt the norm? Does it simply add yet another impossible ideal for women to yearn for that now makes women of color, particularly black women, vulnerable in ways that they haven\\u2019t been in the past? All of these questions are complicated and warrant far more space than this cursory look at possible hip-hop feminist agendas allows. But they are spaces in which hip-hop feminism can make meaningful interventions. I will now move to another space in which there are possibilities for a hip-hop feminist agenda by e amining female emcee Jean Grae  Shorty Got Love for the Game: Jean Grae,Hip-Hop, Feminism, and change Or ... Simply... I wish she were a feminist...  What would happen if we had feminist emcees moving millions toward a critique of gender that motivated them toward change? Why haven\\u2019t we had any women emcees with this kind of feminist agenda? What would happen if we could harness the power that rap music has to make people dance and make them work toward change in women\\u2019s lives? When studying   feminism in relation to hip-hop, one thing becomes abundantly clear: most women emcees are not checking for the F word. They won\\u2019t claim it. Won\\u2019t label themselves with it. Will not touch it. This is not to say that there are no feminist women rappers. However, the fact remains that as much as we champion and claim certain women rappers for their lyrics, their outreach activities, their \\u201cpositive\\u201d messages, or their \\u201cprowoman\\u201d messages, very few women rappers will go on record saying that they are feminist  Taking a page from black feminist theorist Patricia Hill Collins, who in her essay \\u201cWhat\\u2019s in a Name? Womanism, Black Feminism, and Beyond\\u201d 1999 ultimately comes to the conclusion that quibbling over what we call ourselves is less important than the work we do to evoke change, I posit that while we cannot in good conscience place the label of \\u201cfeminist\\u201d\\u2014hip-hop, thirdwave, black feminist, or womanist\\u2014on most contemporary women rappers, we can\\u2014as feminist scholars and activists\\u2014use the music they produce and the issues they raise to begin to enact change. In this regard, rising hip-hop artist Jean Grae becomes an interesting case study for hip-hop feminism even if she denounces feminism for herself: \\u201cI\\u2019m not a feminist by any means, I just want people to enjoy the music\\u201d Thomas 2004. In much of her music to date\\u2014her two CDs, Attack of the Attacking Things: The Dirty Mi es and This Week, as well as her EP, The Bootleg of the Bootleg\\u2014we can easily see the concerns of hip-hop feminists put to music  Grae\\u2019s two albums and EP have garnered critical acclaim, and just about every review I have read noted her stellar lyrics and vocal delivery but bemoaned the production and the lack of killer beats. What comes across in most interviews is the fact that she is going to make music and have a career on her own terms. We won\\u2019t see her taking off her clothes to sell records. But she is quick to stop interviewers who want to label her the Anti\\u2013Lil\\u2019 Kim, Anti\\u2013Fo y Brown, or Anti-Trina. She does not have a problem with her fellow women rappers. She has a problem with an industry that won\\u2019t allow a fullness of black womanhood to be represented. She notes: \\u201cYou know what, that\\u2019s not me. That\\u2019s not how I live. And that\\u2019s not how I do. But there are females that do. I think it\\u2019s messed up that there is not an opportunity for someone who is not doing that to have an equal chance. And that is the problem. It\\u2019s like there has to be some choice . . . have some other shit. Balance it all out. Apparently for some odd reason, that is not allowed\\u201d Bloom 2004. She knows what she is willing to do and she knows what she has to offer: \\u201cI want to break the formula, and make history for myself. I want people to know I\\u2019m a skilled writer and lyricist that isn\\u2019t afraid to be honest. I\\u2019m stubborn. I refuse to change myself   for a machine\\u201d Dyer 2004. I have to admit, when it comes to hip-hop, I am all about the lyrics. The beat is important, yes\\u2014couldn\\u2019t be a true hip-hop head and not acknowledge that. But the beat is not going to make me buy the record. In fact, I\\u2019m much more e cited when the beat takes me back to the essence, the simple boom bap. So, the reviews that bemoaned the lack of cutting-edge production and beats on Jean Grae\\u2019s CDs didn\\u2019t faze me. Her lyrics blew me away. Her lyrics, style, and delivery are like one part Jigga, two parts Nas, a healthy dose of gender consciousness, race consciousness, and, lo and behold, a pinch of a global awareness for good measure  On her first album, Attack of the Attacking Things, Jean Grae critiques the se ism in hip-hop. In the song \\u201cKnock\\u201d she raps, \\u201cAsk me bastard if I\\u2019m signed / I rhyme sick / but niggas is quick to turn they back on spitters with clits / Hit em with this, and ridiculous phrase flow that e it my lips / Hey yo, I mean my face, though / they still want chicks with tits and ass out / my respect is worth more than your advance cash-out.\\u201d In the song \\u201cWhat Would I Do?\\u201d she raps: \\u201cI\\u2019m Jean Grae, honorable team player for years / Emceeing on the low, in videos devoid of the hoes / For sho\\u2019 it\\u2019s crunch time / I\\u2019m the one they sent to piss your label off / they won\\u2019t fuck with me unless I\\u2019m parading and taking it off.\\u201d She is very conscious of the se ism in the music industry and the e ploitation of women in particular. And her lyrics and her interviews show that she is raging against that machine  Perhaps what is most worthy of mention is the way that the song \\u201cWhat Would I Do?\\u201d aims to inspire change. The  asks: \\u201cWhat, what, what would I do? / If like my people said, I left it to you. / Tell me what, what, what would I do. / If I didn\\u2019t try a verse, if I didn\\u2019t rhyme. / Tell me what, what, what would I do. / If I just hated and did nothing to change it\\u201d The  makes the listeners question themselves as well. For all of us complaining about the status of hip-hop, what are we doing to change it? Listening to Attack of the Attacking Things is almost like reading Joan Morgan\\u2019s When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost. Although the outright feminist agenda is missing from Jean Grae\\u2019s album, the themes that come out in Morgan\\u2019s book about the need for change and the vulnerability of wanting to be loved are all there  Perhaps the most poignant representation of a hip-hop feminist state of mind and potential agenda comes across in the song \\u201cP.S.\\u201d from Grae\\u2019s latest CD, This Week. The song is a series of e-mails, which are basically apologies to people she has wronged in the past, a friend she betrayed, a lover she   cheated on, and herself. The song calls to mind the hip-hop feminist need to question our complicity in our oppression. She questions it and owns it. In the last  she raps:Dear Jean I see you\\u2019re doing big things Congratulations, hey I even saw that big ring Who would of thunk it huh? LOL You even seem content I notice that you\\u2019re more focused Drinking less as well Anyways it\\u2019s been too many months having henny days I think it\\u2019s plenty brave, plus you get your pennies saved up And say what?!? Second album? Whatever happened to the thought of ending rapping? Still living in Manhattan? Sidetracking note, just on the low All apologies, I used to hate your fucking guts Please pardon me, tried to kill you more than once I\\u2019ve acted horribly, and all my pessimism towards your life Still bothers me But you\\u2019re a big girl now You\\u2019ve fought and made it through Best of luck homie And everything I say is true XOXO Space Smiley Face dot dot dot Comma Much Love, youThe fact that the speaker in this rap is writing this particular e-mail to her \\u201cself\\u201d is telling; it brings to mind many questions about how young black women internalize the negative influences bombarding them. Hip-hop feminist writings have dealt with some of these issues. What has been criticized as a self-absorption and an e cessive focus on the individual in most hiphop feminist writings is really a genuine concern and a search for meaning, particularly what it means to be a young woman in often dangerous urban environments; what it means to be a woman who participates in and loves a culture that doesn\\u2019t always love you; and how you deal with it when some of the hatred aimed at you becomes internalized and affects how you treat others and how you feel about yourself. Jean Grae\\u2019s \\u201cP.S.\\u201d is all of those hip-hop feminist questions and issues put to music. And in a world where young black women grapple with so many images that objectify and se ualize them, such artistry is needed. I move now to a discussion of one of the most   problematic images that young women who listen to contemporary hip-hop face: the ride-or-die chick Shorty Wanna Ride? Ride or Die Chicks and Real Black GirlsBut got a women that ain\\u2019t afraid To tuck the toast in the escalade Pop on niggas that showin me shade But only for the Rule \\u2019cause that\\u2019s my baby Got me a down ass bitch with red hair, that don\\u2019t care Blazed by the shots and flares Girl c\\u2019mon, follow me, and bust back at police Conceal ya heat -- Ja Rule, \\u201cDown Ass Bitch\\u201dShorty, you ridin\\u2019 with me? Stic tell \\u2019em bought them RBGs I like \\u2019em real trill Gold in the grill Cold as Pam Grier swoll in the rear Hard, smart, strong in the heart Se y thong when we alone in the dark Dark skin, red bone, slim in the waist Them legs so long Queen earth, jean skirt, head wrapped up Pimping them con And she down for the dirt For better or for worse Got my gun in her purse In case a nigga get searched She got a mind like Assata A body like Trina A heart like my momma Nigga tell me have you seen her? -- Dead Prez, \\u201cReal Black Girl Revolutionary Love\\u201dFinding a way to combine feminism and hip-hop in politically meaningful ways is one of the premier goals of hip-hop feminism. This is not easy work. The negative lyrics of most contemporary hip-hop are enough to make even the most die-hard hip-hop feminist contemplate giving up the music and the culture. Articles by dream hampton 2001 and Eisa Nefertari Ulen and Tara Roberts 2000 both speak volumes about the frustration of being a hip-hop head who is also a feminist.    The fastest-growing prison population statistically in this country is black women. They are going to jail largely because of their relationships with men who are involved with criminal activities. They are going to jail for things like smuggling drugs; they are women like Kemba Smith, who simply fell in love with the wrong man and was too afraid to leave. As Smith recounts, \\u201cAt age 24, without so much as a parking ticket on my record, I was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison\\u2014without parole. Technically, I was convicted of conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine, but I contend that I went to jail for dating a drug dealer.\\u201d She was finally pardoned as a last minute act of President Clinton, but she still feels that justice was not served. She notes, \\u201cYou\\u2019d think I\\u2019d have been doing cartwheels when I was released. Truthfully, my feelings were in conflict. It was tough to leave behind the incredible women I met in prison\\u2014especially since many of them were victims of the same laws that put me away\\u201d Booth 2001, 86. The incarceration rate for black women continues to grow because of the messages young women are getting from the videos. Messages from contemporary rap lyrics about being a \\u201cdown ass chick\\u201d are everywhere, and they are not just coming from men. Women rappers also rap about the illegal things they would do for their men  In my book Pough 2004, I critiqued the image of the ride-or-die chick as it is represented in hip-hop, the girl willing to do whatever she can for her man, a girl that the lyrics of Ja Rule\\u2019s \\u201cDown Ass Chick\\u201d call to mind. I urged black feminists in particular to look at these representations as a threat to young black womanhood and to find ways to have conversations with young women and reach out to them before we lose an entire generation. The situation was and still is that dire for me. However, I\\u2019d like to complicate things just a little by thinking about what I see as another version, albeit a revolutionary version, of the down ass chick. The recent revolutionary but gangsta messages from rap group Dead Prez have also included some interesting messages for what they call Real Black Girls\\u2014girls who are \\u201cdown for the dirt, / for better or for worse, / got my gun in a purse / in case a nigga get searched.\\u201d  Given the hip-hop feminist fondness for all things \\u201970s and revolutionary, it is easy to see how a RBG Real Black Girl/Revolutionary but Gangsta image is more appealing than a Down Ass Chick. The reggae beat of the song and the reggae chant of the first stanza calls to mind those Black Panther sisters we see in all the footage of that time but never hear about. Or the revolutionary sisters who are still in prison as political prisoners for their acts against the establishment but whose names we have yet to learn, let alone start a Free fill in the blank Movement for.    Now, I\\u2019m not going to argue that down ass chicks and real black girls are problematic for the same reasons. That\\u2019s not the point of the comparison. The point of the comparison is to look at the ways in which a mentality of being down for whatever\\u2014even when that whatever is revolution\\u2014can add to the growing black women prison rate. The point is also to complicate our thinking about hip-hop in ways that stop us from creating dichotomies that place rappers like Ja Rule in one category labeled commercial, negative, and therefore bad, and rappers like Dead Prez and others in another pile labeled conscious, underground, revolutionary, and therefore good. The point isn\\u2019t to single out Dead Prez, because they do build on a legacy of the Black Power Movement that had its own gender issues to work out. Even though one would hope that in the twenty-first century conscious rappers would not be replicating those dated and retrograde ideas in such problematic ways. And even though I have no problem with the concept of doing what we have to do for the revolution, per se, I have to ask, if we are talking about a revolution, then what is my role in it, brother? Is a woman\\u2019s role in the revolution still pussy power and prone and now I have to conceal your weapon to boot? All of that aside, my point in using Dead Prez\\u2019s \\u201cReal Black Girl\\u2019s Revolutionary Love\\u201d as an e ample is simply to say that if we are pushing hip-hop feminism forward as a movement concerned with creating change in the culture and eventually change in the world, we cannot be one-sided with our critiques. Everyone gets called out if they need to be called out. Thinking about \\u201cReal Black Girls\\u201d as a derivative of the \\u201cDown Ass Chick\\u201d is one area that we could e am that would allow us to break apart some of the false dichotomies between conscious and commercial hip-hop  In her novel Picture Me Rollin\\u2019 2005, Black Artemis tells the tale of a young woman who has been released from jail on a mandatory gun possession charge. The protagonist, Esperanza, was dating a street entrepreneur who dabbled in armed robbery when she got caught in the getaway vehicle with a gun that he gave her. She was the only one out of the crew to serve time, mainly as a lesson because she refused to testify\\u2014to snitch\\u2014against the guys. When the novel opens, Esperanza is being released from jail, and throughout the novel she grapples with several things. The first is \\u201cThug Life,\\u201d an obsession with rapper 2Pac Shakur that is so delusional she thinks that the rapper is still alive and chilling in Cuba with Assata Shakur. The second is her newfound knowledge of women of color feminism, thanks to her older sister\\u2019s community college course books. And the third is her old life as a drug dealer and generic ride-or-die chick for her drug dealer boyfriend Jesus. Esperanza   tries throughout the novel to make a better life for herself, and Black Artemis does an e cellent job of showing another side\\u2014a female side\\u2014of growing up in the urban environments and landscapes made famous by hip-hop  The character Esperanza offers some insight that we all need to consider as we grapple with and complicate the down ass chick. In the prologue to the novel, Esperanza is getting ready to be released from prison and is having a talk with fellow prisoner and roommate Isoke, a political prisoner jailed for her activity with the Black Liberation movement. Isoke is trying to get Esperanza to move beyond an embrace of Tupac\\u2019s \\u201cThug Life\\u201d in order to join the larger struggle. Isoke also works in the prison library, so she has given Esperanza a lot of things to read. At this point, however, if it isn\\u2019t related to 2Pac, Esperanza is not really interested in reading it. When Isoke flat-out asks her if she is going to be a thug or a revolutionary the older political prisoner lectures to Esperanza: \\u201cBecause I\\u2019m afraid that brother 2Pac was wrong. Thug Life is not the new Black Power. It makes no sense to rage against the machine without purpose or principle. You cannot be both a gangsta and a soldier, Esperanza, so you must choose.\\u201d In response to this, Esperanza sighs and thinks \\u201cneither \\u2019cause either way I\\u2019ll end up back in this muthafucka or dead.\\u201d When Esperanza speaks, she responds, \\u201cAll I know is that I am never coming back here\\u201d Artemis 2005, 2. Esperanza\\u2019s words bring the connection between the lyrics of Ja Rule\\u2019s \\u201cDown Ass Chick\\u201d and Dead Prez\\u2019s \\u201cReal Black Girls\\u201d home in powerful ways. We can see that when it comes down to it, there really isn\\u2019t that much difference between the oppression and the limitations placed on women; that patriarchy in criminal circles is not better or worse than patriarchy in revolutionary circles; that patriarchy in gangsta rap is no worse or better than patriarchy in conscious rap  What the novel and the lyrics highlight to me is a real need for hip-hop feminism to be engaged with all aspects of black girls\\u2019 lives\\u2014we don\\u2019t want to be accused of being irrelevant to young black women in the ways that some of us have categorized academic black feminism. It makes no sense to pick and choose images and the artists who create the images and lyrics by deeming some negative and some positive, all the while creating false dichotomies. The issues and the artists are much more complicated than these simplistic readings allow. Rappers like 2Pac Shakur, Dead Prez, Common, Mos Def, and others are nothing if not complicated and sometimes conflicted young men. A cursory look at their work shows us that. Hip-hop feminism needs to be bolder in its critiques, even if it means calling out the so-called good guys every once and a while.    Shorty Wrote this Book Yo!: Hip-hop and Feminism, Is it Fiction?  In her 2001 novel, The Haunting of Hip-Hop, author, lecturer, and scholar Bertice Berry tells the chilling tale of a Harlem brownstone haunted by souls tortured due to U.S. racism and oppression. One of the souls, a former enslaved African, has a message for the hip-hop generation: \\u201cWe gave the drum back to your generation in the form of rap, but it\\u2019s being used to send the wrong message\\u201d Berry 2001. The novel tells the story of rap producer Harry \\u201cFreedom\\u201d Hudson and his lawyer Ava Vercher  If Freedom represents hip-hop in the novel, then Ava represents the consciousness that echoes in hip-hop\\u2019s ear and tries to keep it on a righteous path. Ava Vercher is a new-age Afrocentric womanist with uplift tendencies. Freedom is a producer who makes two kinds of music: one is the kind of commercial music record companies want and the other is \\u201cmusic that no major record label would ever release because it was filled with the messages of love he longed for and the revolution he dreamed of starting\\u201d Berry 2001, 16. You see that the ghost of the enslaved African has been haunting Freedom ever since he was a child, and he hopes to influence Freedom to do the right thing with the drum before it is too late  I\\u2019ve found the most compelling representations of hip-hop feminist representations in hip-hop literature. This is not to say that we should discount the music or the nonfiction writings of hip-hop feminists but simply to offer other spaces within hip-hop culture in which people are trying to imagine a better way. I closed Check It While I Wreck It with the call for us all to imagine a better way to use the culture of hip-hop to enact change. I believe that some women writers of popular fiction have begun to do just that  In the \\u201cReader\\u2019s Guide: A Conversation with Black Artemis\\u201d at the end of her first novel E plicit Content, Black Artemis defines hip-hop fiction as fiction \\u201cabout hip-hop as a subculture, as something that gives people voice and their lives meaning.\\u201d For her, \\u201chip-hop is a form of cultural power and whether that power is a force for progress or destruction depends on how people use it, whether you use it on the street or in the studio, for fun or for profit, to build or destroy\\u201d 2004, 338. Of the recent trend to call urban fiction hip-hop fiction, she notes:I think that street life should be referred to as street life fiction, period, and that the term \\u201chip-hop fiction\\u201d should be reserved for novels that are about hip-hop. Eventually, there\\u2019ll be some works that can be referred to as both, but something that has nothing to do with hip-hop subculture should not   be referred to as hip-hop fiction, especially if it perpetuates the myth that hip-hop is all about violence, drugs, misogyny, etc. These phenomena are not the sum total of hip-hop, and hip-hop is not the only subculture in which those elements e ist so it is wrong to treat them as if they are one and the same. 2004, 339Her distinction has caused me to rethink many of my earlier definitions about what constitutes hip-hop fiction and cinema. The distinction is necessary and important for those of us looking for ways to more fully use the youth culture to enact change. And it does not rely on a dichotomy of positive and negative, conscious and commercial. The work simply has to be about one of the elements of hip-hop culture to be classified as such  Black Artemis\\u2019s E plicit Content documents the story of two women rappers, one black and one Latina. The novel e plores what it is like to be a female with rapping skills trying to gain recognition in the music industry. It follows the women into the world of hip-hop and e amines their hopes and dreams. It\\u2019s also a novel about female friendship, with just enough drama to keep the average hip-hop head focused and interested. The two women are a rap duo to rival all rap duos until a gangsta rap label comes between them. Of her work Black Artemis notes, \\u201cin these times when hip-hop is often used as a cultural weapon of destruction, my mission as a hip-hop artist and activist is to tell stories that relay the power of hip-hop as a tool of transformative e pression\\u201d 2004, 340. The activist in her comes across in her fiction. It is fiction with a mission; in the tradition of the poets and playwrights of the Black Arts Movement who created art for people\\u2019s sake, Black Artemis\\u2019s art has an activist goal and agenda in mind  Another writer who has political threads in her work is L. A. Banks. Her Vampire Huntress Legends focus on the life of spoken word artist and vampire huntress, Damali Richards. She is the Neturu, which means God\\u2019s divine power latent within humans. She is the only Neturu to span two millennia. Damali uses her art\\u2014her spoken word music\\u2014to bring the light. Her lyrics are about hope in a time of hopelessness. And her band is also her vampire hunting crew. When I asked Banks why she decided to write horror and focus on vampires, she replied: \\u201cI wrote this series because I\\u2019m a mother living in the urban environment\\u2014and horror, because I have been horrified by what I see on the nightly news, and hear on the trolleys and subways, and by what I read in the newspapers. Vampires\\u2014because they suck blood, in a metaphor, they suck the life-blood out of the community as predators, and really have no sense of mortality or moral compass. I   wanted to create a cautionary tale, but one that also delved into the social, economic, and political infrastructure within our own society that creates predators\\u201d Pough 2005, 168. Each of the novels in the series uses art to highlight the pitfalls of e cessive materialism. Each of the novels work as metaphors for the age-old fight between good and evil. However, by making Damali a young spoken word artist, Banks is making a huge statement about the power at hand for young women, the power to change the world. And as for hip-hop, she hasn\\u2019t given up hope. Banks notes, \\u201cI see plenty of room for Hip-hop as an awesome catalyst, and I\\u2019m not so ready to give up on all Hip-hop artists, their messages, or their lyrics. I think what has happened, as metaphorically alluded to in the novels, is that vampires have infiltrated the genre of music, have co-opted the culture, and have twisted it. But there are still some very young, savvy, ready-to-stand-for-their-beliefs young folk out there. . . . that\\u2019s the message, that\\u2019s my hope. . . . guess it\\u2019s really my prayer\\u201d Pough 2005, 171. Like Black Artemis, L. A. Banks has a mission in her art, and that mission is in line with many of the goals that hip-hop feminists have set out. Their novels offer hope and a spark for hiphop culture, at least in terms of having a political mission aimed at change. Race, class, se , gender, and the intersections of these are present in this new fiction in startling, surprising, and uplifting ways. Writers like L. A. Banks and Black Artemis, rappers like Jean Grae, and the hip-hop feminists that I have mentioned here can in varying degrees be seen as pushing the hip-hop feminist agenda forward. They represent\\u2014along with the video vi ens and the women hip-hop heads who buy the music and support the culture\\u2014a small sampling of women in contemporary hip-hop culture. Together their stories offer versions of the truth that Joan Morgan suggests we could achieve. Together they also give us a glimpse at the possibility for change and a sign that hip-hop feminism just might be on the right path to what it is going to be at last. And then we might be a little less concerned with \\u201cwhat it do\\u201d because we would be so awed by all that the movement has done  Endnotes  1. I realize that the word \\u201cshorty\\u201d as a term that is often used to refer to women in hiphop culture and rap music is problematic. Although not as derogatory as some other terms, such as \\u201cchickenheads,\\u201d \\u201cbitch,\\u201d \\u201cho,\\u201d and so forth, it is still a term that more often than not objectifies women. It is also a term in hip-hop culture that refers to younger people, often children. Because \\u201cshorty\\u201d is used within the culture to refer to women and children,   it can be argued that the term therefore infantilizes women; thus, it is not a term I use lightly. I use \\u201cshorty\\u201d throughout this essay because of its multiple meanings, because it showcases just how fraught the relationship between hip-hop and feminism is. And I also use it because it calls forth the generational issues between hip-hop feminists and older black feminism. In a sense, hip-hop feminists are the shorties, the ne t generation of feminists on the \\u201ccome up\\u201d ready to continue the legacy of black women\\u2019s intellectual traditions and activism  2. Most of my information about the dreams and aspirations of video models and how much they make comes from a survey of the interviews and photo spreads I\\u2019ve read of in the Source Magazine\\u2019s monthly \\u201cDime Piece\\u201d section and XXL\\u2019s monthly \\u201cEye Candy\\u201d section. Each month these magazines pick a video girl to highlight. And while most of the \\u201ccoverage\\u201d is the photo shoot of the scantly-clad woman, there is usually a two- to three-page write-up and interview of each girl. And it is in these limited spaces that we get their voices, hopes, and dreams  References  Amber, Jeannine. \\u201cDirty Dancing,\\u201d Essence Magazine, March 2005, 162\\u201366, 203  Artemis, Black.

I don\\\\'t know what to say other than that. This whole project, whether you look at it as a mi tape or an album\\u2014to me\\u2014it\\\\'s the beginning of my life\\\\'s work. Literally. Some of the first few rhymes and personal musical compositions I ever wrote is on this very project. Stuff on here dates back to random scribbles on random class journal pages and napkins from my life in just 8th grade.    - \\\"Kool-Aid and Frozen Pizza\\\" and \\\"What\\\\'s the 411/The Ride\\\" were my first two raps of 2012. - \\\"I Have to Go\\\", \\\"Why You Forcing Me\\\" and \\\"I\\\\'m Alive Again\\\" were among my first few original music and lyric compositions of that same year.    And in just that year alone, I frequently was \\\\'creating\\\\'. Everyday before I had a laptop or a phone I basically had notebooks and pads on pads of new material and out of that\\u2014you actually have finally gotten the chance to hear a great amount of it. I\\\\'ve been waiting a long time for that. For this. Honest. And that applies to every song on here. From the simple things I began drafting my freshman year at LaGuardia \\\"So Mellow\\\", \\\"I. A Whole New World\\\", to the more comple  ideas branching from my complicated and isolated sophomore year \\\"Two Truths and a Lie\\\", \\\"Oncheezied\\\", this project for me is truly Magnificent, not just in content, but as an accomplishment, in all aspects of the word.    ...but this is surreal...    For some people it might be something of vanity that makes them continue in this field, or it bringing in the money that keeps them afloat, or for others it may just be the simplicity that it sometimes brings to your life. Specifically for me, I think it\\\\'s the beauty of something I created actually coming to life. E cept this time, it\\\\'s not leading to the Pygmalion fault, it\\\\'s leading to happiness. Sitting here listening to this stuff and playing it back, it\\\\'s actually starting to sound the way I imagined it not so many years ago. That\\\\'s inconceivable magic to me. Lovely magic. The type of magic that makes my grandparents smile at finally hearing their only son singing and loving music the way he used to\\u2014and it\\\\'s that same smile that brightens their lives as they see their grandson doing what he\\\\'s always wanted. The type of magic that makes me not feel alone but connected to more positive and beautiful things in life, more beautiful people. The type of magic that makes it clear anything is possible, even if it isn\\\\'t necessarily obvious or evident. But, it\\\\'s bittersweet just the same because this isn\\\\'t it. It\\\\'s not the end. I\\\\'d like to be able to sit on this for a while and just listen with you. It\\\\'s changed me, just in the way I hope it changes you. But I can\\\\'t, I have to keep working. There\\\\'s so much more I have to finish now that I don\\\\'t think\\u2014but I know is possible.  So I\\\\'d like to start by saying this is not your average mi tape. This is my mi tape. This is something different. Nothing on here is really going to sound like it\\\\'s being DJ\\\\'d and that\\\\'s not the point if it were. It\\\\'s the fact that despite what my father, Kedar and Mike have all told me throughout this phase of my life and how I ever felt about it\\u2014they\\\\'re starting to sound right. This isn\\\\'t a mi tape.    ...it\\\\'s more of an album...    A conceptual one on the objects and objectives of my desires, the inner workings of my puerile mind\\u2014that ironically refuses to be subject to mediocracy. And to those reading this, to those who I\\\\'ve let in\\u2014especially those who I\\\\'ve truly collaborated with on and during the time of recording this tape\\u2014I preach the same e act thing to you. To even those who don\\\\'t enjoy this work of mine or aren\\\\'t reading this, are reading this but don\\\\'t feel it or perhaps may never read it, I still say the same. For the most part, I don\\\\'t necessarily mind if you do not enjoy this. But I know I did and for now, I\\\\'ll try my best to make that suffice and convince you I\\\\'m worthy of your hearts ne t time around.   Now for the thank you\\\\'s...  Jharrel Jerome you\\\\'re first up. From the bottom of my heart, thank you so very much for the opportunity that you gave me in the first place. \\\"Big Spender\\\", \\\"Rap Battle Skit 1\\\",  but then again all of F.M.L opened doors for me. Not only did you show me that literally someone my age could figure out a way to get a real studio and scrummage together some sort of money to get through an entire year of recording a project\\u2014but you gave me the template of what I believe helped me format this tape. And it was a template I had to both look up to and defeat at the same time. You making that both difficult and enjoyable for me has made me respect you more than just as an artist or as one of the many profusely heartwarming and talented creatures that walk this Earth, but as a man, and I will always look to you as that and nothing less. You\\\\'re going to be an undoubtedly favorited addition to this label. All the best wishes to you and your family, as well as to your great success at Ithaca.    To the members of True Artists. I\\\\'ll hit you all one by one in a moment, but I\\\\'d like to start by saying you were the first part of the Magnificent family and my LaGuardia family. And I will never forget any of you for that. We\\\\'ve kept each other intact in more ways than I bet any of us realize. We\\\\'re changing the game with the stuff we do\\u2014and we know that. It\\\\'s really too late to try and stray from it even if you wanted to. If anything happened to any of ya\\\\'ll, I\\\\'d lose it and I\\\\'m glad we\\\\'ve all stayed healthy and proud regardless of any of the traumas or stress in our lives. That\\\\'s never negatively affected our art\\u2014but in some ways it\\\\'s empowered it. Thus, why we\\\\'re \\\"true artists\\\". I know we hated the name starting out, but I\\\\'m glad it\\\\'s grown on us. I\\\\'ll always have your backs when something ever goes askew and you can count on me to be the one dumping the gatorade on each of you when we reach the end of the road.  Let\\\\'s start with you Vito\\u2014mister Travis Raeburn. I\\\\'ve known you since middle school well, more like known of you then and officially gotten to know you and consider you a close friend of mine during our years at LaGuardia. I trust you with all my heart man. We had a conversation once about our futures. Inconsistencies. Me about Steph, you about the things you haven\\\\'t e perienced. I don\\\\'t e actly remember in what conte t, but I remember saying \\\"if we make it.\\\" You looked at me like I was crazy and stopped us from walking to where we had to go. You looked at me and set me straight. You told me \\\"when we make it.\\\" Forever since that moment, I\\\\'ve held that thought close. Especially since it was similar to a parallel my father often made. God said \\\"let there be light\\\", and there simply was. Nothing less. By continuing to think that way, we will be there in seconds. Best believe.  Marquise Naipaul. It\\\\'s funny how your name shortened is like the word \\\"mark\\\", and you\\\\'re an illustrator. We\\\\'ve had some great times man. You\\\\'re one of the most level-headed, humbled young men I\\\\'ve gotten to know. You do what you do with ease. And your strategy out of everyone in our crew has easily allowed us to never feel restrained by an issue. To Marq, usually we can just so quickly bypass it, because your wisdom is plainly, anything is possible. If one thing doesn\\\\'t work with you, you just go with it. Maybe it wasn\\\\'t meant to happen, if it is, it\\\\'ll happen eventually. Well, it\\\\'s happening now. I think it really is. And I\\\\'m glad we got front row seats.  Nathaniel Singh, I\\\\'ve been praying for you man. As upset as I am that you had to leave LaG and that you were so sick all those months, I\\\\'m glad you\\\\'re finally getting back on your feet. If you listened to the tape, you probably noticed there\\\\'s an unfinished version of \\\"Make Believe\\\", and that\\\\'s because we still gotta get together and do it. We need you Tanny. Our squad can\\\\'t survive without you. You\\\\'re such a humorous, friendly guy man. I\\\\'m so sorry for the times you were going through during your absence. I know the world gets heavy on us sometimes and we\\\\'d just prefer to drop the ball, but honestly man I love you to death. You gotta keep your head up and keep killing them with these hits. When we do finish \\\"Make Believe\\\"\\u2014well, let\\\\'s just say we won\\\\'t be able to live normal lives anymore. We\\\\'re not normal people Nate. None of us are. Nobody on this tape is normal and that\\\\'s the genius of it. We\\\\'re all a little bit insane man and that\\\\'s the thing that makes me and you click. Hell, half the time we\\\\'re talking to each other people feel like we\\\\'re speaking a different language. And it\\\\'s \\\\'cuz we are. Sincere gratitude to your parents, your brothers and much love to you and your boy Ceddy. P.S. I heard about the possible Def Jam signing man. God\\\\'s pulling up on the other side huh? How green is it over there? Peace man. Stay up.    Houston Arriaga, I gave you that \\\"Star\\\" name and it fits well. I got to know you pretty well as the release of this whole thing approached. I\\\\'m sorry we didn\\\\'t get together sooner and that we still haven\\\\'t finished \\\"Rescue\\\", but best believe when we do, we\\\\'re gonna sit back and chill. Your presence is incredible. You\\\\'re a very good spirit to keep around when times get tough. I appreciate that. You\\\\'re strength precedes you man and I look up to you for that. Stay up brother.    Kar\\\\'mel A. W. Smalls, I hope you like what I did with \\\"Two Truths and a Lie\\\". I kind of had to pull a full throttle on it since we weren\\\\'t able to meet up and work on it the way I wanted and planned to. But I hope I still did it justice in your opinion. You\\\\'ve showed me so much of your work man and truthfully I can\\\\'t wait to see you blossom. Not just in music but with your swift dance and harmonious vocal talents. That no one has yet to hear. You, as well as Jharrel, are two people I\\\\'m definitely planning on working with day after day after day. Your energies are beyond living\\u2014they\\\\'re angelic. When we meet again we\\\\'re both gonna be in the booth together. In the meantime, let\\\\'s keep on growing.    Alprentice Davis. We did it. We\\\\'re finally moving forward. I used to talk about this all the time and we\\\\'re finally in the studio doing everything I said we would. You got to be on a mi tape finally, you have a single of your own and aside that we\\\\'re finally creating this label. I can\\\\'t wait until you can meet up with Trav, Nate, Marq and Slim so we can all just change the world with this man. We\\\\'ve known each other since we were in diapers practically. We\\\\'ve got in trouble with each other. We\\\\'ve written stories together. And though you may not be up here in NY as much anymore, best believe that whenever you are it\\\\'s like you were never gone. We never got to graduate on the same stage, but Kindergarten was our practice step, for this. I don\\\\'t know what my life would be like if I never met you. But, I\\\\'m glad I got to. We need to stick together\\u2014we\\\\'re the same blood\\u2014we\\\\'re the same kids. We\\\\'re brothers, and brothers don\\\\'t abandon each other. Best buds for life.  Mike Martial, my ingenious engineer and mi er. You gave the sometimes rather blurry sounds of my conscience, clarity. You heard things for this project I never imagined. And as a producer and rapper yourself, you were able to give a tone to the project that added to the message in a greater manner than I ever originally was conveying on each track. Some of them didn\\\\'t even sit well with me at first, but as I listened, things just got better and better. I\\\\'m glad that my father and I met you. Your vigor changed this project into an unbelievable dream. Thank you for all your effort and constant work. Anything I ever do will always be brought to you.  Kester \\\"Kedar\\\" Lynch for your wise and always positive words for the project. You believed in it the moment I came to your door step and I\\\\'m glad you were able to come along for the ride. Thank you for your time and effort on this project. You made sure you came to every Sunday session you could no matter what the circumstances. I\\\\'ll never forget after financing us with all the Chinese food orders and your famous codfish delectable sandwiches\\u2014that you cooked a full meal for us and brought it all the way from Queens out to Brooklyn. That\\\\'s commitment and that\\\\'s the love you brought to us and shared with us every week. This project would have been so incredibly different without you. Your being brought such a family-like element to the studio. It didn\\\\'t matter what was being recorded, there was never any judgement. There was just full honesty and continuous encouragement to make every track the very best it could be. You added to the most intricate details that made this whole thing up and with that I will forever be in your debt. I hope you will be able to return for that role in all my other ventures as time progresses. Peace, love and blessings my brother.    To Aja Eden Adam. We\\\\'ve been through a lot. Sometimes more than I deserved. Sometimes more than you needed to deal with. But I\\\\'m glad regardless of our struggles, we\\\\'ve stayed friends. Your eye as a photographer has always interested me. Ever since I met you and knew you had that talent, I think I always knew I wanted you to photograph something valuable for me. I didn\\\\'t know how important that photograph would be, but it turns out it was my first musical effort. I\\\\'m glad you were able to be apart of this as well as help me for the filming of 14 St. I hope to work with you again in the same field or on maybe even something greater. Love you.    Stephanie Rios. \\\"Hey. Hello. Hi.\\\" We used to greet in Crayola with \\\"Yellows!\\\" and \\\"Greens!\\\" but officially, those latter three words are the three ways I\\\\'ve found I can\\\\'t contact you. I haven\\\\'t reached out to you in the longest and I guess that\\\\'s because maybe I\\\\'ve been working on this or I\\\\'ve been seeing things differently. I\\\\'m glad everything is going great for you where you are. And I hope when you see how much you\\u2014or rather the concept of you\\u2014is actually involved in this project, you don\\\\'t take it the wrong way. Hopefully you see it the same way you saw \\\"The Tale\\\", because simply, that\\\\'s what it is. You\\\\'ve been someone I have always made sure I could keep an arm out to and also something I could keep a handle on. I shouldn\\\\'t do that, I shouldn\\\\'t have done that, but I do\\u2014I won\\\\'t anymore really. There\\\\'s a lot on here that I always tried to say to you through a te t or a voice message, but maybe hearing it like this resonates purer and more clearly. We may never meet in person but at least we\\\\'ll know what each other\\\\'s voices sound like. You know? You\\\\'re a beautiful Virgo angel whose intelligent, loving, motherly spirit was handcrafted by God himself. You are you. No one else. I\\\\'m glad about that. I don\\\\'t think I would have wanted to ever meet another Stephanie Rios. Hopefully you\\\\'ll always remember that regardless of if I say so or he says so or someone else does. Hopefully even when people try to say otherwise, you\\\\'ll know. Just know. Don\\\\'t think about anything else but that. Doing you is what keeps you\\u2014I don\\\\'t know\\u2014you. And I like that. You truly are the compass of this tape and the matriarch of it\\\\'s beauty. You are the definition of this tape. You are Magnificent.  Me: \\\"What do you want to be when you grow up Steph?\\\" You: \\\"Happy.\\\"  I agree with you. I mean what else can we be right? We\\\\'ll talk when we talk. Much love from your boy, Rod.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------This tape was for your discretion. Anyone mentioned on this project in passing or blatantly was either used fictitiously or metaphorically for the sole purpose of relaying a message. To those brought up, I thank you for the ways that you impacted my life\\u2014whether that be positively, negatively or perhaps both. You\\\\'ve made up who I am today\\u2014which though in some ways isn\\\\'t satisfying\\u2014is also better than the boy I was yesterday...----------------------------------------------------------------------  To the many others involved with this project:  Lorem Vercetti, I never was able to reach you but I wanted to pay my respects to your work man. There were a couple KAFP instrumentals that I sorted through and could\\\\'ve taken use of, but yours was the most appealing to me.  Also to Jarion Ale ander, who alongside being one of the very first producers I\\\\'ve ever worked with on our promotional, \\\"The Tale\\\", did an amazing reproduction for Jharrel and I on \\\"2 On\\\". That rework on the second half of that song always jolts me into  spection.  Giovanna Armstrong, I was first  duced to your work by my friend Kar\\\\'mel. Holy hell, I love your ear for samples and \\\"Oncheezied\\\" was to date one of the greatest beats I had heard on your SoundCloud. I\\\\'m glad I was able to get you on this project. Don\\\\'t  even worry about it, we\\\\'re gonna work together again in the future. Bet on it.  Drew Williams, we weren\\\\'t in contact very long, but from what I gained from you\\u2014I learned how hungry you are to do art and rise above, satisfying your ambitions. In that way, we are very similar. I hope you enjoyed what I did for your rework of \\\"What\\\\'s the 411\\\" as well as my production alongside it. Truly loved the collaboration\\u2014this song will always be a favorite of mine.  DJ Abomination, we\\\\'ve contacted each other restlessly throughout the duration of this project. You\\\\'re actually one of the first few producers I was interested in working with, as well as the first one I reached out to. Hope you loved the outcome of \\\"Defender of the Castle\\\", as well as Magnificent in general. It was fun tackling that instrumental as well as coming up with the right way to place it into the project\\\\'s narrative. May the odds forever be in your favor man, you deserve it.  Ionut Olteanu, I\\\\'ve fell in love with so many of your beats. Deeply sorry for the loss of your previous channel. I appreciate you allowed me to use your work for \\\"Osiris\\\" and even further, I\\\\'m grateful that you allowed me that opportunity before your channel closed down. So much of your work hits hard and I can\\\\'t wait to hear where you go in the future.  And finally, A-Rayz Music. You were the final source I contacted on this project. After hearing some of your production through a schoolmate of mine, I had to actually speak to you. Your work on \\\"Carpe Diem\\\" was able to free me from a long amount of writers block I had while working on Magnificent. I was able to finish the project happily by writing to it. And inevitably, Carpe defined the ending of the whole e perience. I was happy. I was smiling. And hopefully, our listeners were too!   To the over-arching inspirations:  Robert Hall Jr., we briefly spoke on Twitter about me doing a cover of \\\"Hip 2 Da Game\\\". You\\\\'ve always been a legend in my book. Though we lost communication after a couple weeks, I\\\\'m so thankful and appreciate that you took the time to actually respond to me. You didn\\\\'t have to, but by doing so you\\\\'ve pushed me further in so many ways.  Mac Miller, the most dope. Your original version of KAFP was literally half my middle school years. I still listen to your stuff and I am so glad you\\\\'ve found your spot in the industry and have planted your seat. You honestly deserve it after all the work you put in with those tapes man.  DJ Mustard, your music is everywhere I look. Seriously. EVERYWHERE. Usually if I listen to satellite radio, at least twice your production tag pops up. That\\\\'s how fast you get out hits and thats how much effort you put into your production. As a musician myself, you\\\\'ve made me take notice of the types of vibrations music can create. With yours, it\\\\'s always fun to listen to you\\u2014even if the concept and meaning in the song strays from that feeling\\u2014your production calls for people to party and enjoy their lives. Thank you for that  duction.  Tinashe, I remembered hearing of you in passing by so many of my friends or people I spoke to online. When you dropped \\\"2 On\\\", I finally listened to you. Forever more you\\\\'ve had a fan. I\\\\'m happy your career is skyrocketing and heading into such a positive direction and I hope that always continues.  Drake, one of the few straight up inspirations for this tape. Much of the tape was written as you rose into the limelight. Your work showed me that Hip-Hop didn\\\\'t have to just be Hip-Hop. It could be way more genres in just that one. You\\\\'re actually the first artist I can really say in the past decade who really defined for me what \\\"Hip-Hop/R&B\\\" was. Not many other artists were really proving to me why that slash was there between the two genres. I was hearing each of them separately until you blew up. In so many ways, you\\\\'ve showed me what music has grown to be and what it should continue to be. Hits. Lin-Manuel Miranda, your arrival as well as you and your original cast\\\\'s speeches to my school\\\\'s cast over our production of In the Heights did a lot for me. You have such eloquent words and such a soft spoken yet energetic personality. Meeting you changed a lot for that song which among 2 others is still in production and this entire project. Your poetry and lyricism has gone as far as to be acclaimed by Broadway just as well as by mainstream artists. That is something I forever hold as an ambition I want my life to\\u2014if not at least reach\\u2014surpass.  Manu Chao, from the amount of work I\\\\'ve heard in your album Clandestino and on, I can honestly say that your name deserves more credit than it already has. While I know that much of that album reached and touched simply the hearts of those in foreign Europe and Spanish countries, it reached all the way over into mine here in the United States. Your versatility in languages has also been a great influence in my work\\u2014in fact you\\\\'ve caused me to take the concept of being bilingual and even trilingual very seriously now. I\\\\'m terribly itching to hear another album drop by you.  Eddie Murphy, my king of comedy. I put you ne t to all the other greats. Cosby, Pryor, Cedric, Lawrence. But you\\\\'ll always be my favorite. With just two stand-ups you showed the world how belligerent yet parodic comedy and even drama has the ability to be. While your music career is often overlooked and your acting career is often underpraised, I say confidently and proudly that all your work, including your films and music has inspired me in the realm of entertainment and always will.  Mary J. Blige, to date all the way back to your first album shows how much I love your work. To be short, your evolution has been jaw-dropping. \\\"What\\\\'s the 411\\\", as classic as it was and still is\\u2014without a doubt is so different and di in nature compared to your most recent works. I was  duced to the final song of that album by the photographer of this project, Aja Adam, and since, was in awe and unable to fathom at times how point A What\\\\'s the 411 got to point B The London Sessions. Your voice to me has affected my generation to the likes of Patti Labelle and Chaka Khan in my father\\\\'s years of youth. If men could have your voice specifically if I could, I don\\\\'t know how the world would respond.  And to Joe McDermott, Allister Brimble, Nathan McCree and Keiichi Okabe, you are men who created the atmospheres and soundtracks of my childhood. You created the tunes I would hum everyday when I pretended to be in a zombie apocalypse, thought I could drive, wanted to venture into far off Egypt, practiced martial arts or just wanted to feel free from the stresses of my day. You also are one of the many inspirations for my original orchestrations and compostions. Thank you.    And oh my Gosh! How could I ever forget yo?!  HUGE shoutouts to PlayStation, Xbo , Windows and Macintosh. You are the realest of the real. The most underrated of the underrated. You all are harder than the coldest mountain peaks. YOU ARE THE REAL MVP\\\\'S. You have had my back since birth pretty much. You all were the main homies who came in clutch for this tape to happen. Whenever I was upset, whenever I was feeling a little too cocky so I went online or whenever I was bored out of my mind, you kept me going. You gave me just as many nightmares as you gave me dreams, but I forgive you for that. Seriously. I should have never sat and watched my Dad play Resident Evil 2. It has tormented me into my teenage years to the point where the destruction of such an intellectual erudition and segment of my childhood makes me cry heavy rains of tears.Capcom... Stop making RE games if you can\\\\'t make them good.I\\\\'m just joking around. This was a pretty long letter anyway, I had to break at some point.     And for the finale, to the main act who have sewn their souls and pure spirits so sweetly and courteously into this project: I thank you... Willow, Mama, my grandmother\\u2014for waking me up every morning for school when I was younger. For cooking my meals. For cleaning my clothes. For giving me words of wisdom and for teaching me how to do each of those things on my own as I\\\\'ve gotten older and I\\\\'m approaching manhood. Though I know you won\\\\'t be here forever, I\\\\'ve counted everyday I\\\\'ve had with you and cherished you in every moment I can. Without you, I wouldn\\\\'t be able to breathe. With you, every color is more colorful. Every word is more poetic. Our family is one because of you. We keep each other together. We look out for each other. When I come home I feel safest there because of your warmth and because of your uncontainable aura. I love you Mama, with every speck of my being.  Tack, Papa, my grandfather\\u2014for bringing laughs into my life. For showing me the importance of frugality as well as taking life slow. For teaching me to enjoy the little things. For mending some of the tools of my childhood and growth my game controllers, my action figures, my pens, my computers, my speakers, my keyboards,  and eventually my heart whenever it collapsed. Thank you for sharpening my eyes and ears, refining my mind and always telling me to analyze the world around me. Thank you for financing my dreams and believing in them no matter how far fetched you may have ever believed they were. You\\\\'ve always made things happen for me. I\\\\'ll pay you back one day. I promise. I will always remember you for that Papa. I will always hold you close to my heart.  Prince, Daddy, my father\\u2014for leading me up this path to creativity and showing me just as many of the evils to avoid in this world as the beauties you\\\\'ve taught me to take part in. Yes, we\\\\'ve had rough patches. Whether it be at home, in the middle of the street, over the phone or even in the studio. We can tend to fight. We clash. But as hard as that gets sometimes, I still love you. I can\\\\'t help but love you. This is just as much for everything you\\\\'ve worked to be as it is for everything I want to be and I have to be. Yes, I\\\\'ve runaway, yes, I\\\\'ve argued and yes, I may downright not listen sometimes. I\\\\'m a teenager. Sometimes, none of us can help it. I apologize. But, look at what we did. Look at how we got here. Look at where we\\\\'re going. We\\\\'re getting there. Don\\\\'t you think she\\\\'d be proud?  And by she...  I mean my mother. Sugar. Dulcey. I only knew you for a number of years. But, they were enough years to know you and always remember you. Thank you for bringing me into this world. Thank you for being here when you could. Thank you for being the benevolent soul I needed most when you came around. I wish you were here. Greatly. I wish you could sit here with us, laugh, smile and input your own ideas into things. But then again, you do. I listen back to tapes that have your voice on them. Ideas you were spawning on the spot or ideas you were returning to and they rouse some of the most interesting and unthought of ideas I\\\\'ve ever had sometimes straight to me. Every once and a while I\\\\'ll be sitting around just writing down lyrics or playing a song and I wonder where this specific note or that certain lyric precipitated from. Then I look up. And I think of you. Isn\\\\'t it lovely?    Lastly to God.  To God,  I obviously haven\\\\'t done all I can. I obviously am less than a man. I say to you I\\\\'ve been searching for you. Why haven\\\\'t you answered? I\\\\'ve argued about you. Argued for you. I\\\\'ve became so sore to your silence. Honestly it\\\\'s so quiet. I\\\\'m so tired I would rather sleep sometimes than to sit hear without sound it\\\\'s, Dead silent right here in my bedroom. I said to you the last time I prayed\\u2014 I don\\\\'t even remember what... Sometimes I\\\\'m discouraged And other times I like, resent not doing it. People say you don\\\\'t e ist. And though it seems you\\\\'re proving it, In that same dead silence you\\\\'re proving us wrong. You\\\\'re here. You\\\\'re hearing us. You\\\\'re hearing us in your ears. We\\\\'re just not listening enough to hear you in ours. We want you to cover our scars, But you\\\\'re telling us to do it ourselves, We have to do just as much work as you for this to work. This is a working relationship. Occasionally you\\\\'re a fable to me, But I know that you\\\\'re there. I got so many quotes of you by my bedside, That it\\\\'s hard to truly say that I think you\\\\'re a lie. Boy am I tired. I told you I\\\\'m tired. So tired but inside I\\\\'m feeling the fire. Please God could you answer? My phones \\\\'bout to die! But even if it does I\\\\'ll still wait for a reply. Cause I\\\\'ll climb to the highest mountain, And wait for the sun to rise, And hopefully there I\\\\'ll hear a word from you by that time. Bye bye.  I couldn\\\\'t say it to you in just simple synta . So I had to write it out like that. If you\\\\'ve gotten me this far, I\\\\'ll wait to see how far it goes. I know you\\\\'re taking care of me, and I hope you\\\\'ll keep taking care of the people I need you to.    Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you...     I don\\\\'t know what to say other than that. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"mood_cats\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 3,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          2,\n          3\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":27}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df[df['lyrics'].str.contains('part [1-9]', case=False)]"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":269},"id":"KuXb0Jd4eZCV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710032633098,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":309,"user":{"displayName":"Joshua Lee","userId":"12766360895124423633"}},"outputId":"def7d783-d9b1-459b-d2d8-50166745f9b2"},"execution_count":28,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                     lyrics_filename  \\\n","496                          Brian_Wilson___Surfs_Up   \n","2125             Dance_Gavin_Dance___People_You_Know   \n","2239                        John_Carpenter___Seasons   \n","2783                Amii_Stewart___Knock_On_The_Wood   \n","8184                    Black_Eyed_Peas___Positivity   \n","13218                              Ben_Jelen___River   \n","14204  Aretha_Franklin___Never_Let_Me_Go__LP_Version   \n","\n","                                                  lyrics  mood_cats  \n","496     - Part 1 -    A diamond necklace played the p...          0  \n","2125    Part 1: People You Know    Someone please!
